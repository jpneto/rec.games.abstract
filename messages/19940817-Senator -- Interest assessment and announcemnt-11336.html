Greetings friends:

A year or so ago, I ran a game called Senator, which is similar in
nature to the game "Nomic". The idea is very simple -- there are no
rules to begin with. The players propose and vote on rules, and the
game is shaped according to their whims. Thus at the beginning, there
is no way to win, yet winning is certainly a thing that can be defined
and implemented, according to the majority of the players. 

The game was played via email, and it turned out to be a good deal of
fun. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to do the things that I
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>needed<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to get done, and I had to stop the game before it formally
ended.

With more time on my hands, I'm going to be starting up a new game!

This time, things will be slightly different. Instead of email, the
game will be played via an internet server which I am currently
coding. Thus, all players must have access to telnet. I expect the
initial coding to be done in 3 to 4 weeks. In the meantime, I need the
following:

    o Players. Up to 50 players would be acceptable. Requirements:
      about 30 minutes a day (or more if you are zealous); a machine
      connected directly to the net so that you can telnet to the
      server; an excellent attitude; a sense of wanting to see things
      to their end; a good sense of humor; a creative imagination.

    o Testers: Up to 5 testers. Testers will directly test the server,
      trying as best as they can to crash it, by any means
      possible. You can be both a tester and a player. Requirements:
      30 minutes to 1 hour every few days; A sense of what makes
      programs crash because of unexpected user input; A machine which
      can telnet to other machines on the net; Some previous testing
      experience preferred, but not necessary.

    o A co-implementor. Only 1 co-implementor position available. I am
      wary about sharing this post with someone else, but I want to
      make very sure that I have enough resources to meet the needs of
      the game as it develops. If you are interested in being a
      co-implementor, I'll send you an application over
      email. Requirements: 30 minutes to 1 hour a day, sporadic 2 to 3
      hour programming tasks; a sense of justice; a good sense of humor;
      knowledge of Perl programming; a machine which connects directly
      to the internet and has telnet.

    o A machine. I am able to run the server on my machine only at
      nights and weekends, and even then, I will likely be causing
      people some difficulty. Since the server needs to be up all the
      time, I need a machine and a person with an account on that
      machine to be able to handle the day-to-day server issues. This
      person can also be a player, a tester, or the
      co-implementor. Requirements: a machine which connects directly
      to the internet; An account on this machine; Explicit permission
      by the system operator to run the server on the machine; Basic
      working knowledge of UNIX; Perl experience would be a plus, but
      is not required.

Please direct interest in any of the above needs to me, at:

Please make the subject line out as: SENATOR

Senator is starting up again!
