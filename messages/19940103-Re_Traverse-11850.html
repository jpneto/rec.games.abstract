	The only time I played Traverse was with two other people. I
wouldn't recommend the three-player game, because the opposite open row
is too much of an advantage. 
	There are other problems with three player games which are not
unique to Traverse. For example, one person who may be unable to win
can sometimes determine which of the other two will win.       
	In some games, such as Parcheesi, the in-between player is at a
disadvantage -- slowed down in front and chased from behind.
	That being said, if you are playing Traverse with people of 
varying playing skills, put the weakest player opposite the open row.
