<div class="moz-text-flowed">After playing a lot of time, after the 3 tournaments we did, and the 
thousand of game played online, we have seen just the opposite result... 
game are faster when they are played between two good players.
<br>
<br>For example, many good players don't do their birth if not strictly 
necessary... and go very quickly to the oppponnent territory. The middle 
part of the game is very critical, one bad move and the end of the game 
will be very fast.

<br>Hard to see how the characteristics of a website can make a game bad, or how
