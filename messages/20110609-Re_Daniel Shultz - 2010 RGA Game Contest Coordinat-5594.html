Thank you Daniel, for the effort you've put into this contest.
And a nice outcome, too -- I somehow like draws ;-)

Also many thanks to all who followed this contest with interest and
especially to Greg who contributed all the great programming stuff.

It was fun.

More about Mixtour in Nürnberg next year... :)

Thanks Dieter.  BTW, I'll stop analyzing the voting system, I suppose
I couldn't resist a good puzzle. :)  I will mention that the
combinatorial analysis of the voting system is very much like the type
of combinatorial analysis I frequently perform on ASG's and puzzles.

Thanks again to all those who made the contest possible, including all
of the competitors.  I thought the presentation of all of the games
was excellent, with some being real standouts.  I found something to
like about all the games, but found it difficult to have a clear
preference for many of the games since it was hard to say that one was
better, just different in their own right.  An analogy that come to
minds is figure skating.  How does one compare say a Scott Hamilton to
a Katarina Witt?  They're both excellent in their own right, but very
different styles.
