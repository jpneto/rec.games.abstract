Interesting post...

Go is no less a pure game of capture than a pure
game of territory, isn't it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Ralfs comments has been centered around the final goal and he clearly stated
that. So go is purely a game of territory in this sense. Even otherwise, not
considering only the final goal, I consider go a game of territory now

Logically, Phutball may be seen as a game of
connection as well. Or is it above all a game
about reaching a specific part of the board?
How do you decide the ball is best seen as a
normal piece which players move? And not as the
starting point of an electric circuit for
example? (I am seriously considering it both
ways nowadays, either when playing or when
designing an evaluation function.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Again, the final goal of Phutball is to move a piece somewhere. As a final
goal this is obviously the classification. In terms of strategy and
part-time goals, I would consider connection as well... but here, capture
seems more central than in Go. However, I have played too little to know if
this is the case.

Is trax made of two concurrent goals? Is one of
them about connecting two moving edges, or about
building up a pattern much as the other looping
goal? We could put Trax in the single class of
pattern games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I consider Trax a connection game. The argument would be that you either
connect a "path" to itself, or you identify the upper and lower, resp. the
left and right to see if they are connected.
