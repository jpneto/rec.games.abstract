With respect to voting, it should be a method everyone agrees on.  As
one possibility, I suggest condorcet voting among the contestants.

As for the proposed feature or mechanic, it should also be something
we're all interested in.  Here's one I'm curious about, because I have
trouble with it:

What you might call a cycling finite game.  The idea is to have a
stones-and-grid affair in which stones can both be added to the board
and removed, through capture or some other mechanism, but where
nonetheless the game is guaranteed to end and give one winner.  Ko
rule is not allowed, and the goal cannot be accomplished by limiting
the number of stones (ala Gipf).

I'm interested, but might I lobby for a strategic principle rather
than a mechanical principle? It's my own taste, but the tendency here
seems to be mechanical so I think it would be a refreshing change.

I've been playing around with the idea of having to predict your
opponent, putting a heavy burden on knowing how your opponent will
play, rather than how they could play. It's very hard to achieve this
without some kind of hidden information (simultaneous movement is
sufficient).

There are other areas I think would be fun to explore, that's just the
one I've been thinking most about. I'll happily participate however
you decide to do it.
