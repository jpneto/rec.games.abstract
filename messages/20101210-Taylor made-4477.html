Bill Taylor:

"Here I was, minding my own business in rec.games.abstract, when Christian
Freeling shows up like he owns the place and starts making himself at home.
Can you even imagine?  Naturally I introduced myself by denigrating his
game, and what does he do?  He tells me to go take a flying fuck!  What a
touchy bastard!!

Then later I'm having some good, clean fun, totally spamming
rec.games.abstract day after day after day.  Before you know it, my office
phone is ringing and it's the vice-chancellor of my university - grilling me
about rec.games.abstract!  Immediately I knew something despicable had
happened - a deliberate, despicable act had been perpetrated by the
despicable Mark.

So now rec.games.abstract is even more totally ruined than how I said it was
before.  Now there's touchy <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> despicable - all happening at the same
time."
