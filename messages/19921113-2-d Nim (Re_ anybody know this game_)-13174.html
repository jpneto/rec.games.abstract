The game is sometimes called 2-d Nim, and can be played with arbitrary
boards.  Draw an array of Xs, take turns crossing off a connected line
of Xs.  The last player to move wins (or loses, in the misere
version).

Like all impartial 2-player games, 2-d Nim can be analyzed with Nim
numbers.  (Well, probably not the misere version.  I don't understand
misere analysis yet.)

Computing the Nim values isn't hard, just somewhat tedious.

Finding general rules helps some.  Like:
  nim-value XX...X   = n (the number of Xs)

  nim-value XX...X   = n
            X

  nim-value XX...X   = n - 2, when n - 2 = 2 ** k
             X         n,     otherwise

Anyone want to explain nim values, nim sums, and the mex rule?
Perhaps this weekend I'll write a quick tour.
