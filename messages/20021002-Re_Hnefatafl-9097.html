2) In the combinatorial games literature which I own or to which I
   have easy access, I recall no discussion of these games (henefatafl
   specifically, not general "tafl" games such as 9 Men's Morris, Fox and
   Geese, etc).  Does anyone know of any?

I wish I did. Part of the problem is that there is no agreement on what
the rules were. There is more of a consensus on hnefatafl than on, say,
ludus latrunculorum. There is actually quite a bit of similarity among
many proposed reconstructions of the rules, especially more recent ones,
and many of the rules sets do make the game enjoyable.

Indeed, I played one of the Irish variants with my son last night on a 9x9
Go board (playing on the points rather than squares), and it was quite
good. I wish I had learned of this family of games sooner, it is much
deeper than it at first appears.

But even rather
minor differences in the rules can make a big difference in stategy and
tactics. Since there is not a large enough group of people playing the
game according to the same rules...

True, but my question was whether or not there was a more mathematical
body of work on this family of games, along the lines of Conway, Guy and
Berlekamp (so-called combinatorial games). Have you seen the "Games of No
Chance" proceedings from Cambridge Univ. Press, for example? From that
general viewpoint, one welcomes the variety of closely related rulesets in
order to speak with greater generality.
