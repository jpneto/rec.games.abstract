	I beleive you have the correct game.  Did you play it where you 
choose the peice your opponent places?  I have not ended a game in a draw 
(I've always won) but this may mean my opposition is weak and/or I've 
not played enough.  The one I played was all wood though.

	Have you tried the variation where a comlete corner of four peices
having the same attribute wins as well.

	I also have a question about the new game Quadrature.  I talked 
to the creator and he was selling it as being a "pure strategy" game.
No initial move advantage and no draw games.  I've seen it and read the 
rules but have never actually played the game.  I'd like to know how it 
plays.
