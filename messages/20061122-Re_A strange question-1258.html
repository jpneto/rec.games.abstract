You could also look at Halma or Chinese Checkers (which is neither
Chinese nor very much like Checkers).  Halma can be played on a normal
Chess/Checkers board, though it was originally designed for a 16x16
board.  These are both classic in the sense of being designed before
1900, and neither uses randomization.

That makes me think of another possibility--Reversi (Othello).  It can
also be played on the same board as chess and checkers.  There are only
two downsides in my mind:  (1) it dates back only to 1880 and therefore
seems "modern" in comparison to chess and checkers,

Halma and Chinese Checkers are of similar age.

and (2) I never liked reversi; I always found it frustrating (but
this could probably be cured with practice).

It is difficult (for a human) to think far ahead in Othello, so you
play it more with patterns than, say, Checkers or Chess.  Computers
can do deep searches very easily, so most programs do that (and win by
being able to do so).

Something I didn't mention in my original post:  it's also important to
me that the three games be well suited to playing against a computer
AI.  Frankly, that's how I play games almost exclusively nowadays, so
there's hardly any point in my getting interested in a game that would
require me to go looking for human opponents (even on the Internet).
I'll never bother to do it.  Part of the appeal of chess and checkers
is that there are some excellent and easily accessible computer
programs for both.

There are good computer programs for Othello/Reversi available too, at
all levels.  A fairly good implementation that you can play online can
be found at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.spee.nl/othello/applet.htm">http://www.spee.nl/othello/applet.htm</a> .

Another point of interest for me is related literature.  Chess has
possibly generated more literature than any other game in the world.
Checkers, not so much--but it's still easy to find "how to play well
and win" books on checkers.  I really like books like those, especially
if they come with puzzles or exercises which guide my thinking and
strengthen my game.

As time-honored a game as Nine Men's Morris is, I don't know that
there's much literature available on it.  Everything I know about the
game I've learned by trial and error.

I don't think I've ever seen a book or anything on Reversi either.

There is at least one: Othello: Brief and Basic, An introduction to
strategy and tactics for the game of Othello, Ted Landau, 1987.
