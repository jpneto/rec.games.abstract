I downloaded the game and played a couple times today.  I'm not
particularly good at these types of games, but I had no trouble
beating the computer.  Do you agree the computer seems to play very
poorly?

Greetings,

I recently downloaded a relatively new game for the Zillions engine,
called "The Game of Y" or simply "Y".

  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/y.html">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/y.html</a>


I have a few questions:

1) The Zillions board is slightly different than that of the board
shown in these two diagrams:

   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/gameofy.htm">http://www.gamepuzzles.com/gameofy.htm</a>
and
   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/the_game_of_y.html">http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/the_game_of_y.html</a>

Can I assume the boards shown in the above two links are the official
"Y" board, and the hexagon board used when playing with the Zillions
engine is simply one of many alternate boards to play on?


2) When playing "Y" against the Zillions engine, the swap rule, as I
understand it, is not being implemented correctly.

In Hex and other connection games (Twixt) where the swap rule is often
used, normally after Black makes an opening play, White then chooses
whether to take this move as his own (swapping) or simply let it be
and move elsewhere.  However, in this Zillions implementation, Black
moves, then White moves, and THEN White decides to swap colors.  (If
White does swap, in effect this gives Black the poorest first move
possible, but of course it's Black's turn again.)

Is this more than likely simply a mis-implementation of the swap rule
by the author (L. Lynn Smith) who implemented the game for Zillions or
is this unusual swap rule the official way to play "Y" ?


3) Does anyone have an e-mail address for L. Lynn Smith?
