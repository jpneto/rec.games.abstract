Hidden information does not mean only that players know the same

game like Batik the amount of relevant information cannot be entirely
known (there are issues of friction, gravity, etc. which are critical
to the game outcome). A computer simulation does not solve this
problem. If the simulation is too complex, we have basically the same
problem (even if both players know the algorithm, they are unable to
follow the computation). If it is too simple, it would not be a proper
approximation of the game it tries to simulate (imagine a Backgammon
software where the dice does not follow an uniform distribution). So,
Batik has hidden information, therefore it is not an abstract game.

Thank you, Joao.  If only there were more like you here and less
like... well, you get the idea.

If you accept Batik as an abstract game by enlarging the concept of
abstract games, then you would need to include games like Pick Up
Sticks [<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6424/pick-up-sticks">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6424/pick-up-sticks</a>].
This would make the concept too generic and not very useful.

Again, yes.
