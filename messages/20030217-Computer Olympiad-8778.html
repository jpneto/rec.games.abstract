23-27 November 2003, Graz, Austria
The 8th Computer Olympiad is a multi-games event in which all of the
participants are computer programs. The purpose is to find the strongest
programs at each of the games, partly as an academic exercise and partly
because the competitions are fun. This year's Computer Olympiad takes place
from November 23 to 27 and will be played at the Casineum in the Casino of
Graz, Austria. The organizing committee consists of: H.H.L.M. Donkers, J.W.
Hellemons (chair), H.J. van den Herik, H.M.J. den Hoed, P.A.M. van der
Krogt, J.W.H.M. Uiterwijk, and M.H.M. Winands. We are planning tournaments
for at least 18 different games:

        Amazons
        Backgammon
        Bao
        Bridge
        Chinese Chess
        8x8 Checkers
        Dots and Boxes
        10x10 Draughts
        Gipf Go
        9x9 Go
        Hex
        Lines of Action
        Othello
        Poker
        Renju
        Scrabble
        Shogi

We are willing to host more games, such as Tamsk, Zï¿½rtz, Twixt and Onyx but
we do not know of the existence of adequately playing programs. Therefore we
are awaiting suggestions on games to be adopted and proposals of programmers
of games not included in the list above.

For each game a 2003 tournament will take place provided that at least two
programs enter the tournament for that particular game. The detailed
tournament schedule will not be announced until the closing date for entries
which is October 31, 2003. Notification of entry acceptation will be given
before November 7, 2003. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals will be awarded to
the leading programs in each tournament. There will be no cash prizes.

The 8th Computer Olympiad will be held in conjunction with the ICGA 11th
World Computer Chess Championship 2003 and the 10th Advances in Computer
Games Conference.

The Tournament Director of the Computer Olympiad will be Professor Jaap van
den Herik from the Computer Science Department of the Universiteit
Maastricht.

The rules of the 8th Computer Olympiad will be published on this website.

The entry fees for the Olympiad are as follows:

        Amateur: US $ 25
        Semi-professional: US $ 250
        Professional: US $ 500

A participant is expected to be ICGA member (US $40).

"Amateur": programmers who have no commercial interest in their program, and
are not professional game programmers. Applications for amateur
classification must supply information to justify their claim.

"Semi-professional": Any program submitted by an employee or associate from
a games-programming company. The program's name must not be derived from or
similar to a commercial product.

"Professional": A program whose name is the same as or derived from a
commercial product.

Any entry received after October 31 will be subject to a penalty fee,
doubling the above fees.
