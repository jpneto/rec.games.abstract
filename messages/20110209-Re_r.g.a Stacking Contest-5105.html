The judging idea seems okay but I agree that there ought to be at
least 3 judges. It's hardly fair to the other entrants if
Schmittberger has some partiality for a particular designer. I'm not
doubting his integrity but I have to figure that at a subconscious
level it would affect how he reviewed the games. Two other judges
would balance this out. Oh and I would like to suggest a grading
system whereby the judges evaluate the games in a set of predefined
categories to make the evaluation process more objective.
