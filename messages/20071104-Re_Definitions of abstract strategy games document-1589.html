<br>You don't need a board for a game to be an abstract, and of coure 
there are plenty of card games demonstrate that quite well. 
However, I think there's a point in following pragmatism as well as 
notions of "purity", and card games don't need a new special 
association for them that lumps them in with GIPF and go, as they 
do quite nicely without one.
<br>
<br>But if you create an abstract card game that uses its own special 
deck rather than a traditional deck I can't see it being readily 
adopted by the card game community (says he, who isn't a part of 
that community, so it's a sketchily educated guess).
<br>
<br>ISTM that a higher level of definition may be useful, and would get 
around this sort of problem.&nbsp; Although Herman Hesse's fictional 
Glass Bead Game doesn't exist, <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>if it did<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> then it strikes me as 
being the ultimate abstract strategy game.&nbsp; But we'd have to rule 
it out here becuase there's no board and no pieces.&nbsp; So perhaps 
start the definition off with key elements such as "a contest" and 
the "outcome determined by the mental skill of the participnats" or 
the likes of that.&nbsp; That strikes me as far more fundamental, and 
probably more useful, than saying "we need a board and some bits".
