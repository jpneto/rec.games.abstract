YODD
=====


Yodd is a connection game for two players: Black and White. It is
played on the cells of a hex hex board, which is initially empty.

Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones of
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> color on empty cells. On his first turn, Black can only place
one stone.

At the end of each turn, there must be an odd number of groups on the
board.

Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the
previous rule (this means Black can't pass on his first turn).

When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with
less groups on the board wins. Draws are not possible.

______________


Double placement serves both as a first move equalizer and a way to
make the game playable under the group restriction rule.

Meanwhile, apart from the intended goal of eliminating draws (they
would be common otherwise), forcing an odd number of groups at the end
of a turn has some interesting tactical implications which make the
game feel similar to a single placement game. For example, groups
separated by two empty cells can't be joined on a single turn, since
the player runs out of stones to restore the groups count to an odd
number. Also, the diamond connection:

|  . o
| o .

is still unbreakable if the opponent can't fill the intermediate cells
by growing an existing group, or if he already has one group adjacent
to each of the two cells.

The effect reminds me of Joäo Pedro Neto and Bill Taylor's pet
modifier, under which two stones placed on a single turn can't be part
of the same group.

Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to
join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but
you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count
anymore!

Comments?

(The name of the game is still provissional. Does it sound well? My
ear is not much used to English, so your help is appreciated.
Alternatives: Yod ('Y' in Hebrew), Yotta ('iota' is 'i' in Greek),
Splyt, Oddy...)
