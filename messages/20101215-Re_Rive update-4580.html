That's correct.  So if you had a choice of placing a stone to join a three
and a four group or placing a stone to join a three and another three, you'd
join the three and the other three.  Because then the maximum, pre-existing,
on-board group you connected to would be a three, smaller than a four.

is it not, "A stone must be placed so that the largest

That's correct. It's not that.  That's something related to Oust, and Rive
is totally different.

One thing to bear in mind is that a "group" here includes both colors of
stones.  Not like Oust where a group is of like-colored stones only.  Colors
don't matter when adding and removing stones, except of course you want to
have more of your color on the board at the end of the game.
