This is all you really need to know, (the "Tromp-Taylor" rules):-
==============================================================

The Logical Rules
------------------
1. Go is played on a 19x19 square grid of points, by two players called Black 
   and White. 

2. Each point on the grid may be colored black, white or empty. 
   A point P is said to reach a color C, if there is a path of 
   (vertically or horizontally) adjacent points of P's color 
   from P to a point of color C. Clearing a color is the process 
   of emptying all points of that color that don't reach empty. 

3. Starting with an empty grid, the players alternate turns, starting with Black. 

4. A turn is either a pass; or a move not leaving a grid coloring left 
   by that player before. 

5. A move consists of coloring an empty point one's own color; 
   then clearing the opponent color, and then clearing one's own color. 

6. The game ends after two consecutive passes. 

7. A player's score is the number of points of his color, 
   plus the number of empty points that reach only his color. 

8. The player with the higher score at the end of the game is the winner. 
   Equal scores result in a tie.

Comments
--------
1. The grid of points is usually marked by a set of 19x19 lines on a wooden board. 
   Each player usually has an arbitrarily large set of stones of his own color. 
   By prior agreement a rectangle of different dimensions may be used. 

2. Using boards, coloring a point (intersection) black or white means 
   placing a stone of that color on the point. Coloring a point empty, 
   i.e. emptying a point, means removing the stone from it. 

3. For handicap games, the weaker player, taking black, may be given
   an "n stone handicap"; these are n consecutive moves played before 
   the first white move. In some variants these must be played on named points.

4. This is the "situational superko" rule. 
   ("Positional" superko ignores whose turn it is.) 

5. Note that for any single move, at most one of the clearing processes 
   can have effect; the first is called capture, the second suicide. 

6. After both players say "pass", they may by agreement remove any stones before
   continuing with rule 7.  If they fail to agree in full, the game continues, 
   treating those sayings as "unofficial", so the last mover's opponent should 
   make the next move.

7. This is called "area scoring". The so-called "captured" stones are irrelevant.

8. By prior agreement a fixed amount, "komi", can be added to white's final score.
   It can be made non-integral, to avoid ties. It should be made odd so results
   agree with "territory" scoring in almost all games.  7 is recommended as komi.
