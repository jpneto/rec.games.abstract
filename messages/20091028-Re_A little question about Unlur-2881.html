I think you are right.  I've been designing games featuring the "one
player tries to build it, and one tries to block it" for a long time,
and there's no problem with this kind of game.  It can be applied to
just about any pattern.  here's a recent one:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-coil">http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-coil</a>

This one is just like unlur except one player is trying to make a loop
in a certain color, and the other is trying to block it.

Because this scheme can be applied to just about any pattern, it opens
up a whole universe of games that aren't really available any other
way.

I designed a meta game, called Mind Ninja, that takes advantage of the
fact that the scheme can be applied to any pattern.

It goes like this:

1.  One person specifies a pattern (which in this case can be composed
of stones of either or both colors, as well as empty spaces.)
2.  The same player places any number/combination of stones on the
board that he wishes (a super-generalized pie rule).
3.  The other player decides whether to try to build the pattern or
block.
4.  The players take turns placing a single stone of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> color onto
the board, until either the pattern is build or the board is full.
5.  If the pattern is built, the builder wins, and the blocker wins
otherwise.

There's a slightly more elaborate version where the players first bid
either stones or clock time for the right to specify the pattern in
step 1 above, to eliminate any possible knowledge asymmetry.

Hi all,

Yesterday, when I was skimming through Cameron Browne's impressive
book "Connection Games: Variations on a Theme", I came across the
Unlur rules, which I thought I knew well, and was amazed to (re)
discover that a player loses if he makes the opponent's winning
connection with his own pieces. As Browne notes, this implies that
some moves by either side may actually damage that side's position,
which looks a bit strange in connection games. Then I wondered why the
rules doesn't avoid this by simply stating: "Black wins if he makes a
Y which touches three non-adjacent sides of the board and loses if he
can't possibly do it". Wouldn't it be more elegant, and thus
preferable? Is there any obvious fault with this that I can't see?
