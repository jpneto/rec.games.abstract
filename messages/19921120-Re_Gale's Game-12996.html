			   GALE'S GAME
   Gale was a mathematician of the 19th century who invented
   and studied a number of funny games, amongst which the one
   discussed in this message, that I will refer to as "Gale's Game".

   Gale's Game is a pretty simple paper and pencil game that involves
   2 players and an ordinary (rectangular, m*n squares) grid.

   The players play in turns; the one who plays last has lost.
   Playing consists in choosing a free square and then colouring
   the squares which are above and/or right of the chosen square.
   The coloured squares cannot be chosen again.
   Quite abviously, the last move consists in choosing the lower
   leftmost square.

   Here are the moves of a (rather silly) game on a 3*2 grid:
   Player2 plays A1:

	1   2   3
	--- --- ---
    A  |*** *** ***|

    B  |___ *** ***|



   Player1 plays B1 (and loses...):

	1   2   3
	--- --- ---
    A  |*** *** ***|

    B  |*** *** ***|



I'm confused here.  On any MxN board, doesn't player 1 just have to play
at (M-1, 1) to win? i.e.



	1   2   3         N
	--- --- --- ...  ---
    A  |*** *** *** *** *** |

    B  |*** *** *** *** *** |

       |....................|
 MM-1  |XXX *** *** *** *** |

   MM  |___ *** *** *** *** |
