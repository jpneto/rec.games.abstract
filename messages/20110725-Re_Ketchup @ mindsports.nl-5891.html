Criticizing a game as an entity is obviously fair game.
You picked one rule and used it to argue, out of context, against finitude.

I have nothing against finitude if it comes naturally. But robbing the
babies of their natural behaviour with a hardwired 'solution' before
determining the extent of the problem is silly. But then, Mark's
cyclophobia is silly of course, and making the queens mobile drains is
an artificial 'one purpose' rule.
I also don't get the two never to be born babies, not even to keep up
the facade of a stacking game.

I really don't want to take sides in an ongoing argument between two
of my favorite game designers, maybe my top two in fact, something I
hate to see in the first place.  Maybe I should have stayed out.  My
only interest was in trying to keep the debate logical.

No harm done Michael, but we're sidetracking the thread indeed. Have
you played Ketchup yet? (I mean the final version, or 'another final
version' as Mark would put it :) .
It's quite intruiging really.- Hide quoted text -

I have not played it yet, though it's interesting enough for me to
want to try it.  Connection games are among my favorites.  Hard for me
to know if the rule about when you can place three is sufficient to
avoid the tendency for the first large group to win.  And I don't
especially like the rule about comparing second largest, third
largest, etc. to avoid ties, because it seems arbitrary to me.  I
don't think anyone would intentionally play in such a way as to build
a large second-best group, and in fact it might even be bad strategy,
so winning that way seems to me completely serendipitous.  Better to
call it a draw if the largest groups tie, or give the win to the last
player to have the largest group.
