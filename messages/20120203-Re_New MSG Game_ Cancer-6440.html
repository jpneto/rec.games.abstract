Since it is an elimination game, "Go variant" might raise
an eyebrow or two. Further doubt may be fuelled by the fact that
there's no counting and that the size or color of the captured groups
don't seem to matter all that much, except in the vacant territory
they leave behind. So what's the strategy, sitting it out till
gridlock? That may be quite a while.

I've got a similar concern. Go without passing is an excellent
elimination game, but the size of territories does matter because the
opponent can't kill a living group of yours unless you fill in its
eyes yourself, so in the end whoever has a largest amount of territory
before the deadlock is usually the winner. In Cancer, living groups
can be killed long before the deadlock occurs, but I'm not sure yet if
this is a problem or a feature. One thing which must be taken into
account is that killing a living group with big eyes is very costly,
as you only get a single cancer stone each time you fill in an enemy
territory.

Anyway, if it's a problem, there's an easy solution: just remove the
whole "Filling eyes with cancer" section of the rules, so that living
groups can't be captured by the opponent before the deadlock. This is
even simpler than the original game, and possibly better.

But I'm sure Mark can cast some light here.
