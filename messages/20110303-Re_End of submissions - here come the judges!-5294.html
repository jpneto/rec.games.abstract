Two
issues.
  1) Ethical conflict.  You're the contest organizer.  So now the other

I could write my score secretly, have everyone including myself turn

  2) You bizarrely opened a discussion on the admissibility of my game, six

  qualification out of the water.  Like I said, I don't want to dwell on

Dieter made a stacking definition, 2 days! into the competition and I
agreed with it.
I went to Poland.
When I get back I make the 100th post.
Mark submits Monkey Queen
Ralf invites me to a stacking forum to call me weak in third person..
I ask him if he's a dick in real life or just online.
I get banned from the stacking forum.
I think, "I should probably take this jab to check the games to make
sure they fit the requirements"
I find that Stax and Monkey Queen break the rules I think are in place
and have been in place since day 3! when I agree to the stacking
definition (and day 1 hidden information).
I open it up for discussion "questionable entries" as opposed to
"disqualified" thinking that obviously I missed something when I was
gone and maybe someone could point it out.
Instead I get you being a dick, calling me irresponsible/unqualified
and suggesting we not dwell on it.
Now I'm here irritated and explaining myself.

The conclusion to the 'questionable entry' inquiry was to keep both
games in the contest as I hoped it would be.  No deductions in points
for either the inspired by stacking feature or the hidden information,
unless of course the hidden information makes the game less
interesting etc...

Focus, Daniel.  The idea that me and Christian and others have proposed is
for each judge to have 100 points which they can distribute to the games any
way they wish.  To that I would add the following suggestion:  The judges
submit their scores to you independently, without knowledge of each other's
scores.  Once you have all of the judge scores, which you should keep
confidential until you have all of them, you immediately make the all the
scores public and we see who wins.

I think there should be some discussion of a tiebreaker, however unlikely
one may be.  With an odd number of judges, each judge could cast a single
vote for his favorite game in the tie, but if there are only two judges then
I don't know what.
If there can only be two judges, I'm ok with that, though I think you should
still try to get a third, if at all possible, Daniel

Sounds good.  I have some ideas for a third judge.  I imagine that

For future contests:
Rules on a pdf file or some other easily printable file would be a
welcome requirement.
Someone will probably have to print all of the rules for the judges if
they're to be played in person and it's a lot nicer not to have to
reformat the page so that the text doesn't get cut off.

I quickly printed all of the games rules at work and Grabber, and

Why not play the Axiom game?  It can be set to play human vs. human if
that is desired.
The same would apply to all of the games which have computer

I should have also mentioned that mono is also required due to
the .NET dependency.
Never having tried it myself (I only have PC's), I only know that it
works because others who have tried have told me so.

Kenny Jenkins who posted on BGG about it working was on Linux.  I
emailed him and he said it works fine.  I guess a mac is a different
story.  I downloaded and installed mono a while back and it still
didn't work.  That was me who posted to your Axiom forum about the
same thing.

I find the whole concept of wine really cool and hadn't really checked
it out until this.
