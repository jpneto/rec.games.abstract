Interesting game - I suspect that Mr. Steere would poo-poo it for
being theoretically infinite (though I agree that it will likely be
finite in practice)!

That's ok, Nick.  People can't resist mutilating my games, in this
case what was, prior to mutilation, one of the most accessible games
imaginable.  A one year old could play Basic with a $3 Checkers set.
Now take Basic's most prominent features, its uber simplicity and its
finitude, and toss them out the window.  Then add an uninspired
mechanism whereby neither player has incentive to stack onto the
other, only to be carried backward.  I don't know what happens in this
variant.  I guess each player stacks his own checkers together and
tries to hussle them off the board as quickly as possible, with
uniformly but oppositely colored stacks flowing past one another,
unimpeded.  Either that or the two armies meet at an impasse in the
middle and start jogging in place.  Either way it isn't pretty.

Let's assume that this variant is even a game, which is a huge
assumption for me at this point.  Just because you can't see how
there'd be a draw doesn't mean experienced players won't figure it
out.  Why even take a chance like that?  It's like I want to sell you
a car with no spare tire because you're unlikely to get a flat.  What
if it turns out you get a flat every time you drive because the tires
are shitty?  It would be asinine in any other field but here it's ok.

I actually share some of the blame for this discussion.  My mention of
Basic's game tree was just supposed to be an aside, an "oh, by the
way" type of thing.  What I was trying to put across was how simple
Basic is, but one look at the rules and you can see that anyway.  If
I'd only not mentioned the game tree...
