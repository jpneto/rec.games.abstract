Note that Majorities is Reiner Knizia's Stonehenge without numbered discs:

A minor difference is that Stonehenge can have tied lines. This is neatly solved by awarding them to the player who didn't place the last stone in them. I like this rule about as much as Bill's solution (removing some cells so that all lines are odd-sized). It does require to mark ownership of lines as soon as they're completed, but Majorities could use that as a visual aid anyway.
