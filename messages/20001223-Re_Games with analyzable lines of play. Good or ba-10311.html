I would suggest that if I could come up with an algorithm that would 
guarantee at least a draw for white (we know that such an algorithm
exists) then chess would be solved. To do so, I do not need to store
as massively vast a set of games as previous posts have implied.

Most of us would probably assume that such an algorithm exists, but I 
don't think it has been proven.

As regards solving chess, I think it is unlikely but conceivable.  Any 
position that can be shown to be a win for one player can be eliminated. 
 It may be possible to prove rules about classes of positions that are 
won for one player under certain conditions.  For example, maybe if one 
player is a Queen up and cannot be checked by the opponent or 
have a piece captured without loss of material by the opponent in the 
next four moves, and certain mobility conditions apply, that may be a 
win.  (By mobility conditions, I mean to eliminate exotic constructed 
positions which might break such rules).
