Corey Clark also ridiculously claims to have Asperger's.  He really is poorly adapted socially but it's simply because he's a back stabbing asshole.

The only incident of "back-stabbing" was when you released that fucking expose of yours on how I'm a serial killer in training. You even just fucking made stuff up out of thin air. Your claim is that I betrayed you by mentioning your Christmas money. Like I said iggamecenter is not a private chat-room, There is no reason I would consider anything you told me there a secret unless you explicitly said so. But I really don't see where your privacy was breached, it was Gamerman who found out about your status. As for me, I was just doing damage control because I'd already gotten over the "retard" remarks and all that but that post was beyond the fucking pale. And let me remind you, you exposed yourself dingus. You could have said "alright I'll leave it at that retard." and that would have been the end of it. Like have some fucking sense. You cast a barrage of serious aspersions on me that I have to put into context or outright reject and you get blackmailed. Sorry, thems the breaks.
