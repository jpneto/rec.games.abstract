It seems that you have some interesting ideas here, but, I'm not sure
I quite understand what you are trying to achieve. Are you looking for
ways to further study the game of Chess through a series of "testing"
positions and their potential strengths...or are you trying to figure
out a way to blend chance elements into the game of Chess for the
interest of developing a workable diversion to Chess?

For me, there is plenty of subjective probability in chess without adding objective randomness. I'm interested in improving game analysis. From
the computer side, adding randomness may allow one to achieve better evaluation functions (analogous to the successful evaluations of backgammon
programs), and possibly more effective search techniques (analogous to rollouts). From the human side, I'd bet that the analysis returned by the
computer would make more sense, and would lead to easier generalizations.
