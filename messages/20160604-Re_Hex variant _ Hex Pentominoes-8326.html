no, Hex needn't be rethought (shit all over), as its one of the most objectively perfect games, probably the most perfect in a comprehensive sense.. If there is a lacuna for one Hex derivative or another, high caliber designers like Myself or Luis or Nick Bentley or Mark Steere will be the ones to fill it. Not you.

There is no other game that is TOTALLY FLAWED than Hex game.
Based on an obvious fact (read what I wrote before) it is the most crappy abstract game.  
Lacuna? ha ha ha 
Hex game itself is a huge lacuna
