Thank you for the post; I enjoyed your web site and would like
to take a look at your graph theoretic results when I find some
spare time.  Your game would be related to DAO which in fact was
discussed here last month -- you can search groups.google.com for
group:rec.games.abstract DAO; rules below.  Tentative conclusion
by this group, was "draw"; perhaps your program can be modified
to furnish an easy proof.  Honestly, your game sounds more
interesting than DAO although I would need some time &amp; info in
order to visualize your analysis and draw conclusions regarding
its viability as a game.  Have you playtested it against yourself?

The rules of Dao appear to be:

1. Start in this position:

   O . . X
   . O X .
   . X O .
   X . . O

2. X moves first, and then players alternate.

3. A move consists of moving one piece horizontally, vertically, or
   diagonally.  The piece must move at least one space, and must keep
   moving in that direction until it reaches the edge of the board, or
   the next space is already occupied.

4. A player wins by achieving any of the following.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a horizontal or vertical row.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a 2x2 square.  All four of the player's pieces in
   the four corners.  One of the player's pieces in a corner and the
   three adjacent spaces all occupied by the other player.

By combining the rules of Neutron and Teeko,
I came up with a game that I have described
at the bottom of

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm">http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm</a>

with emphasis on the computer analysis that
I have done. There isn't any graphics or
anything so far, but hopefully some will
find it interesting anyway. The web page
may become updated now and then over the
next few days and weeks.
