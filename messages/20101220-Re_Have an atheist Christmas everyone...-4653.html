Coincidentally, and unbelievably, this from today's news:

"In the 1970s, pedophilia was theorized as something fully in conformity
with man and even with children," the pope said. "It was maintained � even
within the realm of Catholic theology � that there is no such thing as evil
in itself or good in itself. There is only a 'better than' and a 'worse
than.' Nothing is good or bad in itself."

Like, "What could be more natural?" lol  "If it's such an emergency, I'll
issue an edict or something."
