You are enraging because all people know now that you are plagiarizer!!! 
ha ha ha 
If you have heart disease stop reading me. Otherwise you will be sent to the emergency care.
Can you understand what the term capturing means?
No.
What do you do when you take control of more territory than your opponent?
Oh! yes! you are too dumb that capturing is only to size ammunition of your ennemy. Taking them prisonners is not capturing! Taking more land is not capturing!!! Taking the hills to have more power is not capturing!!! When you take more points than your opponent you are not capturing!!!

ha ha ha
I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE SOMEONE DUMB AS YOU.
 
FUCK YOU BIG ILLITERATE!!!
