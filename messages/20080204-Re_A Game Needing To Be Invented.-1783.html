Assume you have a board that includes the pattern for one
colour.  Now make a copy of the board but in reverse colours and embed
both these boards in a larger board and fill out the remaining hexes
randomly.  This board will now have the pattern for both sides.

Right.  What I was saying about the highly gifted individual - it
happened sooner than I expected.  I think what Torben said settles the
matter, but one additional note:

If the given pattern were the dark squares pattern on an even sided,
square checkerboard, then a 90 degree rotation of that pattern (or a
mirror image of that pattern) could be superimposed on it.  In this
case the smallest board that would accommodate the given pattern would
also accommodate its rotation.  However, achieving the given pattern
would <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>guarantee<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that your opponent achieved the rotated pattern, not
preclude it.
