Actually, Singapore is the first country besides China to implement the
points rating system for Xiangqi. It was implemented late last year. I
participated in the National Xiangqi Open last year after an absence of
4 years. My rating is the region of 2100+ and I expect it to improve
this year. The National champion and some national Xiangqi players
having ratings in the region 2300-2500+.
 
I am not sure what point system Singapore Xiangqi Federation uses as I
am not in the committee.

Contra-cannon opening
: 
: 1.  Che3   Cbe8
A very old opening variation indeed. More 'modern' variations of the
contra-cannon are:  
  1.  Che3  Hg8
  2.  Hg3   Rh10
  3.  Rh1   Ch4
  4.  g5    Cbe8
The above variation is more 'flexible' as Black can always select
other openings at move #3.
Many books have been written on this contra-cannon opening.

: 2.  Hg3    Hc8
Other choice for Black is Hi8

: 3.  Rh1    Hg8
: 4.  g5     Rb10
Not a good choice by Red. Perhaps 4. Rh7 should pressure Black's horse
more.
: 5.  Hc3    Rb5
: 6.  Ei3    i6
Another weak reply by Red. Should have sacrifice the solider. Black
dares not take it because Black Horse on g file would be exposed:
  6.  Rb1   Rxg5
  7.  Ce2   Rh10
  8.  Cg2   Rd5
  9.  Ege3 and Red has a very good position. 

Similarly, not a good move by Black's i6 . Probably did not foresee
7. Rh7

: 7.  Rh7    Hge9
Do not understand why Black has to sacrifice Cannon. Could have played
 7.  ...    Ei8
 8.  Rg7    Rg10 and then Hge9 to exchange the Rooks.


: 8.  Rxh8   g6
: 9.  Ca3    gx5
: 10. Rb1    Rxb1
: 11. Hxb1   g4
: 12. Hh1    Cxe4+
: 13. Ade2   c6
: 14. Hf2    Cxa4
Another disastrous move by Black. Did not calculate that Black's Horse
is unprotected when Cannon moves away from e file. Probably should have
consolidate its defence by 13. ...    Ege8.

: 15. Rxc8   Ea8
: 16. Cxa7   Rh10
: 17. Cb7    f4
: 18. Rxa8   e4
: 19. Cb10+  Hc10
: 20. Cxe7   Ge9
: A few minutes left...
: 21. Rxa4   Rh7
: 22. Ce5    Rb7
: 23. Cxd10  Rxb1
: 24. Cd6    Rxc1+
: 25. Ad1    d4
: 26. Ra7    c5
: 27. Re7+   Gd9
: 28. Rd7+   Ge9
: 29. Ce6+   Gf9
: 30. Rf7X   1-0

Red has won the game by move 13 due to sloppy play by Black. Perhaps
Xiangqi beginners should concentrate their opening just by using solely
the central cannon opening and ignoring other more subtle openings such as the
Elephant opening which requires very good middle and end-game skills.

As for Black, the reply to Red 1. Che3   would be:

1. ...     Che8    Same direction cannon opening
2. Hg3     Hg8
3. Rh1     Ri9 

1. ...     Hg8
2. Hg3     Rh10
3. Rh1     g6
4. Rh7     Hc8   (forgot name coined to this opening) 

1. ....   Hc8
2. Hg3    Chf8
3. Rh1    Hg8     sandwiched cannon opening

1. ....    Hc8
2. Hg3     Ri9
3. Rh1     Rd9     (forgot name coined to this opening)

and of course the contra-cannon opening above.

: Black: NN
: Time:  30+30 minutes
Same direction cannon opening
: 
: 1.  Cbe3   Cbe8
: 2.  Cxe7+  Cxe4
Puzzling moves by both sides...
Red should not gain a soldier at the expense of letting Black's pieces
to be developed first. Even worst move by Black, by all standards.

: 3.  Ce5    Ra9
: 4.  Ch6    g6
Red should play 4. Hg3 . Black cannon cannot move from e4 as Red
threaten double cannon mate. Red would have capture a Cannon and win the
game easily.
: 5.  Ch7    Ge9
: 6.  Ce7+   Gf9
: 7.  Ri2    Cxe7+
: 8.  Cd5    Ce8X
: 9.  0-1
