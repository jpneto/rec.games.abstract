A problem with this definition is that a set

even if one player is better than another,

Gerry, if I understand you what you're saying, then I respectfully
disagree.

Yes, the more games you play, the better chance the stronger player will
have to prove his superiority.  This is obvious since we all know a one
game match by itself means almost nothing.  But even if two players
play, for example, a 1,000 game match, a player "one step up" in playing
ability will still only win about 75% of the games.  That's what it
means to be one step up... he's going to win about 75% of the time.  In
fact, the more games played in this match or series, the closer to the
actual 75% percentage we will get.

Thus, increasing the number of games played doesn't "reduce the effect
of chance".  Again, the stronger player one step up is not strong enough
to win all of the time... that's a given... that's why he's only one
step up.  To repeat, increasing the number of games simply means the 75%
figure will be closer to the actual result.

If one is 'two' steps up one will win about 92% of the time.  (Here I'm
specifically talking about ELO ratings and chess and looking at such a
chart for a player two steps (400 points) up in one of my chess books,
although this expectancy chart and table can probably be used for other
games.)

I'm also don't agree there will be "an increase in the number of
levels", simply because a game has variable results.  As we all know,
backgammon (although still a game of skill!) has much more of luck
element to it than chess does, but backgammon certainly doesn't have any
more levels (steps) than chess.  One may be able to argue it has the
SAME number of levels (there exists 1200 players, 1400 players, 1600
plaeyers, etc.) but it certainly doesn't have more.
