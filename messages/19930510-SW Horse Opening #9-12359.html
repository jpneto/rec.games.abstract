SW Horse #9

Red 56 cannon vs Black A6+5 variation


In the last post, Black uses A4+5 variation after Red's H7+6. Now, Black
uses A6+5 variation. Do look out for the subtle differences between these
two variations :)

1  C25   H2+3
2  H2+3  C86
3  R12   H8+7
4  C86   R12
5  H8+7  C21
6  S7+1  S7+1
7  H7+6  A6+5
8  R9+2  E7+5 (See diagram)

In move #8, Red plays R9+2 instead of R2+6 as in post #8. This is to bring
the Red Rook into play and possibly, R98 exchange with Black's more active
Rook. Red would then transform into the cross court cannon structure (see my
two postings on Xiangqi structures).

On the other hand, in move #8, if Black had played A4+5 as in post #8, it
would not be advisable to play E7+5 in move #8 since Black's left Horse
could not retreat H7-6 if Red plays R2+6 and R23. Instead Black should play
R98 exchange Red's right Rook.
    

9  R2+6  R97 To get ready for Red R23 and play H7-6 exchange Rooks.
10 R98   R2+7
11 C58   C1+4
12 C8+1  (See diagram)

Now I shall adapt the moves from a game which Hu Rong Hua played in 1985 on
his way to his 12th championship titles. (Note: Hu has not won the National
championship since then)

12 ...   S7+1!
13 S3+1  H7-9!
14 R2+2? R7+5
15 H6-5  R73
16 C87   R3+1
17 C6+5  R3+3
18 C64   H3-1! Black Horse could now move into attack.

In move #13, Hu sacrifice a Horse to gain an opportunity to attack Red's
left wing. Of course, Red downfall is due to his greed in accepting the
gambit. If Red had been more sensible and played 14.  R2-2 then the game
would still be evenly matched. Eventually, Hu won this game quite
comfortably.
