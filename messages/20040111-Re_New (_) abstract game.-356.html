instead.  That wouldn't help Vertical win, of course, which we can prove
much more directly by looking at your proposed rules...

  So obviously if the first player chooses a starting position such
that only a horizontal move can possibly win the game, then of course
he'll win!  (He can also throw the game by choosing a starting position
such that only a vertical move can possibly win the game.)

  At first glance: All the way to the right edge.  That creates a dead end
accessible only horizontally, so Horizontal wins automatically.
  However!: that would prevent the snake from passing through all four of
the lower-left-hand-corner points; thus Vertical would challenge
Horizontal and Vertical would win.
  After some paper-and-pencil brute force, I think Horizontal should
challenge Vertical to complete the snake.  Since Vertical won't be able
to do it (and almost certainly not if we put a time limit on him and
disallow computer analysis), Horizontal will win by default.
