Oh, someone else already came up with the same idea before me? Well,
that's not too surprising considering the rules are pretty logical and
the "checkerboard" initial setup seems to be one which results in a
significant degree of playability, not to mention symmetry.

The only difference is the initial setup for Lewthwaite's game is 
B W B W B
W B W B W
B W _ W B
W B W B W
B W B W B
while mine is 
_ B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W.

Incidentally, what's the proof of the second player win for the former
setup and does it carry over to the latter setup? I don't have the
book Winning Ways and it's out of print anyway.
