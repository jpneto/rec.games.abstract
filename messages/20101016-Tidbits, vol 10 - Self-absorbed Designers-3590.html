Designers are given to exuberance, so I grant them, and myself, a
little slack in this regard.  But the shit I'm hearing lately is
nauseating.  Designers announcing half baked concepts while profusely
congratulating themselves for their brilliance.

Matteo Perlini's gushing self-adulation on bgg:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I asked myself whether it would be possible to enhance the
value of the pie rule... At first sight this goal seems
impossible...  This is how I have adapted the pie rule to
my idea...

At the moment the game is unnamed...  I have tested this game
4/5 times, not enough to form an informed opinion. My big
doubt is how drawish the game is.

We're already knee deep in champagne corks popped by Christian
Freeling in his own honor.  And the stories - FUCK I hate the
stories.  A Christian Freeling classic:

"I had just shat a lovely green turd when a fireworks factory
explosion leveled my whole neighborhood, leaving only me on my toilet,
exposed and stranded, and a pile of ash where the toilet paper once
was.  Yet I soldiered on in the face of certain dingleberries..."

And of course Ralf Gering, Asshole of the Decade, lost in a
schizophrenic fantasy in which his own shit games are by far the best
in the world.
