The pie rule might be great in the minds of some but I think I've
found a solution to the first player advantage in Hex that is a little
more elegant. I can think of several reasons the pie rule is not the
best solution, even with my limited knowledge of Hex theory. Firstly
if the pie rule were such a highly effective solution to the first
player advantage in Hex, this would imply that some spaces on the
board are inherently bad positions for red or that one certain spot on
the board is crucial to exploiting this advantage, neither of these
statements are true. The pie rule is also not effective between
players with fairly disparate skill levels. Many people do not even
know for which moves to invoke the pie rule even though this can be
researched easily enough.

A-hex (Asymmetric Hex) is a game of Hex specifically designed to be
played without the pie rule. Horizontal lines split 3 of the central
hexes in two, so the board naturally favors blue. I'm not sure if this
particular arrangement is the best way to do this because my knowledge
of hex theory is limited. I used this [url]<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.hexwiki.org/">http://www.hexwiki.org/</a>
index.php?title=Small_boards[/url] as a guide. I noticed that the
hexes running down the middle of the board diagonally from the top
right corner to the bottom left hand corner are recommended swaps for
blue, regardless of board size. I started with the 5 most centralized
hexes in these positions however this seemed to overcompensate. It
ended up being a fairly modest modification.

Of course A-hex could be played in tandem with the pie rule to improve
even more on the first player advantage in Hex.

If anyone with a passable Hex game wants to help me play test A-hex
with the use of the always versatile Google Docs, please contact me.
If you have a problem with me renaming Hex based on such a slight
modification to the Hex board, you can take that up with my ego. I
warn you, he's a biter. :D
