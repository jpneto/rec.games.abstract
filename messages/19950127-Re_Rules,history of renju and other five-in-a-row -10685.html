I have heard several claims of this, but I have also heard several
claims that the proofs are seriously lacking in details.  That is to
say, that there is an incomplete argument falsely claimed to be a
proof.

Victor Allis has solved go-moku (i.e. searched the game tree and found 
a win).  His report (as well as another on the solution to connect four,
and his thesis discussing solutions to Qubic and nine men's morris) is 
available for ftp, but I seem to have deleted all references to it in
a fit of housecleaning after printing it out.  I believe he took a
perfect go-moku player to one of the computer games Olympiads, so
there may be a reference in _Heuristic Programming in Art. Int. 3_.
He also has a recent paper (1994) in Artificial Intelligence which
could give a pointer.  My recollection is that he solved both the 
unrestricted version of go-moku, and one which prohibits black overlines.
Perhaps someone here remembers this and can give more details.
