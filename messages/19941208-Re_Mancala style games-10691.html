I went to Kenya last week and also bought a couple of more normal boards.
They told me that it was known as Bao but there you are.  I did see 
boards like this however and asked about them.  Apparently you play them
in just the same way as Mancala (or whatever) - its just that essentially
because the board would be so long with 16 pots on either side, they just
fold each side in half.  I would imagine that your square holes are the
equivalent of the home holes.  The rules to this hybrid game have been
posted all over the place so you shouldn't have much difficulty.
