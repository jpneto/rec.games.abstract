<br>As I understand the problem, a strategy is sought which should
<br>work for all participants. This strategy can't be of the type
<br>"choose k" which fixed k, because if all participants would
<br>play with this strategy, no one would win. So some type of
<br>randomness has to be included.
<br>
<br>I think an optimal strategy would be one which wins one play
<br>out of every n plays in average. A better result cannot be
<br>expected if you do not know what the other players will do.
<br>Choosing one of the numbers {1,...,n} by chance is the first
<br>idea coming to mind. However, this does not win one out of n
<br>plays, because it still will happen that all players choose
<br>the same number (in average every n^(n-1) plays). And a player
<br>who chooses the number 1 at every play would would win against
<br>players playing this strategy. So the numbers {1,...,n} have
<br>to be chosen with certain probabilities, where the small
<br>numbers have to be preferred. What is the optimal probability
<br>distribution?
