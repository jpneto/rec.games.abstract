Mark, after reading this idiotic post I can only respond by calling
you a stupid asshole. Sorry. Next time try to give me more to work
with. Okay, back to the topic at hand. You "old guys" is a term for
you guys who have been inventing games for 10 or 20 years. And you are
paranoid. When the fuck did I say I believed I'd bypassed either of
you? I didn't. And what the fuck are you doing Christian? Allying
yourself with a goofball who still hasn't gotten over the formative
years when scatological subjects are still funny. I can hardly agree
that releasing a great game and then 3 other decent ones in a single
year is a sign that I'm slowing down. Who the fuck cares what you
think Mark? As far as I'm concerned you only have one "hit" and that's
Oust. Flume? What the fuck is that? Dots and boxes for people who
can't draw. Hardly a great game by any measure. That's just my opinion
of course, but at least I  present it as such. You produce your shitty
opinion as if it were fact. Fuck you buddy. Your opinion is more
fucked up than most people's anyway. I mean there are a lot of games
that I don't like where I can see their merits but nope, not you.
Where are your new games asshole? Let's say you were 30 today and
you'd just made Tanbo. Where the fuck is your new game? See there you
go. There's the fundamental flaw in your harebrained argument. It
doesn't account for time. It's just a pile 'o' horseshit just like
everything else you type.
The real point though is that design credentials are irrelevant.
Hitler painted a very nice picture that I posted here about a month
ago. He's still an asshole. Just because he created something it
didn't allow him to transcend his humanity. He's still a despicable
human being. I'm hardly equating Mark's actions with Hitler's
atrocities but the point is Mark can create as many games as he wants,
it's not going to make him any less of an asshole.
