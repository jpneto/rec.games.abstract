What are you, the group tattletale, publicly ratting people out for shit
they confided in you privately?

Flume is very similar to, though not isomorphic to, Dots and Boxes.  In both
games, novices don't have a clue, especially in the opening game.  The
novice period for both games is a long one.  There's a big learning curve. 
So, in this respect, Arty is correct.

That being said though, games don't lack clarity.  People lack clarity. 
Dots and Boxes is known for its computational complexity and for its quality
of play among connoisseurs.
Expert Dots and Boxes players laughingly wonder, "What's all this about lack
of clarity?"

Btw, Flume is structurally simpler, yet more computationally complex than
Dots and Boxes.
