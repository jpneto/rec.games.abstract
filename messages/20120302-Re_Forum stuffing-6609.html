Is there any reason you have to launch such a personal attack?
Firstly, the Havannah page on SL was created 8 years ago, and was in a
pretty complete state (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Havannah:v162">http://senseis.xmp.net/?Havannah:v162</a>) 3 years
ago, so this is hardly a new addition of his (and, AFAIK, Havannah has
a sensible albeit small player base - first found about it from a
fellow Go player in Cambridge). I'm always excited about new games and
new ideas coming along, but I'm not going to want to get involved with
spending my time on the promotion of any games authors aren't going to
behave like grown adults.

Forums live and thrive on their interest. If Sygo gains interest, then
the community wants it there - if it doesn't, then it fades of its own
accord. I'll watch this (and the other L19 ones) thread before
deciding how deep my involvement will go. Communities thrive when
people support and encourage each other to delve new depths, not rip
each other's throats out.

Yours,
Graham (topazg)
