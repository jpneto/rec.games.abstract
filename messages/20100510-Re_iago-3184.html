I don't understand why you find it offensive to consider Batik an
abstract game? It seems to me that it is effectively a combinatorial
game (I have only read the rules and I am presuming it is predictable
where the piece will fall). You have perfect information about what
both you and your opponents options will be the entire game. Is your
compaint that pieces do not end up where you expect because it is
difficult/impossible to drop pieces exactly as you want.

Then you do not have perfect information. If you have perfect 
information you know what the position of the board will be after
your move, and all subsequent moves. This clearly isn't abstract, 
this is a game of skill.

There's nothing wrong with highly strategic and tactical physical 
games of skill - I haven't found any game in the universe which 
matches the modern game of tiddlywinks for its depth in every aspect.
But they're not abstract.
