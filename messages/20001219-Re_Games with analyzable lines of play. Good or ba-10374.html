I strongly disagree with you here. Communications in a lossy channel

Well, that's why I don't like it! (I think...what's a "lossy channel", is
that a typo?)  For me, knowing just the rules should be enough to play a
game...that's why it's related to the chess books:  I just want to sit
down and play a game without having to bring a bunch of "baggage". I'm
certainly not saying that that Bridge and Chess are broken or anything.
They are great games and they deserve all the analysis, but they are just
not for me (low attention span, I guess).

But ... you can! I played 'natural' bridge for years as a young teen 
without using more than 2 conventions -- and even then we didn't use them
except for slam hands. I'd probably have been better off <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> playing them.

I will <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very happily<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play a game of bridge with no conventions, especially
with good card players. The conventions are not required to play and enjoy
bridge and, in my opinion, you're better off learning how to play hands
well before learning how to use conventions.

Although I'm not a chess fan, I can say with certainty that there's no way
in hell it will be "dead" in twenty years EVEN IF it is "solved" (which
seems unlikely to me too).  This solution will require so much computing
power that humans will simply not be able to "do" it.

That's probable. But it may be that there is a fairly easily memorizable
strategy that forces a draw. That would change the game a fair bit.
