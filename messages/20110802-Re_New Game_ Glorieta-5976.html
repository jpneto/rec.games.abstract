- A loop is defined as the smallest subset of a chain of stones which
surround at least one cell.
- Players take turns to place stones of their own color (Black or
White) on vacant cells.
- When a loop of stones of any color (Black, White or both) is formed,
the player with more stones in it wins. In case of a tie, the player
completing the loop loses.
- If a play forms two or more equivalent loops, only the one which is
most favorable to the moving player is counted (this is necessary on
square boards, but not on hex ones).

Neat idea! Except I foresee a problem: specifically, that you need to
place only four of your stones in a partial 6-stone loop in order to
ensure a win.  This is so easy to do that the game would either be a)
intensely tactical and entirely focused on such four-stone patterns;
or worse, b) a trivial win for whoever has the first stone on the
board, even with a pie rule.

thoughts?

You could also play it on a square tessellation, with only orthogonal
adjacencies (minimum 8 stones per loop). That change, together with a
territorial goal as in the game I mentioned, may fix it. Let's call it
Vogo 3.0, then. :-)

So now, in Vogo, a player owns a territory when the majority of stones
orthogonally <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>or diagonally<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> adjacent to it are his color. As before,
when the same number of Black and White stones are adjacent to the
territory, the player who did NOT complete the loop claims the
territory it encloses.

(I am having some trouble with google groups lately. Your latest post
only turned visible to me today, and I had sent my previous post four
times before I could see it published. I don't know if it will
continue this way, so sorry if I don't answer immediately.)
