In Japanese rules [for Go], it used to be that there was a rule specifically
saying that a bent four rule was always dead.  Occasionally, someone
would find an obscure position having similar properties to "bent four",
and bring it to the attention of the authorities;  who would consider
it, and eventually make a special ruling on it.  Japanese players seemed
happy enough with this state of affairs, but western players (who
generally used Japanese rules) did not like a rule book that included a
lengthening list of special cases.  In 1982 the Japanese authorities
produced a new rule book, which instead included an algorithm for
establishing whether such special positions were alive or dead.
