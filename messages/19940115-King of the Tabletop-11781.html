Does anyone remember that Tom Wham game, King of the Tabletop,
published in a fairly early (80s?  90s?) issue of the Dragon?
It was a game about land acquisition and conquest, where the object
was to build a Gran Monument, played on an abstract field, the
tabletop.

I lost everything I had concerning the game in a recent move, and was
wondering if anyone could tell me the issue of Dragon it was in, or if
TSR plans to publish it like other early Dragon board games.  Does Tom
Wham still have the rights?  What's he doing anyway?

Thank you.
