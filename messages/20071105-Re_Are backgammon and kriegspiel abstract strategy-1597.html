Just curious here.  The argument is that they are not,
because backgammon involves dice, and kriegspiel has
imperfect information.  So, the question I would have
is: are they or are they not?

They are, because they are abstract, as the pieces do not represent
anything in the real world; they are strategical, as the players have
to think about what they are going to do, planning their moves with
regard to the random future die-rolls and imperfect information; and
they are games.

Thinking and strategy aren't the same thing. Yes, strategy requires
thought, but not all thought is strategy. Personally I think chess
is more tactical than strategic, for example.

But if your definition of strategy is 'anything that requires thought',
then there are a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of strategy games out there. Pretty much any
game that's not pure chance, in fact.
