     Hello, everyone!

      I am glad to see some interest in my Stratego-ish creation.  I've
only tested it five times, due to the long game length, but it seems
balanced in its final form.  As a note on game construction and history,
the defending player has enjoyed a considerable advantage in the
Tournament edition of regular Stratego, and the extra mobility of Set 1
made matters worse!  Sets 2 and 3 were designed to give an attacker enough
power to overwhelm a purely passive defense.  My aim was to create a test
to see who is better at mixing just the right amount of defense while
pouring most of the energy into an attack.  The Shadowflash ability gives
key clues as to the whereabouts of power pieces.  If these become labeled,
they become great targets for ambushes.  Because there are only 4 colors
used for marking the squares, attack combos can be set up based on
uncovering one piece at the same time a second suddenly gains more
mobility.  You must also find the right balance between caution and
paranoia, as threatening to label important pieces and using 7's to
masquerade as power pieces form important strategic elements.  There is no
further need to e-mail me with requests for the rules; that was simply a
test to determine the interest factor.  A rough copy of the rules follows;
these are not copyrighted.  I would be fascinated to hear opinions on
strategy, design mechanics, and anything else you can think of.  I
challenge anyone with sufficient marketing muscle to turn this into a
national product; my guess was that the long play time could hamper
general marketability, but you never know. (All I ask is to have a free
copy!) As for professional production, there shouldn't be a problem with
copyrights, as the only concepts borrowed from Stratego are :  different
ranks and capture rules, a "find the something" goal, and a crossgrid
board with two obstructions.  I personally think a futuristic rendition
would look best, with the flags corresponding to military bases, etc. 
 
        Post comments here, and I'll check on them from time to time. 
        Keep up the interest!
