                        REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION

RFD for creation of rec.games.miniatures group for tabletop miniature
wargamers in any period. Also mailed to Harpoon, Figures, Conflict
Simulation, Squad Leader, Pre-gunpowder, EIA and SFB mailing lists for
distribution to their readership.

REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION

  Create an UNMODERATED Usenet newsgroup called "rec.games.miniatures".

  This announcement is cross-posted to newsgroups and mailing lists whose
  readers may have an interest in the discussion about the new group;
  follow-up discussion will take place in "news.groups".
  Suggestions, comments or problems may also be emailed to me at
  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:bob@werple.apana.org.au">bob@werple.apana.org.au</a>.

PURPOSE

  The newsgroup "rec.games.miniatures" would be a forum for discussing
  the all aspects of the hobby of tabletop miniature wargaming of all
  periods, from figure painting, terrain construction, historical information
  and army and unit composition through to rulesets, tabletop tactics,
  scenarios, campaigning and competitions.

  A "rec.games.miniatures" newsgroup would provide its readers an opportunity
  to discuss their experiences with other hobbyists, sharing skills, ideas,
  information and techniques on topics discussed.

  One major aim of the group is to provide a focus for hobbyists on the net
  to gain assistance from others in finding solutions to specific
  problems, e.g. locating information and sources for a topic or range
  of figures, rules or terrain materials or providing information on a
  new period a player wishes to try out.

RATIONALE

  Much of the miniatures related discussion takes place on a number of
  diverse mailing lists, some of which are published in edited, digest form.
  As many miniatures gamers play more than one period, this requires
  subscription to multiple mailing lists. As lists are not widely
  publicised, relevant discussion can be easily missed. As list
  subscriptions are small compared to newsgroup readership, It is likely
  that many potential tabletop miniature readers may be missing out on
  participating in discussion as no central forum exists.

  As has been the case with other newsgroups, which had their basis in
  mailing lists, signing up formally to a list and then sending mail to
  publish an article takes a commitment of time. Some sites place
  restrictions on mailing list subscription.   Because participation in
  a newsgroup is easy, immediate, and spontaneous, it is hoped this will
  encourage and facilitate a greater amount of information and skill sharing
  among players of tabletop miniature wargames.
