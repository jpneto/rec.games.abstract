 &gt;&gt;I wanted to try to make a go board that's like a globe, i.e. no corners
 &gt;&gt;at all, but unfortunately has no expertise to do so. Anyone any ideas? I
 &gt;&gt;feel it would really open up the game ;-)
 &gt;&gt;Just imagine 2 players facing each other in front of a ball with
 &gt;&gt;intersections engraved on the longitudes and latitudes. We'll still keep
 &gt;&gt;the 4 liberty to one spot configuration... I think it would be
 &gt;&gt;interesting.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;Any comp graphic wiz can conjure up such a board? Might be worth a try,
 &gt;&gt;anyone else game for it?

 &gt;A problem is too keep the regular symmetric structure that the go board has.  You
 &gt;can't do this if you put squares on the sphere.  You could do it if you made an
 &gt;icosohedron (20 sided figure made of triangles) or dodechaderon (12 sides, with
 &gt;pentagons). But then the number of neighbors changes, too.

Go has been tried on many different board shapes and topologies.  The
orthogonal grid turns out to be one of the best (which may be somewhat
surprising to the unbiased observer).

You might be interested in torical Go, where the opposite board edges are
considered to be connected.  Playing on a torus means that all opening
moves are effectively equivalent.  However, this game is considered to be
quite inferior to the standard game with edges and corners.  Another
interesting option is to play on asymmetric and even random boards.

For these irregular boards, a very good game to play is "One-Capture Go".
The rule for this game is that the first player to capture an enemy stone
wins the game.  This new goal actually doesn't change the strategy of the
game too much, since the player with the most territory will generally be
the first to capture a group.  Since stones are never removed (until the
game is over), One-Capture Go can be conveniently played on paper grids
using two colours of pens.  Each player takes turns colouring in a space
(the game is played in the spaces, not on the intersections), and a wide
variety of interesting boards are possible.

One-Capture Go is discussed at length in the book "New Rules for Classic
Games", and several interesting board shapes are described.  The book's
author is also the game's inventor.  I can't remember his name exactly,
but it is something like Wayne Schmittenberger (sorry if I butchered it).
By the way, the book covers a lot of ground, and is highly recommended
for those who like varying and improving the rules of classic games.
