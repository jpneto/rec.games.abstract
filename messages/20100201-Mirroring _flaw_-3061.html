Some of my games, including, I suspect, Flume, can be won by player 1 if he
claims the center cell of the board and mirrors player 2.  The pie rule
makes this "flaw" a total non-issue and I don't think I'm going to worry
about it.

Back when I released Lariat, some clown posted an "Oh my God Lariat is
flawed!!" message, and I kind of went along with it at the time.  Now
looking back though, I think I bought into some bullshit from someone who
couldn't design a hole in the ground.  A lot of otherwise robust games have
said "flaw" and I don't see anyone complaining about them.
