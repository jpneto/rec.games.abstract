Hi,

i'm writing my own version of the peg solitaire game.
The problem is that my program run too slow. On configurations with 32
pegs, the
programs can run even for 30 mins.

I use simple brute force, with a cache that store invalid
configurations (those that cannot
be reduced to only one peg).
I order the edges of the search space with a function that try to
minimize the covered area
and the "dispersion" of the board.
This function work better if i use the look-ahead technique.
But if the move at deep 10 is wrong, than the program simply have to
consider too much configurations.

I don't have access to two of the most important books on the subject,
so i really don't know how to go on.

I know, for example, that there are some necessary conditions called
"pagoda functions". Can someone explain me how to use and generate
this functions? Can i use a pagoda function with an arbitrary
configuration
of pegs?

Thanks,
Lucas
