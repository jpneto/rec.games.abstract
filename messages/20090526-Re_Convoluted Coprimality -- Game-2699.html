Here is a game for any plural number of players.

Start by drawing an n-by-n grid on paper, where I suggest that n is &gt;=
12.

Players take turns, going in a predetermined order (such as clockwise
by how the players are seated).
The game starts when Player 1 places a 1 in the upper-left square of
the grid.
Player 1 then places a 2 either in the square immediately to the right
of the 1 or in the square immediately below the 1.
Then it is player 2's turn.

A "turn" is made up of a series of "moves". Only one player makes his/
her moves during a single turn.

On the kth "turn", a player (whose turn it is to move) writes the
numbers &gt; than the (k-1)th prime and &lt;= the kth prime in empty squares
as follows:

On the kth turn, the integer j starts as (the {k-1}th prime)+1. The
player continues moving until j equals the kth prime.
On the jth  "move", a player places the number j in an empty square
either immediately above, right of, below, or left of the square with
a (j-1) in it. (The {k-1}th prime would have been placed in a square
by the previous player to move.)
A number must be placed in a square bordered (above, right of, left
of, below) by 2 or more squares that have already been filled in with
numbers previously (filled in with numbers by any player). (So, the
empty square to have the number j placed in it must be next to the
square with the number (j-1) in it, plus the number j must be next to
ONE OTHER square, at least, with a number already in it.)

BUT, if the square being filled in is in a row or column that is on
the border of the grid, then the number j need only be next to ONE
square that is already filled in (which is the square with the (j-1)).

When a player is forced to -- or does so by accident -- place an
integer j in a square that is immediately next to (in the direction of
above, below, right of, or left of) a square with a number that is NOT
coprime to j, then that player is eliminated from competition.

Play continues until there is one player left, who is the winner.

If, during play, there are no empty squares where numbers can be
placed, then the remaining players start again on a new empty grid,
and j = 1 and k = 1 again.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

I should explain the name of this game. It derives from the fact that
the "path" formed by connecting the integers in order winds around a
lot, at least it did when I experimented with this game during its
development.
Also, I honestly can't think of a better name that isn't already in
use for one of my other games.
Thanks,
