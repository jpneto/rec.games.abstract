I think you've got a good framework for replacing balancing mechanisms in a lot of abstracts, and the fact that the first player would have the right to this "half move" is very intriguing.

I created Shintai to solve what Connect6 circumvented - a more elegant balance for Gomoku. While I love the concept I had, this idea might be even better, with the special move being "move one of your pieces to any unoccupied point on the board." Black is encouraged to give up material advantage (while still making a decent play) at a certain point because white can make threats that are significantly smaller, or simply play a highly defensive early game. White would also be unable to simply take the material advantage early in the game.

I'd like so see what a similar concept would do in Hex, also. GREAT stuff.
