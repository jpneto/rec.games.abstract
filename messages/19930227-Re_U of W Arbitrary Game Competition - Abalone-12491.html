Hello Canada,

After downloading your posting and reading the rules a little better,
I have some more questions.
But first, a remark for those who have a Macintosh and did not read my
earlier posting: read it, there is a source code offer in it.
And now my questions:

Q: Why the KO rule? I have the original board version of Abalone,
and there is no such rule in the board version of the game.
If it has been added to avoid endless repetitions, what's the problem?
It's up to the programmer to put some randomnesss in his program
if he wants to avoid draws this way. When neihter of the programs
does anything to avoid endless repetitions, it's a fair draw, isn't it?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The problem is that most humans will not repeat a board position too often
since they will eventually get bored and do something different. Unfortunately,
with infinite patience, a computer will continue to play the same position
over and over and over and ...

Note that most games that people play do have some sort of "ko" or progress
rule to force players to not endlessly play (ie. to make an infinite game
finite). Go has the Ko and Super-Ko rules (in essence, no repeating a board
position), while chess has the "at most 3 repetitions of a board" and
"no nore than 50(?) moves between pawn movement or captures".

Q: What about the maximum # of moves: does white lose at move 201,
or is it a draw? (I think a draw would be the most fairest rule)

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Essentially whoever is ahead wins. I do realize that a program could
push off a single marble and then play defensively till all the moves
are used up.

This was a compromise we made in order to allow a tournament to run in
a day. Without some sort of upper limit on the number of moves, we would
have to go to a chess-like tournament timing which is essentially "move x
moves by the end of the first t hours, then there must be y moves
every hour after that". This could mean a game that would take the entire
day to play.

Once again, the problem is that humans get impatient and will try to
force a game to move along (even at an increase risk to themselves),
while computers can play very defensive games.
