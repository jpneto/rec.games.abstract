The rules and the history of renju and other five-in-a-row games

Earlier this month I wrote in newsgroup rec.games.board and informed a little 
about renju and also about pente. A lot of persons wrote to me asking about these 
games. Then I decided to wrote more deeply about the games. Here is my 
information. I am sending it to the newsgroups rec.games.abstract  
rec.games.board rec.games.go  rec.games.chess  because my experience tells me 
that  go- and chessplayers sometimes are also playing renju or other five-in-a-row-
games and probably most of my writing are unknown for them.

The rules and history of renju

The two basic "completely free" rules of all five-in-a-row games are:

Rule 1. Play alternates between one player who starts the game (in Renju 
called Black because he is playing with  black stones on the intersections of a  
board with fifteen vertical and fifteen horizontal lines) and another player 
(usually called White because he is playing with white stones). The renju-
board has the limits 15x15 intersections but long ago the board had the same 
size as the Go-board i.e. it had 19x19 intersections. It is also possible to play 
writing crosses and circles in the squares of  a piece of paper (usually a paper 
made for mathematical calculations) and then the ground to play on has no 
special limits because it is possible to add a new paper to the first and make 
the ground infinite as was usual in Sweden when we did not know about 
serious playing. Of course it is only possible to put the mark or the stone on 
an empty  place.

Rule 2. The first player to get an unbroken line of five stones (marks) 
whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins the game. 

In Japan they played with these rules on a 19x19 Go-board  since many years and 
maybe since about 700 A.D. when  Go was introduced in Japan from China. The 
game was often called Go-moku but aother names are known for example gobang, 
morphion. However the game had also other names in Japan. Scientist in Japan are 
discussing if the very old game kakugo mentioned  in a writing from the year 100 
A.D. is a five-in-a-row game. When the first book on our game was published in 
the year of 1858 A.D. the game was called kakugo. The ancient Chinese game of 
WUTZU is also considered to be the prototype of  the Five-In-A-Row games. 
However I think and also other players that the rules are so simple that it is 
possible that people from different parts of the world may have discovered the 
game without knowing each other and maybe on other planets of Universe they 
are also playing the game  with the rules 1-2 above. As a matter of fact it is 
difficult to find many other games that probably are played on other planets. I 
doubt if I think of chess or Go and probably they do not play Renju exactly as we 
do either.

When the players got stronger they found that playing with the above mentioned 
"completely free" rules was in great favour of Black (the beginner of the game). It 
is also proved  that there is a sure win for Black when playing with "completely 
free" rules. In the book Five-In-A-Row/Renju mentioned below you will find a lot 
of games proving the sure win. However I have more games proving when there 
are lacks in this book so I can show you if you  have any doubts about the sure 
win. I have also seen what is called to be a mathematical proof. However I have 
not studied  this proof  very much myself. In the year of 1899 the Japanese players 
began to play more organized and  this year they also changed the name for 
serious playing from Go-Moku to Renju  which means five pearls in a row. 
However, the game Go-Moku has become even more known than Renju for the 
Five-In-A-Row game played in families and in schools. 1899 they tried to play 
with forbidden double-threes
for both players to make it more difficult to win. To make a double-three is to 
make two threes with the same move.       OO  A        OOOB        OOOCOO       
X  OOD  X                      E          OOGO
                                 O               O                                             O                       
OO                O
                                 O           O                                                 O                  
OFOOX             O
                                            O                                                                         O

In the figures above Black is always O  and White is always X. I hope it is possible 
to make figures this way and that the figures will not be changed transforming this 
information.

To play in A is to make a double-three. It is in principal impossible to stop it if the 
opponent only has to defend himself. Playing with forbidden double-threes for 
both players is  still the only additional rule that is usual for family games of 
Gomo-ku in Japan. However in the year of 1903 the rule that only Black had 
restrictions was adopted i.e. only for Black the double-three became not allowed. 
.
In 1912 it was decided that Black will immediately lose if he makes a double-
three, even if it is as a defence. 
In 1916 the rule that Black will lose the game if he makes an overline i.e. a row 
with more than five stones.
Usually an overline consists of 6 stones in a row. To play in C is to make an 
overline.
1918 it was decided that Black could not make a 4-3-3 i.e. a four and with the 
same move a double-three.
However making exactly five-in-a-row is never forbidden i.e. 5-3-3 is allowed 
even if there were suggestions to adopt such a rule especially about 1918.

In the fast half of our century one great player where appointed Meijin for lifetime  
(Now the Meijin of Japan is the player who wins the yearly final match including 5 
games and with the time limit 5 hours/player and game.) The 1st  permanent  
meijin  was Takayama Goraku.The 3rd  permanent meijin Takagi Rakazan was 
also  a very good Go-player and his dream was to spread Renju outside Japan 
(You can read about him in the famous book of Nobel prize winner Yasunari 
Kawabata ." The Master of Go" , Penguin Modern Classics, pages 31,33,78). He 
proposed two new rules. 1931 he proposed the change from Go-board with 19x19 
intersections to Renju-board with only 15x15 intersections. He also proposed a 
double-four to be forbidden for Black. These suggestions were discussed for many 
years and  a split into several organizations using different rules occured. The 
purpose of all suggestions to changes was  of course to reach equal winning 
chances for both Black and White.

In 1966 all the main organizations joined and created Nihon Renju Sha which is 
still the Renju Federation of Japan. At that time also some opening rules were 
decided. Takagi Rakuzan

Summary: Besides the first 2 mentioned rules the following rules are used in Renju

Rule 3. Black is prohibited  from making a double three, a double four and 
an overline. If  Black makes one of these patterns either accidentally or by 
being forced to, he loses the game.

Rule 4. White is not subject to any restrictions and may make double threes, 
double fours, and overllines, an overline having the same value for him as a 
five.

Rule 5. If neither player has succeeded in making a row of five stones when 
the board has been played out, the game is called a draw. It is also possible 
to agree on draw.

Observe that the double-three is counted as a  forbidden double three only if 
it is in principal  not possible to stop for the opponent who has nothing to 
attack with and who is only playing defensive. For example if there is only 
space for 5 stones in a line because of playing in a corner it is not necessary 
to stop a three on this line. The opponent is able to stop the other three and 
black cannot win with the three limited within 5 intersections. A move in D 
is not making a double-three because if the vertical three will be stopped it is 
not possible to win making the horizontal three to a four. A move in E is not 
a double three because if the vertical three will be stopped it is not possible 
to win making a move in F because making a move in F is making a  double-
four which  is not allowed.

Now your questions probably are: How is it possible for Black to win with all 
these restrictions. As a matter of fact there is still a sure win for Black and Black 
can always win making a four-three. A move in  G is a winning move for Black. 
Because of this in renju we have also opening rules.

Opening rules:

Rule 6. In starting the game, a tentative Black, and subsequently a tentative 
White, are decided between each other.

Rule 7. The tentative Black plays the 1st move on the center intersection.

Rule 8. The tentative White plays the 2nd move direct or indirect at his 
option. "Direct" means a  move made horizontal or vertical to the 1st move 
and in direct connection with the 1st move. "Indirect" means a move made 
diagonal to the 1st move and in direct connection with the 1st move.

Rule 9. The tentative Black plays the 3rd move on an empty place within a 
zone of 5x5 intersection with the same center as the center intersection of the 
whole board.

Rule 10. Seeing move 3, the tentative White has the right to change sides. If 
he prefers Black, he changes sides, gives white stones to his opponent, and 
receives black stones. If, however, he prefers to continue the game with white 
stones, nothing happens and he simply plays the 4th move.  

Rule 11. White is free to play the 4th move wherever he wants.

Rule 12. Black's Choice. Black has to offer his opponent two possible moves 
(he deems promising for himself). The two moves must  be equal in all 
respects if you look to the situation in the center of the board. From the two 
alternatives Black has provided, White tries to evaluate which of the two will 
be more advantageous to himself and tells Black to make the move he 
(White) prefers.

Rule 13. There are no restrictions on the sixth and later moves.

The rules 1-13 are the renju rules of the Renju International Federation 
(RIF).

Supplemental rules:  In  "The international rules of renju" , the offical rules 
of Renju International Federation there are also  for example rules for 
recording of the game, use of clock , late arival, the behaviour of the players, 
organizer of  a competition. Rules for time limit and tiebreaking rules differs 
because of the situation for each special tournament. Later I hope to offer 
the official rules of  Renju International Federation at ftp.pi.se.

At ftp.pi.se choosing pub/pc/games/renju in the future you will find files 
interesting for all five-in-a-row players.

With the sofisticated rules 1-13, the situation automatically will be even for both 
players if they want to and if they want to play more strategic and if some of the 
players want to he can make the situation in advantage for his opponent because 
he wants to play more with tactics and  he hopes to lead his opponent into a very 
complicated situation where the opponent will make som mistake.

When you are a beginner you do not need all these rules. You can play with rules 
1-2 for a long time without realizing that Black has a sure win. In my club in 
J�nk�ping, Sweden we always let the beginners play with only rule 1-2 and when 
they play with the experienced renjuplayers they will always start the game i.e. 
play with the black stones. After some time when they have become better players 
they will begin to win also against experienced players and now it is time for them 
to play with the complete rules. We are always playing with chess clocks and  if 
we are playing blitz games for the beginners we use the following time rules: Two 
games are played in each match. The beginner has 5 minutes a game and the 
experienced players have 30  seconds in the 1st game and  15 seconds in the 2nd 
game. The experienced player must win both games to win the match. Otherwise 
the beginner is the winner of the match.

On the 2nd of February 1958 the Swedish Association "Svenska 
Luffarschackf�rbundet" was founded. From 1961 this association has arranged 
Swedish Championship and from 1961 till 1980 the rules were the completely free 
rules 1-2 and the games were played with crosses and circles on a piece of paper. 
In the beginning of January 1975 for the first time I met Alf Dahlgren who 
organized competitions in southern Sweden without knowledge about the Swedish 
Association. I had played the game before but nerver in any organized form. Alf 
Dahlgren inspired me to play more seriously. In november Alf Dahlgren met the 
chairman of the Swedish Association, Bertil Bokelius. and Dahlgren's playing 
friends joined the Swedish Association. I played for the 1st time in Swedish 
Championship 1988. 

In May 1978 the first international match between Sweden and Denmark took 
place. The danish player Torben Zahle informed Alf Dalgren about the existence 
of the game in Japan. I made some tries to reach the Japanese players and finally I 
succeeded through a Swedish Go-player who gave me the address to Mr Bozulich 
at Ishi Press (the Go books publishing firm). Mr Bozulich gave me the address to 
Nihon Renju Sha. 

In august 1977 Mr Valdimir Sapronov from Russia visited Osaka in Japan. During 
his visit he met Mr  Kosho Hayakawa in Kyoto. After coming home to Russia Mr 
Sapronov wrote in a Russian newspaper about Renju and three University students 
answered and together these four player introduced renju in former Soviet Union.

The three university students were Alexander Nosovsky (Now he is the chief-
editor of Renju World - The International Magazine of Renju International 
Federation), Nikolai Alexandrov (Now he is living in USA and recently he 
informed in  some of the Internet Newsgroup about "The First North American 
Open Renju Championship by e-mail") and Slava Bruver.

In December 1982  for the 1st time Japanese players visited Sweden and 
participated in the tournament "Swedish Open International Championship of 
Renju". In 1983 I was the first Swedish player to visit Japan.

In the summer 1985 two Swedish players Peter Jonsson and Jan Palmgren took 
part in a renju tournament in Moscow. 

On the 8th of August 1988  in Stockholm, Sweden The Renju International 
Federation (RIF) was created. The 1st World Championship of Renju took place 
in Kyoto, Japan 1989. The second World Championship was organized in 
Moscow 1991 and the third World Championship was played in Arjeplog, in the 
north of Sweden 1993. In August 1995 the 4th World Championship will take 
place in Tallinn, Estonia. The winner of the !st and 2nd World Championship was 
Shigeru Nakamura from Tokyo, Japan. The winner of the 3rd World 
Championship was Ando Meritee from  Tallinn, Estonia. Many other international 
tournaments have been organized since the start of  RIF. The latest is the 1st 
European Championship with the winner  Arnis Veidemanis from Riga, Latvia. 

By now RIF has nine full members. It is Japan, Russia, Sweden, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Estonia, France, Latvia and White Russia. The following countries 
have connection men but are not yet full members: Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, 
Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Italy,  Moldova,  Mongolia, Netherlands, 
Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Taiwan, Ukraine, USA(Will probably soon 
be a member as " North American Renju Federation"), Uzbekistan and Vietnam. If 
you are interested to be a member of  RIF or a connection man or if you want the 
address to your connection man in your country, please, write to me.

Other rules

A lot of new players often have their own opinion of the rules of renju. Some 
players are more interested in the rules and how they could be changed than to 
play the game. As I wrote above discussions about the rules belong to the history 
of Japan. Many organizations and players have had their own opinions and some 
groups have been created with other rules than the official  renju rules. Vladimir 
Sapronov in Moscow suggested different as he thought easier rules and his rules 
got the international name "Five-In-A-Row". There are players in Russia and in 
Sweden playing with these rules. However,  some of these players often also take 
part in ordinary renju competitions. These rules from the beginning were ment to 
be easier to introduce to beginners but at the same time enough to get equal 
chances to win for both black and white. However if you start to analyze using 
these rules you cannot usually use your analyzes playing renju. The rules are

a. Rule 1-2 above using a renju-board of 15x15 intersections.
b. Black starts in the center intersection.
c. The 2nd move i.e. the 1st move for White can be put anywhere.
d. the 3rd move Black must make outside the zone of 5x5 intersections with the 
same center as the center of the whole board.The 5x5 zone is a prohibited zone.
e. No overline counts as a victory for either opponents but no overline constitutes 
a fault (i.e. an overline means nothing)
f. Double-threes and double-fours are allowed for both players

These rules seems simple and enough to get an equal game and Vladimir Sapronov 
thought so. However, after using these rules in tournaments some years most 
players agreed that these rules are not enough. To get equal rules to these rules 
also must be put additional rules. Now  players in Russia are testing to play  with 
the following additional rules:
g. Black's Choice (rule 12) are used both for the 5th and the 7th move for Black.

Now I really put the question if the rules a-g are  much easier than the renju rules 
1-13. My opinion is that the Renju rules 1-13 is  enough and  all the best players of 
many countries are satisfied with these rules. All rules have their history also in 
other sports. If you want to start from the beginning and create perfect rules you 
have to offer many years playing with the best players in the world testing your 
ideas before you know if the rules are enough to get an equal game for Black and 
White. With the renjurules  1-13 all these experiment are already made by the best 
players in the world during all this century. I prefer to play with these rules that a 
big majority of the players of the world like. At all events the rules of renju are 
very easy if you compare with for example many computer games. For an 
enthusiast of the free rules1-2 seeing the renju rules the first time they seem 
extensive  but after playing only a few games they will often change their mind.

Other Five-In-A-Row Games

If you are a good player using rules 1-2 above or 1-13 or a-f or a-g  you are in 
principal  a strong player also in the other variations. However it is possible to add 
such rules to rules 1-2 above so that the good renju-player meets quite a new 
game. Such a game is Pente. Pente is a registered game owned by Parker Brothers 
and the Swedish Association has got the permission  from PlayMix AB (The 
Swedish distributor of the game) to write about it. 

The main rules of Pente

A. There are two ways to win the game:
	1. Win by getting five-(or more)-in-a-row, either horizontally, 
	vertically, or diagonally, with no empty points between the stones, or
	2. Win by capturing five (or more) pairs of your opponents stones.
B. Playing begins in the centre of the board and the same rule as d) above is used 
for the 3rd move.
C. Whenever your opponent has two stones (and only two) which are adjacent, 
those stones are vulnerable to capture. The pair can be captured by bracketing its 
two ends with your own stones.
D. A stone may legally be played onto any empty intersection, even if that point 
has been previously occupied, and even if it forms a pair between two enemy 
stones. No capture is made by the enemy in that case.
E. Multiple captures are legal.
F. A Pente-board has 19 vertical and 19 horizontal lines like the Go-board.
G. White starts the game (which differs from Renju and Go).

Pente was introduced by Gary Gabrel from Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA in the end 
of the nineteen seventies and Pente became very popular in the USA in the first 
half of nineteen eighties  and in  the USA also World Championships were 
arranged, but as I know with participants only from USA. We also arranged for 
five years Swedish Championships. I won two times. I do not know about the 
popularity in USA by now. In Sweden we have a few players but very little or 
almost none serious competitions. Maybe we will arrange Swedish Championship 
again if  there will be enough interested players. Among the best players of Pente 
in the USA there were discussions whether the rules of Pente are enough to get 
equal chances for White and Black. The World Champion Rollie Tash thought that 
White had a sure win and proposed a change of the rules. He proposed either 
Keryo-Pente or taking up some of the rules of renju into pente. 

Some books on Pente were written by Tom Braunlich, former World Champion. I 
also made a compendium on openings and about other literature on Pente in 
Swedish. In this compendium I also introduce more than 10 funny variantions of 
five-in-a-row games. In 1987 it was meant to found a World Association but of 
some reasons this association was never founded. I wrote the International Rules 
of Pente for this association. These rules were never adopted but the work of 
constructing them is done. If  several people are interested I can publish them.

Rules of Keryo-Pente

Keryo Pente uses the same rules as regular Pente, except that

h. 3-in-a-row may also be captured in addition to regular pair captures.
j.  To win one must get either 5-in-a-row or capture 15 stones.

Ninuki-Renju

Pente is similar to a game that in Japan has the name "Ninuki-Renju" or "Chosen 
(Korean) Gomoku"(but as I have heard this game is not from Korea). This game 
has the same rules as Pente (except from the opening rule which probably not is 
used). However in Ninuki-Renju some other additional rules are used. The game 
of Ninuki-Renju had its own organization Ninuki Renju Sha in Japan  1923-1940 
but as far as we know  by now this game has no association in Japan  so the rules 
may differ from family to family. The additional rules of Ninuki-Renju are:

H. The first to form a "perfect 5" or capture five pairs is the winner.
I.Black starts as in Renju. If a five is made and after that White  takes a capture 
and destroys the five there is no win. This is called an "unperfect 5". However the 
destroying of the unperfect five must be made with the move immediately 
following the five.
J. The first player (or sometimes both players) is not allowed to form a double-
three, unless it is necessary to do so when destroying an "unperfect 5".
K. An "overline" (six or more stones in a row) does not win and remains neutral 
(the same rule as e above).
L. A rare case occurs when a fifth capture gives the opponent a five. This occurs 
when one stone is captured away from a 6-in-a-row, thus leaving 5. In this case, 
the game is draw.

Ninuki-Renju is mentioned at pages 50,78,85 in the before mentioned book  "The 
Mater of Go"  by Yasunari Kawabata.
 
Funny variations

Sometimes you are not in the mood for playing  a serious game. Then I know a lot 
of variations of the five-in-a-row games. I cannot write about all of them here but 
some variations I want to mention. None of the games have fixed rules. The rules 
are in the idea-phase where all consequences not are calculated. As a matter of 
fact regarding all the games mentioned in this article only renju has mature rules 
with one century's experience.The first four games mentioned below I was 
introduced to by Nickolaj Alexandrov, Alexander Nosovsky and Sergey 
Zanchenko in Leningrad 1987. Usually rule 1-2  or pente is enough as a ground  
for the additional rules mentioned even if the game has the name renju within the 
name of the game.

Anti-renju

This game was introduced by Sergey Zanchenko from Moscow. In this game you 
can use only the rules 1-2 with the following additional rule: An open four, i.e. a 
four which is not stopped by the opponent in either end is forbidden. It means that 
a three is not so dangerous as usual. The first time you play  you will find it 
difficult ever to win. It is possible also to play Anti-Pente i.e. forbidden open four 
in combination with usual Pente rules. If in Anti-Pente the fifth capture gives 
yourself an open four the game is draw. 

Renju with a common center stone

In this game the center stone is black when it is black's move and  white when it is 
white's  move. Black starts the game in the center of the board.

Renju with atomic bomb

Once in a game each player has the right to drop an  atomic bomb instead of a 
usual move. After dropping the bomb this bomb-stone is left on the board but all 
other black and white  to the bomb adjacent stones  diagonally, horizontally or 
vertically must be taken away from the board. Pente with atomic bomb is also 
possible to play.

Repensi

This game is a combination of renju, pente and reversi.  Instead of  capturing two 
stones these stones are changing colour as in reversi.  

Neutral stone

This is a funny  variation of pente. Each player has two neutral stones in a third 
colour. Each player has the right to use the neutral stone for a move instead of the 
ordinary stones for this player. The neutral stone is not possible to capture by 
neither black nor white.

Combinations of the above mentioned funny games may be possible. I like best 
Anti-Renju or Anti-Pente and  Renju or Pente with atomic bomb seems 
interesting. As I said before there are a lot of  more variations published and to 
find by yourself. However if you want to play seriously in a game with traditions 
where there are really strong players and where there are a lot of levels to reach 
before you can fully understand how the best players play renju is of course the 
only five-in-a-row game.

Problems competition 

It is possible to order from me a problems competition. If you succeed you will 
receive a dan- or kyu-degree of renju just as in other Japanese sports. However, 
the competition are under construction so maybe you have to wait some time if 
you order immediately.

Web page

In a few weeks Renju International  Federation will get its own Web homepage. 
How you will find it I will inform in Renju Newsletter and in rec.games.abstract. If 
you find anything in this printing wrong even if it is only bad English I am glad if 
you want to inform me via e-mail. As I can understand the best newsgroup for 
renju is rec.games.abstract If you want to discuss this printing maybe this is the 
best group to write to. But, should renju and other five-in-a-row games have its 
own newsgroup named rec.games.abstract.renju . What is your opinion?  After 
some weeks I will eventually correct this information and put it as r1rulhis.zip at 
ftp.pi.se directories pub/pc/games/renju where all other important information on 
renju also will be put in the future.

Friendly Yours,
