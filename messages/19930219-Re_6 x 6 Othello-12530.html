Currently, the limit of (overnight by a PC) Othello perfect-play
analysis is within the range of the last 26-28 moves of the game.
The 6 x 6 game has only 32 moves (31 actually since the first move
is determined WRT symmetry) and each player has fewer options to
consider per move (as compared to an 8 x 8 game).  So SURELY the
6 x 6 game has ALREADY been solved...

  Some other interesting and solvable variations on Othello are:
    1) 4x4 Othello
    2) 'Reverse' othello - player with the fewest disks at the end of
	the game wins. This could be a viable 4x4 or 6x6 game
    3) A variation on othello where the 'flipping' rule is changed.
       Instead of just flipping pieces between the just-played piece
       and similarly colored pieces, also flip any other pieces that
       are between similarly colored pieces as a result of the first
       series of flips.
    4) This just popped into my head as I'm typing - but what about
       a semi-Othello-like game where 1) Players can place pieces
       anywhere, and 2) A newly placed piece flips all of the existing
       pieces in the same row or column (regardless of color). Hmmmm,
       I'll have to get out my board and see if it's viable.

  Also, a general question for the group:

  I have a semi-general minimax program that I use (sometimes) to analyze
  games that I have an interest in. It occurs to me that other people have
  this as well, and if they do, that their programs are probably better
  written than mine. This could be useful information to exchange for those
  who are unable to run Barney Pell's (hope I got the name right!) Metagame
  workbench.
