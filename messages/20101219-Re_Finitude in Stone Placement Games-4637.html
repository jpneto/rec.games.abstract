How do you guarantee that the game will end?  Well, the simplest way is not
to have capturing and just let the board fill up.  This impacts robustness
though.   On an odd sized grid, Black will have the first move, the last
move, and altogether one more move than White.  All of this will either be
an advantage or a disadvantage to Black, but not neither.

I've got some thoughts on this, the first being that the post isn't
titled "Finitude in MS stone placement games", so I think you're
cutting some corners here ;-)

But I'm in the groove again (finally) of a book I'm co-writing, on the
history and evolution of draughts variants, after being caught up in
lethargy for two month, in games inventing for two month and in let's
say communicating for two month.
So I'll get back to this later.

Meanwhile I'm interested in your concept of "robustness" - is it
linked only to the first/second move advantage or do other factors
play a role? Is Hex not robust because it needs a meta rule to balance
it?

Concerning meta-rules, I consider a swap not essential in for the
subject matter, but 3-fold essentially not. 3-fold is a means to
remedy the 'horror' we're discussing, a band aid for non-finite games
essentially, so it should not be part of the discussion in the first
place.

So you add capturing to your design, lots of capturing.

I think you're jumping the gun here, but as said, the horrendously
infinite draughts variants are calling ;-)
