 Granted. But this was not my conjecture. I'm claiming that an equal 
position is MORE LIKELY to lead to a draw than an unequal position. 

 Ergo, more equal positions=more draws. (I didn't say that a more equal 
position would result in only draws, now, did I?)

(Arguement attacking a staw-man arguement I never made snipped).

I don't follow what the incentive would be for players to "settle on a few
positions." Most strong players would rather win games than draw them.
There are over 10 thousand positions the first player could create with
3MEQ.

 Yeah. But there are 20 moves that a player can make with his first move 
in standard chess, but in practice we see 4 of them the overwhelmingly 
vast majority of the time, and 2 or 3 others make up the overwhelmingly 
vast majority of the exceptions.

 With 3MEQ, you can talk about 10 thousand theoretical positions, but 
the truth is you instantly throw out ALL of them where there is an 
obvious advantage, however slight, for either side. That's going to 
whittle the number down pretty quickly. 

 Furthermore, chess at a high level has never been about traps, so it 
seems likely that the trappy variations you hypothesize would only be an 
issue among weak amateurs, who, honestly, make enough mistakes that the 
advantage of the first move means less.
