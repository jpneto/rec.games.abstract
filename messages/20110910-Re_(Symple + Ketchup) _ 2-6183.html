You can always play it with the Ketchup and Byg goal, but maybe that's
too similar to Ketchup (not sure if better or worse, though).

There is a choice between two tie-breakes here: first passer wins and
the Ketchup tie-breaker.

In the rules above, I suggested that passing is allowed and the player
who passed first wins. This makes for tricky endgames with some
interesting tactical decisions to make, and determining a winner
requires less counting than the Ketchup tie-breaker. A nice example:

  . . .
 o o o o
x x o o o
 x x x x
  x . .

Black to play and win. The winning move is a pass.

I also remember reading that the Ketchup tie-breaker can produce some
zugzwang positions. With passing allowed, this is not an issue. On the
other hand, the Ketchup tie-breaker is more strategical, increases a
little the depth of the game and the winner is determined strictly
from the board state. But Nick said: "I prefer win conditions which
are simple enough and visual enough that you know who won by glancing
at the board, without calculation," which is not the case with the
Ketchup tie-breaker.

In any case, the main question is whether zugzwuang is a problem or
not. I can imagine an elemental tied position (both in Ketchup and the
game we're discussing now) with 5 empty spaces between both players'
largest groups, which are the same size. If the rest of the board is
occupied, whoever plays (two stones) first loses. With the tie-breaker
I suggested, the first player to move wins, again, by passing. In my
opinion, as a rule of thumb, a game with cold elements should allow
passing whenever possible.

Another posibility is to combine both tie-breakers.
