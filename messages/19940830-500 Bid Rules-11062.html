Does anyone have a FAQ or set of rules to 500 BID?  The reason I ask is that
I recently bought a card game rule book.  The rules for 500 BID in it where
somewhat different than what I have played.  For instance, there was no
'inkle' and the widow specified was three cards, while I've played with both
three and five card widows.  I always played that 7 was the minimum bid, while
in the book, they had a bids starting at 6.  I didn't see any optional rules
that would explain these discrepancies.  Anyone know if 'inkling' and five
card widows are optional rules or just things that people either intentionally
or mistakenly added?  Thanks.
