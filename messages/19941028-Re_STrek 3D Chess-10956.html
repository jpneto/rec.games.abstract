There is a beautiful 3d chess set on the market called "hyper-chess" or
something like that.  The board design and rules were very carefully
thought out.  Very playable.  The only thing that keeps me from buying
it is the $175.00 price tag.

I have the rules for what I think this "hyperchess" is, and yes, the game
set I've seen for this costs at least $200.  I've built my own out of 
hardwoods (easy project, it's geometrically very simple) and have enjoyed
the strategy of the game immensely.  Here is a synopsis of the game.  If 
anybody would like a copy of the entire rule set (which has more than enough
info to let you build your own; cost $30 or less as a project), just send
me a SASE at

and I'll send you a xerox copy of them.  I think the game is great, and would
love to see more people playing it.

LOGITAC

Several versions of LOGITAC use the same game principal: the manoeuvre of
pawns and pieces on several boards the surface of which becomes
smaller and smaller, thus giving, through simple movement rules, many
more possibilities than all known strategic games [note: this is
false, i'm just copying the lierature; GO is much more combinatorially
complex, but hey!].  In addition, some of the squares on these boards
are subject to special provisions, hence a multiplication of the
number of possible moves.


The LOGITAC basic model is a three-dimensional game consisting of four
boards located over one another as a pyramid with a square base.

In another version, boards are placed as a staircase.

The third version which is nearer to conventional games because of its
configuration presents all the boards on a single game level.

LOGITAC is extensively protected internationally. [I guess
distributing the game rules don't violate any laws; I hope; i'm
not selling the boards or pieces or making any $$, hope that's okay]

anyway, this goes on a for a bit.  if anybody would like the rules,
i'd be happy to send them via mail (i don't want to type all 8 pages
nor pictures in).  just send an envelope, i'll take care of the
copying costs.  

good gamin'.
