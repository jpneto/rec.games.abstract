So what I'm asking you, dear reader, is for interesting games (from an AI
standpoint) with simultaneous movement or time-sensitive games in which
several pieces have the option of moving on any given turn.

Have a look at Diplomacy - <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.diplom.org">http://www.diplom.org</a>, rec.games.diplomacy

Every piece moves at the same time and all players move their units
simultaneously each turn.  It's a pretty simple game, but it would be
a big challenge to treat mathematically.

Of course, there's the Prisoner's Dilemma game, which might be a bit
more accessible from a mathematical point of view, but not so much of
a challenge as a game like Diplomacy.

Send me an email if you want to know more.  Sounds like you could
write a very interesting thesis indeed on these lines, good luck.

A reduced version of Diplomacy with only two players might be ideal.
Computerized negotiation is a PHD thesis or two all by itself! E/F/R
versus A/G/T with I an armed neutral might be a good choice for this case.
Having two players eliminates negotiation, but using the full board with
each player in control of three nations gives enough space and enough
units to each player that the number of possibilities multiplies rapidly,
so some degree of decentralized action IS necessary.
