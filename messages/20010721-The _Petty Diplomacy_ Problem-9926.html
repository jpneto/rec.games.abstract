I’ve created a couple of games that attempt to overcome the "Petty Diplomacy"
Problem.  Since I’ve always been of the belief that no one can objectively
judge their own creation anymore than a parent can objectively judge their own
child, I’d like to get some honest feedback to see to what degree I’ve
succeeded or failed.

The "Petty Diplomacy" Problem refers to flaw well known to game designers. 
Three-player games of pure strategy – in which there is no random moves or
hidden information – tend to an inbuilt imbalance.  If one player starts to
do well, the other two will be forced to team up to eliminate him before taking
on each other.  Furthermore, when it becomes clear to a player that he cannot
win, he can effectively determine the winner by choosing moves that would
benefit one opponent over the other.

The term "Petty Diplomacy" arises because of the tendency of a player to try to
overcome these disparities by attempting to charm and deceive his opponents to
his own ends.   Rather than playing the game skillfully, the player is
endeavoring to win through low-level diplomacy, which is not what a game of
pure strategy is supposed to be about.  Even when player interaction is
effectively eliminated, for example three strangers exchanging moves through
the mail, the imbalance still remains.  If one player is perceived to be
strong, the other two will tacitly form an alliance against him.  When a player
realizes he is doomed to lose, he will often be forced to arbitrarily choose
between moves that will help one opponent or the other. 

In other types of three-player games these flaws can be overcome by introducing
an element of uncertainty, such as randomness or players keeping certain vital
information hidden from each other.  In games involving more players this
usually isn’t a problem  because the benefit of such a situation is spread
out more and there are many more ways for alliances and factions could be
divided among the players. However, the imbalance is inherent in games of
perfect information for three-players.

Or is it?  

Perhaps the imbalance lies not in the fact that it is a  three-player game, but
because the objectives set out for the players are never balanced to begin
with.  A great deal of the problem rests in the "last man standing" approach
normally used by these games that in many ways invites this kind of flawed
play.  The typical three-player game is not a single, cohesive game but rather
should be seen a game with a series of distinct stages.  Initially, the aim is
to eliminate the third player, which makes two against one scenario inevitable.
 After that it effectively becomes a two-player battle between unequal forces. 
As can bee seen, the game starts off with two players sharing the exact same
objective, forcing their alliance, while the third player is left with the
objective is to survive as long as possible.  By the time it reaches the second
stage, the balance that initially existed between the first two players is
gone.

The way to circumvent this is to eliminate the separate stages.  Instead of the
winner being the last player to reach the objective (staying in the game) the
winner should be the first player to reach an objective.  Moreover, to avert
the formation of harmful alliances, each player’s objective needs to be
different but equal from the other players’.

There is still the matter of the "Kingmaker" problem, where it becomes obvious
to player that he is losing and he effectively chooses the winner.  In order to
hamper this, each players’ movements must be limited in relationship to one
another.  This limitation must be meaningful to the overall game in a way that
enhances rather than detracts from the strategic considerations.

The first game I created with the intent of overcoming the "Petty Diplomacy"
Problem was Faustus.  The rules for which can be found here:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/faustus.html">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/faustus.html</a>

Before beginning the analysis, I feel I must offer a quick note of explanation.
 Despite its similarities, Faustus was not based on Christian  Freeling’s 
HexDame, although I’d be the first to admit the close resemblance.  I had
created Faustus quite independently while I was in college during the
mid-80’s and had not even heard of HexDame until about a year ago.  What had
happened was I was reading an article on Chess Variants that included a
three-player variant along with a passing reference to the "Petty Diplomacy"
Problem.  It was then the idea for Faustus popped nearly fully formed in my
head.  Back when I was nine years old I had created another game called Fairy
Tale Draughts by combining Checkers with Rock/Paper/Scissors.  I would take
this basic idea and bring in to whole new level.  After a moment's thought, I
realized that there was no elegant way to lay out three players on
checkerboard, so the most sensible solution was to use a hexagonal board.  The
next obvious problem was that unlike Checkers, where the pieces move in direct
opposition to each other, the pieces would be moving at angle to one another. 
I decided to borrow an idea from Polish Checkers (itself the basis for
International Checkers) and give the pieces the ability to capture backwards as
well as forwards.  Consequently, a hexagonal checkers variant that included
backwards captures was made to satisfy the needs of a three-player game.

Checkers is well suited to a three-player game.  This is because normally
pieces have two separate functions.  One is capturing the opponent’s pieces. 
The other is laying traps through compulsory captures and the sacrifice of
pieces.  In Faustus these two functions are split between a player’s
opponents.

Alliances are still formed, but the game is balanced because the players are
forced not to favor an alliance with one opponent over another.  Each of the
players needs the help of the others in different ways.  Furthermore, any
alliance can only be temporary because eventually it benefits one player more
than the other.

Let us say for example that the Wizards and the Devils have teamed up against
the Angels.  The Wizards sacrifice pieces in order to force the Angels in to
more vulnerable positions at which point the Devils move in and capture the
Angels’ pieces.  This benefits the Wizards because it diminishes the threat
of the Angels, but it does so at the cost of loss of material.  Also, the
Wizards have just help the Devils get closer to their objective, while the
Wizards might still need the Angels’ help in attacking the Devils.  From the
Devils’ perspective, they are capturing a lot of Angels, but the Angels are
the only thing protecting the Devils from the Wizards.  Eventually, either the
Devils or Wizards will have to break off the alliance because it is no longer
to their benefit.  Probably one or both will go on to form an alliance with the
Angels.  The game environment is one of mutual hostility and dependence.

The game requires players to keep calculating, constantly and carefully,
whether to form or break off an alliance.  The player must juggle alliances
with both of his opponents throughout the game.

This addresses the alliance issues, but what of the "Kingmaker" problem?.  Due
to the skewed relationship of the players and the possibility of multiple
captures, I’ve seen many games where a player who was reduced to a single
piece came back to win as well as games where one player had more pieces than
the other two sides combined only to be the one to be eliminated.  A player’s
standing in the game can not be reckoned in terms of material alone.  The
position of the player’s pieces, their mobility, their interrelationship to
their opponents’ pieces, and the phase of the game must all be taken in to
consideration.  Because of this, it is often not clear until near the very end
who will win and who will lose, at which point a player can do little to change
the outcome.  Even if he wanted to, he’d be limited in his ability to affect
one or the other of his opponents.

When I finally got around the tedious task of programming Faustus I decided the
easiest approach was to make it a losing game and then assign the moves to the
opposing player.  A little while later I realized that simply by taking a
three-player game and playing it negatively, one could also overcome the "Petty
Diplomacy" problem.  Which gave rise to my next attempt, Cerberus.  The rules
for it can be found here:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/cerberus.html">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/games/cerberus.html</a>

I chose three-player hexagonal losing Chess for a number of reasons.  First,
because Chess is the most popular attempt at a three-player strategic game. 
Second, the game had to use a hexagonal board for the same reasons Faustus did.
 Third, both Losing Chess and hexagonal Chess had been played and analyzed
sufficiently that I could use them as foundation without having to go back and
reinvent the wheel.  Of the two best versions of HexChess, I chose not to use
Wladislaw Ginksi’s because it would make the board too crowded.  What’s
more, the pawns in Dave McCooey’s HexChess tend to have greater mobility and
promote faster, which is usually considered a shortcoming, but in Losing Chess
this  is something of a virtue.

Contrary to common sense, the strategy of Losing Chess is not about losing your
pieces. Instead, counter-intuitive as it may seem, the most important strategic
concept is that there is an advantage in having more pieces than your opponent.
 Having more material gives you the possibility to surround the opponent with
your pieces, gradually restricting him until he runs out of safe moves, and
then eliminate your pieces one by one. To restrict your opponent, you would not
only need material advantage, but also advantage in mobility and space.  All
strategic principles arise from this one idea: restricting your opponent, so
that he is forced to capture all your pieces.

In a three-player game it is difficult for a single player to gain a
conspicuous lead since it is nearly impossible for one player to outnumber his
opponents.  What’s more, the factors of mobility and space are limited not
only because the board is so crowded but also each player is flanked on two
sides.

The "Kingmaker" problem is hurdled because the measure of player’s skill in
Losing Chess is his ability to restrict his opponents and force them to capture
your pieces.

A three-player strategy game should be about maintaining a precarious
equilibrium while fighting a battle on two fronts.
