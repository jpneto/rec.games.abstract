I intended the rectangles to be oriented either vertically or
horizontally. But maybe... letting them be rotated, as long as you
aren't drawing skewed parallelograms by mistake, would be more fun.
Hmmmm....

I would tend to agree.  Harder, but more fun.

Another variant would additionbally disallow two edges overlapping in
more than a single point.  They can still cross, but not have a common
segment of positive length.

In either case, the array of dots probably should be much bigger than
just 6 by 6.

Since every rectangle uses up four dots, the maximum number of moves on
an NxN board is NxN/4.  For a 6x6 board, this is 9 moves, which I agree
is too little, especially since it is likely that some dots will be
unused.  10x10 gives up to 25 moves, which sounds O.K., but if
experience shows that typical games end in far fewer moves, even bigger
boards should be used.  The variant that disallows sharing of edge
segments would probably need a bigger board.
