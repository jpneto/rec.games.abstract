Christian, we both know that a public vote would disfavor me and favor you,
which is precisely why you're campaigning for it.  People thought of you as
their favorite designer for decades before I ever even showed up.  I'm not
going to let Monkey Queen get slapped with a shitty grade because I lost a
popularity contest to a legendary folk hero.

Do you want to have a game contest or a popularity contest?  That's really
what it comes down to.  What will not happen is you winning a popularity
contest and then claiming you beat Monkey Queen fair and square.  Monkey
Queen will not be in a popularity contest to begin with.

Boy am I ever popular. Tell you what, I don't give a damn who wins the
contest and being accused of scheming towards a result is not what I'm
here for either. If withdrawing Grabber is the only way to convince
you of that, then consider it done. I foresee accusations directed at
any winner now, no matter what, and that's not my idea of fun.
