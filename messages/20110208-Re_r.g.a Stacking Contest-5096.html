Christian, we both know that a public vote would disfavor me and favor you,
which is precisely why you're campaigning for it.  People thought of you as
their favorite designer for decades before I ever even showed up.  I'm not
going to let Monkey Queen get slapped with a shitty grade because I lost a
popularity contest to a legendary folk hero.

Do you want to have a game contest or a popularity contest?  That's really
what it comes down to.  What will not happen is you winning a popularity
contest and then claiming you beat Monkey Queen fair and square.  Monkey
Queen will not be in a popularity contest to begin with.

Boy am I ever popular. Tell you what, I don't give a damn who wins the
contest and being accused of scheming towards a result is not what I'm
here for either. If withdrawing Grabber is the only way to convince
you of that, then consider it done. I foresee accusations directed at
any winner now, no matter what, and that's not my idea of fun.

It's too bad that this contest which resulted in excellent new games
has deteriorated into this.  How about a prize jury?  Maybe those with
games in the contest could agree on a jury of three impartial judges
to decide the winner?  I'm sure Christian knows some good candidates,
perhaps Schmittberger would be willing.  Other possibles names: Peter
Aronson, Larry Smith, Mark Thompson.  Don't beat me up if you don't
like this suggestion.
