Excerpts from the bgg abstract games forum thread, Favorite Freeling
Games.

Ralf Gering: "Emergo lacks the excitement of piece promotion, which is
essential to draughts variants. To me Emergo is a 'castrated' version
of column checkers."

Christian Freeling: "And why should having your men promoted during
the game give more exitement than having them all 'promoted' in the
first place?  Is that logic?  I could as well argue that rather than
being 'castrated', Emergo has a lot more balls to begin with."

Gotta go with Christian on this one.  A game of kings seems ballsier,
though I must confess I've never considered the precise testicularity
of a game.  This will be Ralf Gering's legacy.  The ball sack index.

Christian Freeling: "I don't know precisely in which year which games
were invented, because the explosion of SE Fireworks in 2000 destroyed
all my possesions, including all registrations."

I for one am greatly relieved that Christian survived the blast, even
though his hair apparently did not.

Christian Freeling: "[Dameo] is uncharted in terms of strategy, and
doesn't have a 'draws problem'."

That's like saying, "I installed a set of new tires yesterday and they
haven't worn out yet."  Checkers wouldn't have a "draws problem"
either if there was only a Dameo-sized body of Checkers knowledge.

Christian Freeling: "The problem with Int. Draughts [...]:
Draws all over the finals!  Int. Draughts is in a midlife crisis and
there's no cure. It happened to Checkers, Shashki, Dama, all the old
school variants."

Ralf Gering: "Boyer already described in 1951 at least 20 different
cures to diminish the rate of draws, which all worked - but weren't
accepted for cultural reasons."

Wow, I never realized the diminished draw Checkers variant was such a
holy grail.  Cage is a finite, decisive Checkers variant.  It can't be
the only one, can it?  Certainly Cage is the only true game of
annihilation among the hundreds of variants.

Christian Freeling: "I'm not Kris Burm."

No worries.  One Kris Burm is plenty.
