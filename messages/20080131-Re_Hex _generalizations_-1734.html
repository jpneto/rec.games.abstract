<br><blockquote type=cite>These are all variations on Hex.&nbsp; None of them is a generalization of

<br>is.&nbsp; The word is being used to describe variations and families of
<br>variations.&nbsp; If you list a family of games, all of which have one
<br>little item in common with Hex you haven't generalized Hex.
<br>
<br>You want to see a real nice example of a generalization?&nbsp; Look no
<br>further than Atoll.&nbsp; You have a very succinctly, precisely defined,
<br>infinite set of games.&nbsp; Every game in the set has all of the central,
<br>defining characteristics of Hex.&nbsp; Both players are trying to form a
<br>connection between two of their opposite segments.&nbsp; In a randomly
<br>filled board, exactly one player achieves his cross board connection.
<br>There are a multiple of four of perimeter segments, alternating
<br>between black and white.&nbsp; It's a two player, equal goals game.&nbsp; Etc.,
<br>etc., etc.&nbsp; The only difference between the games in the set is the
<br>number of perimeter segments.&nbsp; One <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>special case<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is when there are
<br>four perimeter segments.&nbsp; That member is equivalent to Hex.&nbsp; Hex is a
<br><b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>special case<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the more general Atoll.&nbsp; Is any of this making
<br>sense?
<br></blockquote>
<br>I think so.&nbsp; This seems to agree with most of the second paragraph of my
<br>previous post (of which you only responded to the first paragraph):
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>you may well be intending "generalization" and/or
<br>"superset" to indicate that all cases within the larger set involve
<br>similar strategies to those within the smaller set, in which case it
<br>would be much more reasonable to say that Mind Ninja is not a
<br>generalization of Atoll after all; "connect opposite segments" involves
<br>different strategies than, say, "create a solid 3x3 block" or "create
<br>the corners of three different squares of any size and orientation". 
</blockquote>
<br>Now, examining Brian's examples in this light:
<br>
<br>Colorful Hex is trivially isomorphic to Hex, so there isn't (in any
<br>meaningful sense) a larger set at all.
<br>
<br>Super Pie-Rule Hex can involve notably different strategies than Hex,
<br>depending on how far you deviate from K=1 and J=0.&nbsp; In particular,
<br>K=0 and J=1 is Misere Hex, while K=N and J=0 degenerates into a trivial
<br>first-player win.
<br>
<br>Horrible Luck Hex is pretty much equivalent to Super Pie-Rule Hex with
<br>K=random(0 or 1) and J=0.
<br>
<br>Hmm, what about generalizing Hex to higher dimensions?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * 0-D tokens, 1-D goals, 2-D board = Hex
<br>&nbsp; * 1-D tokens, 2-D goals, 3-D board = ?
<br>
<br>Certainly not as elegant as Atoll, though, and moving beyond a 3-D
<br>board would be awfully difficult for anything but a computer.
