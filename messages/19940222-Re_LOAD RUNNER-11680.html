Since my mail to you bounced ("&lt;local - xke 32767&gt;: user "xke" doesn't exist")
I post this:

: Hi;

: This is the first time I post on the group. I am looking for a game called
: "load runner". I believe it is a very very old game (at lest as old as
: APPLE IIe or IIc). Also has pc version.

Its name is Lode Runner, and it was published by Bro/derbound Software (that's
a Danish o with an slash through it). It also included an editor that allowed
you to create your own levels, and I remember my friends and me creating dozens
of levels and passing them around to solve them. I played it on an Apple II+.

: That is all I remember. I miss that game so much. Please drop me a mail or post
: if you know that game ( it most likely  has another name). or any clue about it.

variations possible. Timing and move coordination was <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>so<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> important. Should you
get some PC version or a pointer to one, I'd be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> thankful if you
could forward that information to me (my Apple II unluckily is history already).
