That's exactly what happened to me - almost.  After a few days I had
everything I needed except one algorithm.  It wasn't two cubes next to each
other, though it was like 25 years ago so I don't remember exactly.  I think
it was completely opposite corners, but I'm not sure.

Anyway, most of the two weeks was spent figuring out the one needed
algorithm which I finally did.

The work around I use is to mess it up and solve it to that point
until it coincidentally doesn't need the algorithm that I didn't
manage to work out.  I got bored of it after some time, but I imagine
I'll pick one back up and maybe work out the last part if someone else
I know raises an interest in it.

I think you can get it, if you got everything else but that.  In my case I
really had to throw myself into it.

I believe designing a game is very much like solving a puzzle.  You have to
find a solution to the problem of creating an equitable rule set.  One
that's simple, etc., etc., etc. - all the constraints you impose on yourself
in creating the problem.
