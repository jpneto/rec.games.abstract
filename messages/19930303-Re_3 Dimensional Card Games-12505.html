I was thinking about card games and realized, that all (at least the ones I
know) card decks are two dimensional (value x suit or colour).
Has anyone ever thought of a three (or even four, five - well, I could go
on like this for quite a while...) dimensional card deck? The obvious (?)
design I came up with was: 
	VALUE x COLOUR x SIZE
If you give each dimension four possible values, you get 64 different cards, 
which looks like a nice deck-size to me.

Avalon Hill markets a card game called "Sleuth." There are two decks: A gem
deck and a search deck. The gem deck has 3 dimensions: (3 types of gems)*
(3 different quantities of said gem)* (4 different colors) for a total of
36 distinct cards. One card is hidden; players are dealt or shown the rest
of the deck. The object is to figure out what the hidden gem card is. Players
ask each other questions about what they have, e.g.  "How many red cards do
you have?" or "Show me all your green opals." The search deck is used to
govern what types of questions each player may ask. 
The game is sort of like the "distilled best essence" of Clue, without any
bogus dice rolls. The big challenge is being meticulously accurate in your
bookkeeping during the game. Some worksheets are provided, but they may not
be big enough if more than 5 are playing (3-7 may play.)
I have written a solitaire version of this game for my HP-28S calculator.
It simulates both decks, and as many opponents as desired. I get answers
to my questions without having an opponent's entire hand revealed to me.
This is useful for getting into the properly rigorous frame of mind
