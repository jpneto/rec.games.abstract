Lol, I don't have fifty friends, and even if I did I wouldn't bother

Why don't we have two polls, one for entrants only and one

No, I won't set Monkey Queen up as a sitting duck for everyone I've ever
insulted to come and take a numeric pot shot at.  It's no secret that I'm
the contentious one here.  I've been in a lot more flame wars and have a lot
more enemies than the other contestants.

An open vote will turn the contest into a popularity contest, plain and
simple.  People will barely read the rules, if at all, and then vote for
their favorite designer.  We both know that's true.  And then when the
results are in, we'll all know who the most popular designer is among you,
Cameron, and Dieter.  It sure as shit won't be me.

Just for example, Gamerman already said he'd deduct points for Monkey Queen
not really qualifying as a stacking game.  Boy, I thought, good thing
Gamerman won't be voting.  Now there'll be a whole bunch of Gamermans,
voting with no knowledge of the contest parameters.

Christian, we both know that a public vote would disfavor me and favor you,
which is precisely why you're campaigning for it.  People thought of you as
their favorite designer for decades before I ever even showed up.  I'm not
going to let Monkey Queen get slapped with a shitty grade because I lost a
popularity contest to a legendary folk hero.

Do you want to have a game contest or a popularity contest?  That's really
what it comes down to.  What will not happen is you winning a popularity
contest and then claiming you beat Monkey Queen fair and square.  Monkey
Queen will not be in a popularity contest to begin with.
