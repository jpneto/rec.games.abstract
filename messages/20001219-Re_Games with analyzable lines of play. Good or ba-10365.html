I strongly disagree with you here. Communications in a lossy channel

Well, that's why I don't like it! (I think...what's a "lossy channel", is
that a typo?)  For me, knowing just the rules should be enough to play a
game...that's why it's related to the chess books:  I just want to sit
down and play a game without having to bring a bunch of "baggage".  I'm
certainly not saying that that Bridge and Chess are broken or anything.  
They are great games and they deserve all the analysis, but they are just
not for me (low attention span, I guess).

And in response to another post:

Although I'm not a chess fan, I can say with certainty that there's no way
in hell it will be "dead" in twenty years EVEN IF it is "solved" (which
seems unlikely to me too).  This solution will require so much computing
power that humans will simply not be able to "do" it.  The game will
easily maintain its interest.  Robots make great knitters, but there will
always be a market for knitting needles.
