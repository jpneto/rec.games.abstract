Not that anyone's interested, but they didn't.
I still use it all the time.  I got the new address for here,
out of sympathy for my colleagues who mightn't wish to keep
receiving shrill crackpot emails from the back-stabbing Steere.
Consideration for others is a concept unknown to Steere, of course.

As for my colleagues, they have Steere's number now,
now that he has published their private emails on the net.

Can anyone here still have a shred of sympathy for Steere knowing he:

1: Tried to get me into trouble by writing to my colleagues,
    (has <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>anyone<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> on the net ever stooped so low?)

2: Published their emails to the world;

3: Bragged publicly about doing 1 &amp; 2.

Freeling, can you have any shred of affinity for you protege
after these reprehensibilities?   (This is not a rhetorical question,
I would really like to know!)

Bill
