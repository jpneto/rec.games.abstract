The accusations of poor sportsmanship on the part of the Chinook team
are ridiculous, and I am appalled by the utter lack of class shown by
some posters on this topic.  A public apology is called for, but it
appears that some people are too small to admit when they are wrong.

The ending of the Tinsley - Chinook match was tragic and unforeseen,
and must have been a bitter disappointment to Jonathan and everyone
else involved.

Perhaps you do not understand how important Tinsley is to the Chinook
project, and how highly they hold him in regard.  When Chinook was
first developed, it was almost immediately grandmaster strength.  One
consequence of this was that it was very difficult to teach the program
to play better -- who could it learn from?  The answer was Tinsley.
Chinook's evaluation function was fine-tuned by using Tinsley's games
as a model of near-perfect checkers play.

Since that time, it can be said that Chinook has been developed and
groomed with one main goal in mind: to defeat Tinsley.  He represents
the first great challenge to the Chinook team, and only solving the
game will surpass that accomplishment.  I can tell you that they feel
honoured and fortunate to have the opportunity to play the greatest
human checkers player ever (past, present and the foreseeable future).

It has always been important to the Chinook team that they challenge
Tinsley while he is still at the peak of his powers.  The fact that
he did not lose a single game during the entire decade previous to
the first Chinook match demonstrates that he is still in fine form.
Jonathan has long feared that the break-through would come too late,
and that the hard-earned achievement would be diminished by defeating
a less-than-perfect Tinsley.

Of course Chinook should now be declared champion, for whatever that is
worth.  There are many ways to win or lose a match, and default wins
are part of any sport.  The score of the match is irrelevant.  A tennis
player who must retire due to injury loses the match, even if she was
about to serve for match point.  Who would dare call her innocent
opponent a poor sportsman?  I say only an ignorant ass.

We should all empathize with the Chinook team, rather than criticizing
them for circumstances beyond their control.  Imagine how you would
feel if you trained for years to win the gold medal at the Olympics,
only to achieve a hollow victory when your greatest rival was absent
because his country boycotted the games.  Would you decline the gold
medal?  You know that there will always be an asterisk beside your name
in the record books, but all you can reasonably do is accept it, and
hope for another chance to prove that you are a worthy champion.

I sincerely hope that Marion Tinsley makes a complete recovery, and
again is able to challenge the machine in this most <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>human<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> drama.
