So... this is sarcasm?  Because Whopper 100 (or Whopper 101, I
suppose) would just as validly be a generalization of Hex as a
generalization of Chess, and you state that the only valid
generalization of Hex is Atoll.

Yes, that last bit about Whopper was intended to be facetious.
Whopper is not a generalization of Hex or Chess or any other game.
But the reasoning as to why Whopper (Whopper Infinity defines a class
of games, as covered in a previous post) should be a generalization of
Chess is the same reasoning used to claim that Mind Ninja is a
generalization of Hex.

Your three examples of Hex variants don't define a class of games.

It's a subjective matter as to whether or not a class of games
qualifies as a generalization of Hex.  But there seems to be some
agreement here that the general case should capture the essence of, or
have most or all of the "crucial aspects" of the special case being
generalized.  It's amazing to me that Mind Ninja is considered by
anyone to be a generalization of Hex.  So it shares one little
property of Hex that in attaining your goal you prevent your opponent
from attaining his.  And it doesn't even fully capture <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
property.  In Hex it's a two way street.  Each player is trying to
form his own given construct and simultaneously trying to prevent the
other from attaining his.  In the unequal goals game of Mind Ninja
only <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player is trying to form a given construct and the other is
only trying to prevent it, not form one of his own.  Just as Whopper
is a long way from being a generalization of Chess, Mind Ninja is
about that far from being a generalization of Hex.
