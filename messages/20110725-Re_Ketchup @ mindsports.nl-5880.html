OK, Christian, have to call you on this.  Arguing that a baby's
inability to checkmate because of the movement rules is a clear case
of arguing with a straw man, actually a straw man that you've stood on
its head.  It's like criticizing chess because a player would have
been able to checkmate if not for that stupid rule that pawns have to
move forward only.  The rule determines the strategy and the tactics,
and if a player misses a mate because he put a baby in the wrong
place, that's the player's problem, not the game's.

Hi Michael, that's a view that would make any questioning of rules
impossible. Just have the players obey them!

Actually, no.  You didn't question Monkey Queen's overall quality as
game, you didn't use the rules to argue that it lacks depth or clarity
or drama.  Criticizing a game as an entity is obviously fair game.
You picked one rule and used it to argue, out of context, against
finitude.  It is the fact that you argue out of context with a
specific ax to grind that makes it an invalid argument.
