Answering the question "What has Mark Steere ever done for abstract

but I am uneasy with Richard Hutnik's attempt to subsume
all existing chess variants into something he calls "IAGO

Again, the nail has been hammered with atomic precision.
"Intellectually dishonest."  To me, Richard Hutnik has just seemed
shady from the word go.  Sorry Rich, but you really have.  "To possess
rather than to promote."  Richard Hutnik in a nutshell.  Again, sorry
Rich, but if the shoe fits...

I hope that his desire to define and classify everything
doesn't mean that this is where he wants to go with abstract games also.

Nothing in the field of abstract games is as bizarre as the Ing
variant of Go.  Short of that, Iago's game classification system holds
top honors.
