<div class="moz-text-flowed">Heh heh, no you are completely correct. I was just being 
lazy and trying to avoid explaining that too, plus I didn't 
want to strain the credulity of young readers by trying to 
make them believe things were ever that primitive. We did 
indeed use a d6 and a d20 that was numbered from 0-9 twice. 
Eventually someone had the bright idea of using a china 
marker (what we used to write on glass and plastic before 
they invented AV markers [See! Now do you see how OLD that 
makes me look and feel? I hope you are happy!]) to color in 
one set of the numbers, which were then the 11-20 numbers.
<br>
<br>Of course, before that we just used d6's from RISK and our 
SPI games. (Low-High = 1-10 or 11-20) plus (Low-High = 
1-5/11-15 or 6-10/16-20) plus a last d6 roll from 1-5, 
reroll the 6's gave us a d20 roll. We usually rolled three 
different colored d6's at the same time, with pre-declared 
colors being used for the first, second, and third rolls. 
You want to believe we would curse out E.G.Gygax for 
inflicting this upon us while we ran through the labourious 
process over and over again.

<br><blockquote type=cite>A long time ago we used to do things like that with dice to 
sim multi-siders we didn't have. You would roll a d6 and a 
d10. If the d6 = 1,2, or 3, the d10 roll stood. If the d6 = 
4,5, or 6, you added 10 to the d10 roll, giving yourself a 
flat "20" sider.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simulating a d20 with a d10?&nbsp; I was under the impression that prior 
to the invention of modern d10s, the only d10s you could get were d20s 
numbered from 0 to 9 twice, thus one would be far more likely in 
practice to simulate a d10 with d20, rather than vice-versa.&nbsp; (Of 
course, as an intellectual exercise, all this is moot.)
