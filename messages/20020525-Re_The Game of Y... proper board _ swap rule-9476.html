I downloaded the game and played a couple

Yes, I would agree with that.  The text below is taken directly from the
Zillions site:

-----------------------------------------------------
Q: What kind of board games are hardest to program in Zillions?

Zillions doesn't currently support:

  games whose object is to connect sides, i.e. "connection
      games" such as Hex, the Game of Y.

  games that use a lot math in their movement or
       scoring (other than merely counting up pieces
       on the board)

  positions that have multiple pieces on them
       simultaneously

  pieces that occupy multiple positions simultaneously

  cards
-----------------------------------------------------


If a "Y" game was implemented then obviously there are work-arounds to
get the Zillions engine to play and understand connection games.
However, it appears these types of games are not one of the engine's
strengths.
