Anyone want to discuss approaches to designing Othello playing programs?
What strategies might be used to overcome Othello's reputed insusceptibility
to tree searches?  Indeed, to what degree does it deserve such a reputation?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've never heard of this.  I would say the opposite: Othello is one of the
best-suited games for state-space (tree) search.  It has a manageable
branching factor and static evaluation functions do pretty well.  The Othello
programs I've heard of perform tree search, and the best Othello programs are
about on par with the best humans now.

If you're looking for a game that's convincingly unsuited to tree search, 
try backgammon or go.

It would be interesting to see a planning approach for Othello (or for any
game), but I don't know of any good (ie, non-research) game programs that
do any kind of abstract planning.
