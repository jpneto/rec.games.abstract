Got that right.

I think you're doing an outstanding job overall with the contest overall,
Daniel, but I for one am totally at peace with you not being a judge.  Two
issues.
  1) Ethical conflict.  You're the contest organizer.  So now the other
  judges submit their scores to you and you know exactly how much you need
  to fudge your own score to achieve your desired outcome.
  2) You bizarrely opened a discussion on the admissibility of my game, six
  weeks into the contest.  For me, that all by itself that blows your judge
  qualification out of the water.  Like I said, I don't want to dwell on
  that but there was never a rational explanation.  Like, "Oh, yeah.  I had
  7 Heinekens under my belt and I don't know what I was thinking."

If you don't want drama, Daniel, then don't go out of your way to create
drama.  Have a different epiphany.  Wake up in the middle of the night in a
cold sweat, suddenly aware that your drapes totally clash with your sofa. 
No victim in that epiphany.  You don't bizarrely attempt to sabotage your
own contest with that epiphany.  Some moldy old drapes just end up in a
dumpster behind an apartment building.

Focus, Daniel.  The idea that me and Christian and others have proposed is
for each judge to have 100 points which they can distribute to the games any
way they wish.  To that I would add the following suggestion:  The judges
submit their scores to you independently, without knowledge of each other's
scores.  Once you have all of the judge scores, which you should keep
confidential until you have all of them, you immediately make the all the
scores public and we see who wins.

I think there should be some discussion of a tiebreaker, however unlikely
one may be.  With an odd number of judges, each judge could cast a single
vote for his favorite game in the tie, but if there are only two judges then
I don't know what.

If there can only be two judges, I'm ok with that, though I think you should
still try to get a third, if at all possible, Daniel.  I'm also ok with (and
appreciative of) you offering yourself as a playing partner for the judges.
