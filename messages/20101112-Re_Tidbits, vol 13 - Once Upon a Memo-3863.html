email from yours truly to the head of the math department at the
University of Canterbury, Jennifer Brown

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's my understanding that an email from Mark Steere accusing Bill
Taylor of trying to shut down the Google Group rec.games.abstract has
made its way to you. While I don't honestly think any self-respecting
member of math department at the University of Canterbury has time to
waste dealing with Steere's insipid and petulant accusation- or any
petty internet dispute for that matter- I want to clear Bill's good
name. Mark Steere is a hypocrite and a man of little integrity. For
the year of 2010 on a consistent basis Steere posted disruptive,
insulting and irrelevant material to rec.games.abstract, a group which
was created by none other than Bill Taylor. This is just one of
Steere's immature rants <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/9923f6de9c896bce#">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/9923f6de9c896bce#</a>
.. When Steere wasn't heckling and insulting other designers and
members of the abstract games community, he was promoting games that
he had made years if not decades ago. That's not the worst of it, in
this particular post, Steere admits to drug abuse. Quote  "The only
lighting ceremony is going to me lighting a big spleef in my backyard
- for me to smoke, by myself."  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/msg/c99d9fc1253a43bb">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/msg/c99d9fc1253a43bb</a>
I'm the owner of the group Bill Taylor has been promoting
recre.games.combinatorial, which I established because Steere
singlehandedly diminished the integrity of rec.games.abstract and
suppressed the respectful encouraging environment that otherwise would
have existed in that group. I wanted to create a forum for the
discussion of abstract games at a technical level in an encouraging
and respectful environment, which I would be able to maintain by
moderating the group. in this thread
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/4bded1ed25da9b27#">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/4bded1ed25da9b27#</a>
you can see that Bill Taylor's promotion of the group has allowed two
disillusioned users of rec.games.abstract to find their way over to
the new site, a positive action on Taylor's part by all accounts.
I would not take anything Mark Steere has to say seriously, in fact I
would promptly discontinue communicating with Steere as he is clearly
not the sort of person one wants to associate herself with.

Thank You.
