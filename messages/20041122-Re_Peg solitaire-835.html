<br>If you do a google search for the phrase "pagoda function" one of the 
early results is an article called "Modelling and Solving English Peg 
Solitaire" which sounds related to your problem.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I ask this because if i can compute the possible final configurations,

<br>I'm not sure I understand you; pagoda functions are independent of 
configurations.&nbsp; You probably will want a set of many pagoda functions, 
but not all of these will change after each move.
<br>
<br>Here's what I would try:
<br>Before you even know the configuration, have some ordered set of pagoda 
functions.&nbsp; You can create a map from every jump to a list containing 
its difference for each pagoda function.&nbsp; (I'm assuming the board is 
known at this point, even if the particular start is not.&nbsp; So by "jump" 
I mean any particular move possible if pegs were in the right places.) 
No jump will increase the values, so these will all be non-positive.
<br>
<br>Once you have start and goal configurations, calculate a vector of the 
current score for each pagoda function, and another vector representing 
the goal.
<br>
<br>There are two sets of jumps we'll be interested in: first, the legal 
jumps from any particular position.&nbsp; Secondly, the set of jumps which 
decrease any pagoda function to less than the goal value.&nbsp; The size of 
this second set will always be decreasing as we get deeper, since pagoda 
functions decrease as legal moves are made.&nbsp; Now, you only need to 
search the intersection of these two sets.&nbsp; When this intersection is 
empty, you can start backtracking.&nbsp; This should happen shallower than 
searching based solely on the set of legal jumps - you may need to 
change the set of pagoda functions to optimize the program.&nbsp; I think 
what you are doing is like this, except your set of pagoda functions is 
empty.
<br>
<br>Use DFS.&nbsp; After each jump you try, just add the difference vector for 
that jump to the current score, and continue.
<br>
<br>By the way, in your initial message you say you are keeping a "cache" of 
all configurations that cannot be reduced to a single peg - I suspect 
that this could be quite large (since 33 holes gives roughly 2^33, about 
8 billion, configurations) so I wonder if memory use is part of the 
problem.&nbsp; Also, how are you searching this cache?
<br>
