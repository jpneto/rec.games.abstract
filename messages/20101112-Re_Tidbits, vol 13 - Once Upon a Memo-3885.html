You see, discovering the symple mechanism, applying it first where I
found it, in the 'connection flavored'  Star theme embodied by Symple,
then progressing to the configuration theme with Lhexus and the
othelloanian territory theme with Charybdis ... at that point anybody
could have noticed its broad range of applications.

So anybody could have thought ... "hey, what about Go?" ... and thus
could have come up with Sygo. In fact, when I realized it, the evening
of November 10th while walking the dogs (you guys should try that for
inspiration :) I felt a bit of a worry. The next day I immediately
could write the game down. The merger of the ideas involved suggested
its own solutions, rather than posing any problems. Thus a game was
born that, in so far as games are considered to have intrinsic value,
is more valuable than, say, Havannah.

Symple, Lhexus, Charybdis, mere signposts on the way to Sygo ... while
you guys were wasting energy that, in my opinion at least, could have
been put to better use.

And I regret that.
