1) How does one properly pronounce "hnefatafl"? :-)

I forget where I got my information, but I pronounce it like this: The h
is not silent, the e is as in "bed," the a's are as in "father," the f's
are as in "stuff," the t and l are as in "table." Apparently each (or
most) of the modern Scandinavian languages would pronounce it somewhat
differently.

2) In the combinatorial games literature which I own or to which I
   have easy access, I recall no discussion of these games (henefatafl
   specifically, not general "tafl" games such as 9 Men's Morris, Fox and
   Geese, etc).  Does anyone know of any?

I wish I did. Part of the problem is that there is no agreement on what
the rules were. There is more of a consensus on hnefatafl than on, say,
ludus latrunculorum. There is actually quite a bit of similarity among
many proposed reconstructions of the rules, especially more recent ones,
and many of the rules sets do make the game enjoyable. But even rather
minor differences in the rules can make a big difference in stategy and
tactics. Since there is not a large enough group of people playing the
game according to the same rules, we do not have a body of experts
gradually building up practical knowledge of the game which could be
passed on to other talented people, and to a lesser extent to ordinary
mortals. A pity, because it looks like hnefatafl could be quite a good
game if we had some good strategic principles.
