(This is a game that maybe is technically inappropriate for
rec.games.abstract, since luck plays a role {although the random-
number generators are only the player's own minds}. But it uses more
strategy than you might first think.)

For 2 players.
Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper.

A move consists of both players each secretly picking an integer
between 1 and n.
Both numbers are then revealed. An x is then drawn in the grid-square
that has the column number of player 1's number, and has the row
number of player 2's number.
So, in other words, player 1 picks the horizontal position of the
number, and player 2 picks the vertical position.

If the x lands in an empty square, then the game continues.

But, however, the first time an x lands in a square that already has
an x, then the game is over. Player 1 wins if this final x was written
on an oddly numbered move. Player 2 wins if this x was written on an
evenly numbered move.
So, in other words, if there are an odd number of x's at game's end --
and an even number of squares with x's -- then player 1 wins. If there
are an even number of x's -- and an odd number of squares with x's --
then player 2 wins.

What kind of strategies will help you win at this game (if you cannot
read the other player's mind)?

I'm not sure if I'll have time to work on it, but I like the idea of
the game.

I think a mixed strategy will be needed, but it will probably require
a computer program to solve for it, since every move creates subgames,
and those subgames (and their subgames) need to be analyzed first.
