INTRODUCTION  Cancer is a variant of Go.  The two players, Red and
White, each have unlimited stones of their own color.  They also share
an unlimited supply of black, cancer stones.  Draws cannot occur in
Cancer.   Mark Steere designed Cancer in February, 2012.

OBJECT  The object of Cancer is to completely annihilate your
opponent, emptying the board of his color stones.  If your placement
eliminates all red and white stones from the board, you win.  If your
placement eliminates all of your own stones while enemy stones remain
on the board, you lose.

PLAY  Starting with Red, the two players take turns adding a single
stone to the board.  On his first turn, Red must place a red stone.
 Likewise for White.  On subsequent turns, a player must place either
a stone of his own color or a cancer stone, subject to restrictions,
but not both.

The vanishing board is a neat implementation of the 'Atlantis
principle'. Since it is an elimination game, "Go variant" might raise
an eyebrow or two. Further doubt may be fuelled by the fact that
there's no counting and that the size or color of the captured groups
don't seem to matter all that much, except in the vacant territory
they leave behind. So what's the strategy, sitting it out till
gridlock? That may be quite a while. Fortunately it's a Mark Steere
game, very much so I would say, so the longer players can enjoy it,
the better. I wonder if it beats Tanbo. ;-)

As usual, Christian, you've rendered an opinion while failing to
understand the rules.  There is no passing or "sitting out" in
Cancer.   Since Cancer is highly scalable, gamelength is a simply a
function of board size.
