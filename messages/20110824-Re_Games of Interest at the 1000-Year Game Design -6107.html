The way Luis describes the strategy makes the strategy dilemma sound
similar to *Star, just with totally different tactics. The more I
think about Yodd, the more I love the idea.  I hope, hope, hope it
plays well.

I have no doubts about that. I forgot to include the Xodd link:

Despite Luis' saying that joining groups becomes harder, and that the
game is more tactical than the hexversion, I have rather high
expectations of it.

This is all 'intuition' of course, and since mentioning that concept
will trigger a response by Mark anyway, it would be nice to hear
something more insightful about Yodd than "it sounds like a Kris Burm
game" and "the greatest game that nobody ever actually played".
