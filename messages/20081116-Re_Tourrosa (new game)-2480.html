Wow, thank you!

The rules are a little too busy and arbitrary though.  It's like three

I agree the rules seem a bit messy at first, with lots of possible
situations that can arise in a game. But once you try them, you see
that they are quite "natural": the sowing and the stacking are really
just one movement mirrored, and we wanted to see stacks of pieces
destroyed and rebuilt quickly on the board; the sliding can be seen as
an
inertia coming from the first action, well paired with the jump of
opponent's pieces, or the jump on top of yours (stack).

Probably I described them clumsily, but I think these rules make sense
as a whole!

Well, you are right. We focused on the gameplay, rather than making a
game original in every aspect...

What happens if there's a

The jump is compulsory and a piece is not allowed to stop its
sliding. Since the board is devised in a way that it is really just
one track coiled upon itself twice, each piece/stack is reacheable, so
there can't be a draw.

This comes from actual experience. I have not a formal proof, so maybe
both players could concoct a draw by repetition somehow. It seems that
a player cannot shelter in a draw, because the other can always
capture something. I have to think about that!

Thank you for your interest!

Bye, Jean
