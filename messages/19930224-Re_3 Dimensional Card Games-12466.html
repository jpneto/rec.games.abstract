That's interesting.  What distinguishes a "game" from "Pattern

Hard to say.  What distinguishes a "dog" from "swimming"?

This is one metaphor you could use.  Start by limiting the discussion to
a small domain of thing which work on a scale like the above, then use
that to help you understand the distinction.  It isn't what I was
implying, though.

 Is one a subset (proper or otherwise) of the other?

The correspondance of common nouns to membership sets was proposed by
Montigue in Montigue Semantics (others have had similar ideas too
numerous to mention here)  This is a pretty primative way to
conceptualize the linguistic phenomon, and tend to work better with
abstract mathematical examples or contrived hypotheticals, and tends to
break down dramatically when applied to everyday speech.

 Or perhaps they are measures on different axes?  Do the
axes intersect? Orthogonally? Or are they parallel or skew?
Linear? (I doubt it)

Help.  Stop.  No more metaphors.  Above you list a whole lot of
variations on fuzzy semantics (which poses meaning as a scalar 
from 0(not at all) to 1(definately) for both truth and set mebership,
and is typically just as much of a failure as Montigue Semantics.

When you go on to talk about parellel and skew axes, you lost me.
Measurement bases which are parrellel imply that they are equivalent,
and cannot be skew under any circumstances.

Sensitive to initial conditions?

What?  Now I'm completely lost.  I can't even figure out what sort of
metaphor you are trying for here.  Perhaps it'd be better if you let the
metaphors alone for a while and just asked me what I meant.

I mean that I typically condier games to involve making choices and
progressing based on those choices (actually it's more complicated than
that, as "games" is a radial category in the sense that there are other
prototypes I also use "games to refer to which are distinct from this
one, but not unrelated to it), and that Set is not a very good example
of this prototype.

More simply, I felt that Set was mechanical and didn't feel like a game
due to this mechanical aspect.  This further suggest that Set was like
an exercise for me.  Your milage may vary.
