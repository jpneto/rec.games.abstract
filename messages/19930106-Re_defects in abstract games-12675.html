This whole discussion is begining to remind me of Godel's Theorem.  (i.e. any
sufficiently powerful axiomatic system is inconsistent, or something like
that.)  Given that no "perfect" mathematical set of rules exists, why should
we expect that a "perfect" (i.e. non-trivial but completely consistent) set
of game rules should exist?

Come to think of it, one way to win in Nomic is to be unable to complete
one's move (in essence, to find an inconsistency in the rules).

i like this line, that's a favorite book of mine, 4 feet away infact,
....we could state it as

 <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Matt's_Theorem<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>:
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The system of rules for any non-trivial game, including purely abstract |
| games, must contain at least one defect.                                |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

so, for example, my 5-in-a-row game on a hexgrid, with only 3 directions
to make the 5-in-a-row, must be "trivial", since the rules are but 2 and
are:
         1) each player takes turns placing a new stone of their
            color upon an unoccupied hexpoint.

         2) the game is ended and won by the first player to
            make 5-in-a-row in any of the 3 possible directions.

so even though i have no idea what the triviality is, i can take umbrage
in the Theorem that it must exist.  or...is there a defect in the rules?

the board size i've used is 10 on a side for 271 points, but 11 (331) is
probably safer to avoid the Defect of the finite board size.  what if
11 isnt safe?  infinite board, use a computer to pan over it....

ok - infinite board, no edge effects...is there a defect?  if not, does
that imply triviality?

what do you think of the Theorem?  boulderdash, right?  :-)
