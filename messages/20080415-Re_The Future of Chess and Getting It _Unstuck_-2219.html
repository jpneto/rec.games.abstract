Oh? I see it cited all the time. But it was very interesting to learn

also been used to balance Go.

Perhaps it is just that my reading about Go has mostly been in older
books, whereas <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, a recent innovation, is discussed in newer
books and articles about Go.

I have been thinking further about this matter, and have come up with
something I call "Temporary Marsellais Chess", or simply "Balanced
Chess", described at the end of the page on my site at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.quadibloc.com/chess/ch0101.htm">http://www.quadibloc.com/chess/ch0101.htm</a>

Begin by playing Balanced Marsellais Chess, with the additional rule
that a piece may not be moved twice in a turn, but switch to normal
Chess at the first check.

(There is also an additional rule for captures; perhaps the switch to
normal Chess might be made at the first check or capture instead.)

Partial credit is given for bare King and stalemate.

By precisely equalizing Black and White, and making the margin of
insufficient material to force a win as narrow as possible, I illustrate
a way in which it might be attempted to obtain the results for Chess
that the use of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> has obtained for Go. Of course, with two
moves per turn for part of the game, this is still a new game, not a
minor tweak to Chess.
