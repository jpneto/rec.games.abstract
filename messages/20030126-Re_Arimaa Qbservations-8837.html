Thanks for the reply, David. You've provided lots of fascinating information
for me to look into. You blew my mind when you mentioned using cellular
automata for influence in go!

I know that just the chance of getting $10,000 for all the work that would
be required for the Arimaa challenge is not much (though it might well be
much for the person who is offering it - I find it intesting that he is
making the challenge). Still, it's not much for any potential competitors
either. If you're fiddling with some Arimaa AI anyway, it might not be much
more work to come up with something you could submit. It would be
interesting to see an approach like yours take the prize.
