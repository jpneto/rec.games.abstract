Look how Luis was really angry to see a known crappy designer inspired by Carteso :

"Nice to see other designers being inspired by our game.

Captures can be added to Carteso in many different ways, of course. I think my first instinct would have been to try Go captures or a tailored version of them. For instance, you could have a Carteso variant with this additional rule:

On their turn, instead of placing a stone, a player can flip a tied group with no liberties, provided that the resulting group isn't itself tied."

How I read it. Hey Rel Alicea you did not invent nothing and it is easy to create a variant of Carteso including capture. Ha ha ha here Nice to see means fuck you guy! 
How this guy is without any doubt big hypocrite! 
Not only he is plagiarizing my idea but now he made m idea his own idea as if he was the real creator.
Luis and Clark atajo de ladrones!!!
