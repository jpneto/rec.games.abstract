More of a Tripen variant since the "trapezium-shaped pieces" are really the asymmetric game tokens I published here a day earlier, adapted from a hex board to a square board.  I did't see any mention of me or Tripen in the rule sheet.

Flippy games are a cop out.  It's an easy way to prevent draws.  Where's the challenge?

This shit approaches Symple on the complexity scale.

"Two like-colored pieces are weakly connected if they touch each other by a vertex only, and strongly connected if they touch each other by at least part of an edge longer than a vertex."

"Flip one enemy piece such that the full length of its two longest sides is adjacent to one or more friendly pieces and at least one of its other two sides is orthogonally adjacent to an empty space."

What??

Whoever thinks you're king of the hill doesn't realize you're running off with my ideas and creating way complicated flippy games, Luis.
