There's a version of this game under the name "solitaire" in the Modula-3
distribution.  I have it running on my Sun.  There are definitely unwinnable
positions.  The Modula-3 implementation includes a feature where you can ask
it if a position is winnable.  (You can also ask it to show you the first
move of a winning sequence, but I don't do that.)  This feature does have the
unfortunate property that, if over-used, it makes the game go too quickly.
I.e., you can ask and find that you've reached an unwinnable position, then
back up a few moves and ask again, etc.

Incidentally, the Modula-3 version enforces one rule that Gregory didn't
mention, so I don't know if it's in the Mac version or not.  To wit: If you
get an empty space in the tableau (i.e., one of the 10 columns goes empty),
then ONLY a King can be moved into that space.

I've also seen a PC-clone version, with somewhat different rules.  I forget
all the details, but I think it used alternating colors for building in the
tableau (but still in suit for building up on the Aces).  In the version where
both places build strictly in suit, there's never any reason not to move cards
onto the Aces piles whenever possible.  In the PC version that's not the case.
