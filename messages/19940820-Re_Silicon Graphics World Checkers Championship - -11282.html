   Too bad the Chinook team doesn't have such sportsmanship.  IMO the match
should have been declared a draw with the champion retaining his title until
his health improved enough for a rematch.  Tinsley gave you guys every
possible break, and IMO you're just taking advantage of his overdeveloped
sense of fair play.  Guess that's just another area where machines are
superior, they don't suffer from that human weakness.

This is totally uncalled for.  From what I know of Jonathan, he must be
feeling awful at this point that the match cannot continue, and now we have
some wise ass accusing him of being a cheat.  The guy has been working his
butt out for many years to play THE best, and given Tinsley's current
uncertain health (he is hospitalized at the moment), there is some
possibility that Tinsley might not be in condition to play another match
in the future.  It is sad that the two great adversaries cannot continue
the struggle against each other.  It would be tragic if there cannot be
a rematch.  I hope that it never comes to that, and Tinsley regains his full
strength, both mental and physical, for another showdown.

You owe Jonathan and the Chinook team a public apology.
