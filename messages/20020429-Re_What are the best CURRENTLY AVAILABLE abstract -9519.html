On the GIPF games, I recommend Zertz most highly. It is wonderfully
original and can go so many ways. I guess that's what I like about it
is it is so fluid. But the whole GIPF project is well worth mentioning.

Blokus is also very good, but they may be out of business. Their
website is gone.

Siesta is an excellent game that got a bad rep because of poorly
written rules. But it is a wonderful game where you have Suns, Roofs
and shadow tiles. You score for having the longest shadow coming off
your roof. Published by Goldsieber/Rio Grande

I'll second the recomdation on Octi.

Quoridor is a good game. You each are moving a pawn across a board
where you can move or erect a wall to create a straight path for
yourself or a maze for your opponant. Great American Trading Company /
Gigamic <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gigamic.com/jeuxanglais/quoridore.htm">http://www.gigamic.com/jeuxanglais/quoridore.htm</a>

Funagain calls flowerpower an abstract so I'll recommend it. A very
pleasent two player where you plant flower tiles into your field and a
neutral field to maximum advantage and weeds into your opponant's field
to block them. Published by Kosmos. They are a German publisher so try
boardgame geek (see below) for more information. Ir Funagain games

Abalone is definitely worth looking at. A game of pushing marbles to
capture them. Very popular.

M is a very interesting tile-laying game. Published by Abacus.

Traverse is an excellent game where pieces move chinese-checkers like
based on the shape (square, triangle, circle and diamond). Traverse
should be a classic that is in every home but it has never been
marketed to the best advantage. Published by Educational Insights

Billabong is a very nice game where players race chinese checkers like
around a circular track. Published by Amigo.

Carat published by Queen is an interesting tile-laying game.

Meander is not cheap, around $75, but it is an extremely clever game of
laying grooved tiles so your marbles roll to a good spot and your
opponant's marvles roll into the gutter. Published by De Speelstijl.

5ive Straight is a very clever turn on pente where players are playing
into holes numbered 0-99 by playing cards with numbers. You can play on
that number or higher. Played singally or in pairs, 2-6 can play (ecept
for 5) Published by Straight Line Products. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.5straight.com/">http://www.5straight.com/</a>

Bailiwick, a new game from R&amp;R Games and due in May looks very
interesting. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rnrgames.com/content/products/bailiwick.php">http://www.rnrgames.com/content/products/bailiwick.php</a>

Hive is a very interesting new chess-like game, You have different
insects that can move differently and you ate trying to surround the
opponant's queen. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.hivemania.com/">http://www.hivemania.com/</a>

For a card game, I like Drahtseilakt. Published by ASS (German
publisher, must mean something else over there) A nice number game
where you try to win red points and blue points equally. Themed as a
tight-roap walker.

I highly recommend you check out <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/</a> as well
as the spielfrieks discussion group at Yahoo groups. Both are great
sources for information.
