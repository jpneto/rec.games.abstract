I only found some minor problems. Laska was spelled Lasca which adds to
the confusion that already tortures us. I also doubt the spelling of
Bashne (often called Bashni). The name of this game is Russian and means
"tower". The last letter is pronounced between 'e' and 'a' und the
official transcription (as explained in the introductions of my Russian
dictionaries and text books) is 'a' !!!!!
So I assume that it should be written "Bashna"? Is there anybody
who has studied Russian?

My Russian is very rusty, but I gather from the online dictionaries and
grammars that this
is a first declension masculine (Bashn'a), which would make the transcribed
plural Bashni, and I think
that would be the name of the game. Perhaps the 'e' comes from an older form
of the plural? Any native
Russian speakers?
