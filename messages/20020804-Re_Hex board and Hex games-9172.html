I forgot about the fixed board.

Admittedly, this is based on a single playing of the German version of the
game three years ago, but:

1. The event cards are too varied in power.  Some of the cards are
screw-your-opponent disaster cards, some of the cards are
specific-recovery-from-specific-disaster cards, and some give varying combat
bonuses.  I ended up having cards that let me avoid a flood, cross a river,
and climb trees to avoid predators.  One of the other players ended up with
all combat bonus cards.  When my 3 cavemen crossed the river, his 3 cavemen
suddenly had huge bonuses to kill my cavemen.  I had tried to do something
moderately clever, but it didn't matter, because it all came down to the +3
bonus to his d6 roll.  Ouch!

2.  The "cavewomen are chattel" mechanic means I could never trot this one
out in my own home.

3.  Ooh, yeah, the board felt really cramped.  I think we were playing a
5-player game, and I was the first to be eliminated.

4.  The fact that there are so few units means you have to try and eke every
possible advantage out of each combat.  After working really hard to keep
the cavemen alive throughout the winter, it was a real downer to lose them
either to a bad roll of the dice, or being outnumbered by one more caveman.
