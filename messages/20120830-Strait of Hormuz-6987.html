STRAIT OF HORMUZ

Worlds most arbitrary game.  Untested.  Incoherent babbling.

36x36 grid, two or more players, each with their own color of stones,
two dice.

Start your turn with a roll of the dice.

MINE ACTIVITY
The first thing the dice determine is what happens with enemy mines.
More on this later.

After the mines have been exploded, deleted, or left there where they
are, you have the choice of adding vessels (lines or double lines of
stones), or shooting from existing vessels.

Patrol - 2
Frigate - 3
Submarine - 4
Destroyer - 5
Cruiser - 6
Battleship - double line of 5 (counts as 5 for calculations)
Aircraft carrier - double line of 6 (counts as 6 for calculations)

Mine - 1 (singleton)

VESSEL PLACEMENT EXAMPLES
Roll a (2,3).  You can add a patrol and a frigate, each oriented N-S,
E-W, NW-SE, or NE-SW.
Roll a (5,5): add one battleship (double line of 5 stones - 10 total).
Roll a (6,6): add one AC (double line of 6 stones - 12 total).

Friendly vessels can't touch each other.

LETHALITY
A larger vessel can destroy a smaller vessel by hitting any part of
it.  A smaller vessel can only destroy a larger vessel by hitting the
center of it (center = 1, 2, or 4 stones, depending on type of
vessel).

BLOCKING
Direct shots are blocked by intervening, equal or larger vessels.

Patrol boats through cruisers can only shoot directly forward or
backward, from any point on the ship.  Battleships and ACs can shoot
in any direction, from any point on the ship.

SHOOTING EXAMPLES
Roll a (5,3).  You can use a destroyer to kill an unobstructed (by an
equal or larger vessel) smaller enemy vessel, any point of which is 3
units away, and in line with any point on the destroyer.  Or you can
use a battleship to do the same except in any direction, not
necessarily in line with the battleship.  Or you can use a frigate to
kill a larger vessel, the center of which is 5 units away, and in
line.  Or you can use a frigate to kill a patrol, either point of
which is 5 units away.

Roll a (4,5).  You can use a submarine to kill a larger unobstructed
vessel, the center of which 5 units away from any point on the
submarine, and in line with the submarine.

LAUNCHING A MINE
Same obstruction and lethality rules apply as with shooting.  If you
don't have a direct hit available, you can launch a mine close to an
enemy vessel.  On your opponent's turn, if he rolls a (1,X), your
mines explode with a range of X, killing only enemy vessels within
that range.  Exploded mines are then removed from the board.  If he
rolls an odd total, your mines remain in place.  If he rolls an even
total, your mines disappear without exploding.  Vessels and friendly
mines can destroy enemy mines (which were not exploded or deleted at
the beginning of your turn).  A mine can destroy multiple enemy
vessels and enemy mines.

PLACEMENT PROXIMITY
You can't add small vessels too close to larger opposing vessels.  The
larger vessels must have an opportunity to add intervening, friendly,
blocking vessels.

The minimum distance between closest points on opposing vessels when
placing a smaller vessel is determined by the difference in vessel
size, with destroyers and ACs counting as size 5 and 6 respectively.
So for example, you can't place a patrol closer than 4 units away from
a cruiser or an AC.  You can't place a frigate closer than 3 units
away from a destroyer or a battleship.

AIR DROP
If you roll a double (1,1), (2,2),... (6,6), you have the option of
dropping a mine anywhere, subject to a minimum placement distance
equal to the dice.  E.g. If you roll a (1,1) you can place a mine at
minimum right next to an enemy vessel of any size, or at maximum, 6
units away from an enemy vessel.  If you roll a (4,4) you can only
place the mine as close as 4 units away from an enemy vessel.
