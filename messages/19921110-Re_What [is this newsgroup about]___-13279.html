Rec.games.abstract is for games of pure strategy which have no existing
newsgroup.  Pure strategy implies no hidden knowledge and no element of
chance.  Thus, by way of example, Othello and Pente are two that satisfy
both criteria.  Chess and Go do as well, but they have existing groups.

Within my experience, having a probabilistic rather than absolute set of rules
does not destroy the strategic element, but rather changes it.  Creating
optimal strategy differs between situations where the rules are always the same
and where the rules are not always the same.

My memory of the charter is rather fuzzy, but where I saw it (rec.games.design)
was from discussions among game players who play strategy games that have a
random element as well as deterministic strategy games.

If people want to just discuss strategy games with deterministic rules, go
ahead, but there are games that involve randomness and are not "Well, I'll just
trust to me luck and see what happens".  In some ways, randomness adds
considerably to the strategic complexity of games.

(keep in mind that the original application of strategy - warfare - is
something that has a considerable random element, and is still very much
intelligence based in approach)
