Here is a squared grid 9x9 stars where the stars are equidistant orthogonally :

* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *

An isosceles triangle has 3 vertices with the equal side of length l
Each time you draw an isosceles triangle you remove 3 stars from the grid above as each vertex overlap a star.

Examples :

/ * * / * * / * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * / * * * /
/ * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *

The isosceles triangle (A1,A4,D1) removes 3 stars (A1,A4,D1)
The isosceles triangle (G1,E3,I3) removes 3 stars (G1,E3,I3)

The goal of the puzzle is :
- to remove all the stars by drawing 27 iscosceles triangles (27*3=81)
- the 27 iscosceles triangles MUST BE distinct. Distinct means that 2 isosceles triangles are distinct as long as their equal side are of different length l.
To be clear : 2 isosceles triangles are equivalent even if their third side (the unequal one) is distinct.

Can you find at least one solution?

This puzzle gave birth to many of my abstract games most of them unpublished.

The puzzle was solved by someone who used a program and he posted one solution. According to him there are "many thousands of solutions".

I will post a new one soon.
Keep in mind that each puzzle I create means 1000 abstract games are waiting to be born.
Not all the puzzles give birth to abstract games. My puzzles are designed for such goal.
