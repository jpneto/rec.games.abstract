<br>&nbsp;;-)&nbsp; on one level, all games are abstract...but
<br>&nbsp;in this case, this group, rec.games.abstract, has
<br>&nbsp;chosen to narrow their subject down to the kind of
<br>&nbsp;games like go or chess or othello or even tic-tac-toe
<br>&nbsp;variations.&nbsp; while go &amp; chess have plenty of discussion
<br>&nbsp;within their own groups, some other abstract games
<br>&nbsp;are not given a group of their own.&nbsp; that is what this
<br>&nbsp;group is for.&nbsp; when a new abstract game hits the scene,
<br>&nbsp;this group can then dissect it.&nbsp; it is a good clearing
<br>&nbsp;house for finding where to get these games, what is
<br>&nbsp;cool about them, what is defective, what is stolen and
<br>&nbsp;transmogrified, and so on.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there are no elements of chance in abstract games.
<br>&nbsp;there is no hidden information in abstract games.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;also, the very term "abstract" is colored with the
<br>&nbsp;notion that the playing board and/or pieces are
<br>&nbsp;reduced to skeletal abstractions of whatever reality
<br>&nbsp;they may have been inspired by.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;role-playing games, particularily the gazillions of
<br>&nbsp;games inspired by the Tolkein books, do the reverse.
<br>&nbsp;they attempt to reconstruct a sense of reality of
<br>&nbsp;being in the story yourself - a fine goal, but not
<br>&nbsp;applicable to rec.games.abstract.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there used to be a FAQ somewhere.....
