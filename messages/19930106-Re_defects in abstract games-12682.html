In practice RPS is less complex than chess or go because it is easy to find
a strategy which guarentees doing as well as your opponent on average.
However in a sense it is a more complicated game because there is hidden
information. In chess and go "all" you have to do is look at the game trees
to figure out what you should do for perfect play. That won't work with RPS
since each "pure" strategy can be countered by a better "pure" strategy.
You need to use a "mixed" strategy to guarentee that you will break even on
average. This is a quality missing from perfect information games, like chess
and go.
