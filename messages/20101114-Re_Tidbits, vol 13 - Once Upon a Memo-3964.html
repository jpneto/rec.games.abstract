Some quotes from fake newsgroup, recre.games.combinatorial:

????  What happened to all the anti Mark Steere comments ????  I couldn't
find a single one !!!!!!  I guess that's one of the perks of a fake
newsgroup.  You can go back and erase shit that you're now embarrassed
about.  Can't do that here, Bill.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
All the posts here are now bile-related.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Bill, don't look now, but your "Woe is me / Mark the Destroyer / Everyone
run for your lives" campaign has already burned itself out.  For one thing,
Bill, you've personally spewed as much bile here as anyone.  The glaring
hypocrisy of that undermines your tale of woe.

Remember your spam attack from a couple days ago?:

"=================================================
Members of the Public, in particular, ABSTRACT GAMERS
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This group is now defunct, and useless as a games forum.

You are requested not to make serious games posts here,
but to direct them instead to     Recre.Games.Combinatorial ,
where the only requirement for posts is that writers maintain
a civil, non-insulting attitude to other users.

**
Recre.Games.Combinatorial                          **
================================================="

Bill, spam is the tool of the ignorant.  Why was a university professor
wielding spam?  Btw, why the sudden reprieve?  Could it be that you've
publicly embarrassed yourself?  The overwhelming consensus of distancing
from you by your own colleagues at the University of Canterbury speaks
volumes.  Here's one from colleague, professor Ben Martin:

==================================================
Hi Mark,

I have passed your message on to our Head of Department.

Regards, Ben
==================================================

That was the most innocuous one of the bunch.  Would it surprise you to
learn that some of your colleagues are less than enthused with you right
now, Bill?  Maybe I should just post all the responses.  I think that would
be instructive.

Jeez, Wondering Willy, do you think it might have anything to do with you?
