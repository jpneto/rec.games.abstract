I don't know. Maybe not for the money. Only an idiot would
commercialize boardgames, abstract games especially, for the money,
since it's such an abysmal way to chase gold coins (low margins, tiny
upside, small market). It's like going into mathematics for the sex.
Although, thinking about the way Nestor's productions work, maybe his
margins are better than average. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure
his buyer base is small, or at least too small for anyone (idiots
excepted) whose main goal is money.

It's probably some personal fulfillment thing. If I ever commercialize
a game, it will be strictly for my ego. I assume others are the same.

blah blah pointless speculation I must be bored.
