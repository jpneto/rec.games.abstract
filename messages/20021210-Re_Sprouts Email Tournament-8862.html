<br><blockquote type=cite>In all the abstract games which I enjoy, you can play so as to try to
<br>improve your position.
<br>
<br>In sprouts, either you are able to analyse the position fully (when
<br>either you know that you have a won position, or you know that your
<br>opponent has a won position but you can hope that he goes wrong), or you
<br>can't and the move that you make might as well be random.
<br>
<br>Can you persuade me otherwise?
<br></blockquote>
<br>That's a great summary of the old view of sprouts.&nbsp; I remember many
<br>years ago at a chess tournament the math professor David Sumner
<br>expressed exactly the same idea.&nbsp; Lately, though, the concept of
<br>"survivors" has given the game a strong strategical element.&nbsp; A
<br>survivor is a live spot in an exhausted position.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I don't see how this provides any strategical element at all.&nbsp; I stand 
by my statement - either I can calculate the full value of the position 
(and it is then trivial knowing what move to make), or I can't, and I 
have no reason to prefer any move over any other.&nbsp; I would say this of 
any impartial game.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>A live spot is either a "cannibal" or a "ghost".&nbsp; A cannibal is a live
<br>spot with 0 or two lines attached.&nbsp; A ghost is a live spot with one
<br>line attached.
<br>Any sprouts move must change a position with an even number of
<br>cannibals to a position with an odd number of cannibals, and vice
<br>versa.&nbsp; Since a survivor is a cannibal, the player to move in any
<br>position can count the number of cannibals and instantly know whether
<br>he needs an even or an odd number of survivors in the final position.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Using nim notation, a cannibal is equal to 0, a ghost is equal to *. The 
number of cannibals in a position is irrelevant, as each cannibal 
provides either no move, or a move for each player.&nbsp; If you are going to 
move to a position with nothing but cannibals and ghosts, and you can 
arrange for the number of ghosts to be even, you win by doing so;&nbsp; and 
if you make it odd, you lose by doing so.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Play revolves around trying to get an even or an odd number of
<br>survivors.&nbsp; As the position gets more and more divided up, players try
<br>to extract desirable numbers of survivors from different sections of
<br>the position.
<br></blockquote>
<br>But they don't know which of odd and even is desirable, unless they can 
evaluate the whole game.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Often there will be a position or subposition in which
<br>one player will try to maximize the number of survivors and the other
<br>player will try to minimize the number of survivors.
<br></blockquote>
<br>The number of survivors is irrelevant.&nbsp; It is the number of ghosts (*s) 
that matters, and it is only the parity of this number that is of 
interest, not its size.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Sometimes there
<br>will be cases in which a player succeeds too well, minimizes or
<br>maximizes too much.&nbsp; There is a lot of room for experience and
<br>intuition in estimating and trying to influence how many survivors a
<br>position or subposition will yield.
<br>
<br>A surprisingly useful notion is the concept of a "universal trap" or
<br>UT.&nbsp; A UT is a subposition consisting of two communicating spots, each
<br>with 0 lines attached, and such that either (1) neither spot
<br>communicates with any other spot or (2) both spots communicate with
<br>one other spot, a spot with two lines attached and which itself
<br>communicates with at least one more spot.&nbsp; We generally try not to
<br>move to a UT because the second person to move to a UT can determine
<br>whether the UT will yield an even or an odd number of survivors.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Do you mean "we generally try not to move <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>in<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a UT"?&nbsp; This would make 
sense, as the only move in a UT is to *2.
<br>
<br>UT (1) has the value {*2|*2}, which is equal to 0.&nbsp; This means that, 
with competent play, it might as well not exist.&nbsp; But if you can't 
evaluate the position and you think that your opponent may be able to, 
it is a good idea to avoid moving in a UT (1), as it increases your 
opponent's options.&nbsp; (It also increases your own options, but this is no 
use to you while you can't evaluate the position.)
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>These ideas and some related ideas explained on the website
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.geocities.com/chessdp">www.geocities.com/chessdp</a> help make the game a lot of fun to play from
<br>the first move on.&nbsp; Various rules of thumb give the player a good
<br>strategical orientation immediately, and he is able to make
<br>meaningful, goal-oriented moves.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Would you say the same about nim?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>In the kind of position which you describe in which a player knows he
<br>is lost, it's the same as in chess.&nbsp; If the player knows his opponent
<br>has the technique and knowledge to certainly win, he resigns.
<br>Otherwise he tries to make problems for his opponent, using strategy
<br>and tactics.&nbsp; But most of sprouts play occurs in difficult, unclear
<br>positions.&nbsp; One player or the other invariably resigns long before the
<br>position is exhausted.&nbsp; Beginners are often amazed how early
<br>resignation comes.&nbsp; In fact, resignation usually comes long before
<br>meaningful, nonrandom play would have even begun in the old days
<br>before the survivor concept.
<br>
<br>I hope this diatribe has been a reasonable answer to your question!
