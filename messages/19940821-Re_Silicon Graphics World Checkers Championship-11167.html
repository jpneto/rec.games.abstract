|&gt; &gt;That's correct, unless Tinsley can already play perfectly.  Actually he

|&gt; &gt;avoid making a game-losing mistake during the course of the match.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Assuming checkers is drawn with best play, is there a meaningful difference
|&gt; between a perfect strategy and one that never loses?
|&gt; 
We have discussed this thread for chess software at our chess club.
Under two assumptions:
1) A program solves the chess game (This does not mean, it generates all
   possible moves in the momentary game tree!)
2) The game is a draw with perfect play
we found, that the perfect program, which only is interested in the best
momentary result gets a lower result against relatively bad players
(mostly remis, some wins), than todays imperfect programs. As there
is in real no best move (only maximal three classes of moves), a really
good program has to find the move in the best class, which makes it most
likely for the opponent to make a result-changing error.

For checkers this is even true. chinook 2000 has to choose the move, which
most likely gives Tinsley the opportunity to fail.
