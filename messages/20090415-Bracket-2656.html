Bracket

This one is just an idea.  I haven't played it, or even thought it
through terribly much.  Could be broken.  Opinions solicited.

The idea is to "Bracket" groups of your opponents stones, by touching
a group of oppenent's stones with groups of your own which are both
larger and smaller than it.

For two players, played with black and white stones on a hexagonal
tiling.  I don't know what the optimal board shape/size will be yet.

Player 1 owns the black stones and player 2 owns the white.

1.  Board begins empty.
2.  Starting with black, players take turns putting a stone onto any
empty space.
3.  Game ends when board is full.
4.  Player with the higher score wins, with scores calculated as
follows:

A.  Player 1's score is the number of stones in the largest <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>white<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
group touching at least one black group containing fewer stones than
it, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one black group containing more stones than it.

B.  Player 2's score is the number of stones in the largest <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>black<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
group touching at least one white group containing fewer stones than
it, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one white group containing more stones than it.

C.  If the scores are tied by this measure, then compare the second
largest white and black groups, respectively, and so on.

D.  If the groups are tied all the way down the line, it's a draw.


It's possible that this will place too much emphasis on having the
largest group on the board.  If so, perhaps this alternative scoring
system will work:

A.  Player 1's score is the number of stones in the smallest <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>white<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
group touching at least one black group containing fewer stones than
it, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one black group containing more stones than it.

B. Player 2's score is the number of stones in the smallest <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>black<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
group touching at least one white group containing fewer stones than
it, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one white group containing more stones than it.

C. If the scores are tied by this measure, then compare the second
smallest white and black groups, respectively, and so on.

D. If the groups are tied all the way up the line, it's a draw.

This might lead to cold wars, however.  Not sure.
