"When you see a good move, look for a better one" -Emanual Lasker

"One doesn't have to play well, it's enough to play better than your
opponent" -Siegbert Tarrasch

"One of these modest little moves may be more embarrassing to your
opponent than the biggest threat" -Siegbert Tarrasch (on strategy vs
tactics)
"I look one move ahead... the best!" -Jose Raul Capablanca

"When you don't know what to play, wait for an idea to come into your
opponent's mind. You may be sure that idea will be wrong"-Siegbert
Tarrasch

"First-class players lose to second-class players because second-class
players sometimes play a first-class game" -Siegbert Tarrasch

"Up to this point White has been following well-known analysis. But
now he makes a fatal error: he begins to use his own head"  -Siegbert
Tarrasch

"Why must i lose to this idiot!" -Aron Nimzowitch

"I had a toothache during the first game. In the second game I had a
headache. In the third game it was an attack of rheumatism. In the
fourth game, I wasn't feeling well. And in the fifth game? Well, must
one have to win every game?-Siegbert Tarrasch

"I have looked through your game, and I find but little in it. At one
time, played by gentlemen, it might have been worth practising; but it
is now kicked out from the drawing-room to the ante-chamber; and my
soul is above the place of lacqueys. In three months I have become
your equal, in three months more I could give you a pawn; but I
renounce the pursuit, and bid you farewell. I shall never play
draughts again!" -Alexandre Louis Honore Lebreton Deschapelles

"As long as the equilibrium is maintained, an attack, however skilful,
cannot succeed against correct defence. Such a defence will eventually
necessitate the withdrawal and regrouping of the attacking pieces and
te attacker will then inevitably suffer disadvantage" -William
Steinitz (on premature attack in games that are theoretically drawn)

"A player can win only as a consequence of an error made by the
opponent" -William Steinitz (applies to all wins by players without
the theoretical win)

"A knowledge of tactics is the foundation of positional play"- Richard
Reti

"Life is fundamentally futile and great games are a tribute to
precisely that." -Christian Freeling

"Opinions are difficult because they're too damn easy." -Christian
Freeling

"Having thoughts is not the same as thinking" -Christian Freeling

unfortunetly shogi proverbs are too specific to be tossed around as
general proverbs.
There was also a really good mark steere quote somewhere on RGA, but i
couldn't find it.
Also, some of these are quotes not well suited for proverbs, but still
contain some wisdom.
