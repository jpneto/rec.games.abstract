I don't think the developer went out of his way to make a crappy

Zillions ot get publicity.

Well I had to go out of my way just to get Zillions to gobble the
rules file without crashing :-)  So just getting the rules into
Zillions was a challenge.  Im really not in any position to 
optimize the rules for the Zillions AI engine; I know next to
nothing about how it works.  If anyone would like to try 
making the rules better give it a shot.  You could test your
rules file against mine to see which plays better.  But in the
end I don't think it will make that much of a difference.  The
main thing that makes games difficult for conventional AI is
the average branching factor (after a players turn how many new 
positions can arise from the current position) of the game.
The branching factor of Chess is about 30; Go is about 300; 
Arimaa is about 20,000.  Well my whole reason for creating
Arimaa was to try and max out this number using a chess set
and keeping the game humanly playable.

I did not port Arimaa to Zillions after the fact.  I used Zillions
while I was developing the rules.  When I began working on the
rules for Arimaa back in Jan 1999 I did not know about Zillions
and so I used to use a real chess set to test out new rules
by playing games against myself (before trying it with others).
In April 1999 I came across the zillions-of-games.com site and
immediately bought it and started coding the rules in Zillions.
It did not play well at all (which is what I expected due to the
high branching factor).  But it really did not matter because
Zillions is still a very useful tool even if it can't play the game.
It was great because I did not have to manually record the games
anymore to save them and I could now easily step back and
forth through the moves to take back moves and try different 
moves.  The network interface it has was also very helpful
since I could now play others on the LAN.  It does not work
if your behind a firewall, but even still Keith Carter and I
used to email the zillions move list to each other to play
postal games.  It really is a very useful tool for anyone
working on new game rules.

I just think that the folks who wrote Zillions are the likely
best implementers of the games rules that it runs, because they are fully
conversant with the capabilities of the engine.

I'm not sure about this.  I think that some third parties, like Peter Aronson,
Karl Scherer, Jens Markmann, and others, have done an awful lot of ZRF
scripting and game-playing and have implemented some wickedly complex games
brilliantly, things that far exceed the games Zillions ships with or even what
the developers thought possible, in all likelihood.

When I first started coding in zillions, I was really having
a hard time with the pushing and pulling rules.  I posted for
help in the Zillions forums.  I was fortunate to have Jens Markmann 
help me get started with Zillions by actually sending me a .zrf with
some of the rules I needed help with.  I would like to publicly
thank Jens for doing that, otherwise I was almost about to give
up on Zillions thinking its language could not handle those rules.
