This is the first time I post on the group. I am looking for a game called
"load runner". I believe it is a very very old game (at lest as old as
APPLE IIe or IIc). Also has pc version.
I asked most of peopel around. But they either gave me the wrong one or just
know nothing about it.  I tried to use Archie, but still fail.
The game basically talking about a little figure collecting some colored
boxes(namly treasures), And serveral( normally 3) chasers are trying to catch
that little figure. That little man can dig holes to trap those chasers. ( some
time dose that in order to get some treasures embedded by wall).  This game has
totally 50+ episodes.
That is all I remember. I miss that game so much. Please drop me a mail or post
if you know that game ( it most likely  has another name). or any clue about it.

I have this game on the Apple IIe.  It is one of the best game ever.  It has
lots of levels and gets really fast at the harder levels.  I even have the
construction set where you can build your own maze.  This game needed a lot
of thinking and timing or you might get stuck when the blocks start to reform.
As I remember there were more chaser than 3, atleast 5 to 8 or even more.  I
don't remember they were collecting colored boxes though because I have a
green monochrome monitor.
