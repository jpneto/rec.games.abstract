For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.

I prefer a relatively analysable, but essentially random
game.  One of my favorite board games is Settlers of Catan.
The rules are simple and elegant, which makes it very
amenable to analysis.  However, the random element keeps
things casual enough that you can't (and thus don't have to)
look many turns in advance.

For me, Chess is not fun.  Because it's possible to look
ahead many moves, there's intense pressure to do so.
However, the extent to which you can look ahead is not
humanly comfortable.

I prefer a game which is predictable and analyzable enough
so you can look ahead a bit--but not so far ahead that
your head hurts just thinking about it.  I think the only
ways to acheive this are essentially random elements
(si-move and secret information count, because they
usually lead to essentially random strategies).

My personal peeve is random turn order.  In a lot of games,
the players move their pieces in a random order each turn.
This utterly destroys any ability to look ahead even 1 turn.
The inevitable result is a game too shallow for my tastes.

On the other hand, two of my other favorite board games
are Wiz War and Robo Rally.  These games are nearly
impossible to analyze globally because your options
are defined by your cards--which are picked randomly.
The whole point behind these games is to cobble together
a makeshift plan based on whatever you get--and then
to laugh maniacally as those plans go awry!
