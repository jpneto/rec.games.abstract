Here's one more argument for eliminating the stalemate draw (and other draws)
from the game of International Chess. The less draws there are in high level
chess, the more popular Chess will become.

Nobody, pro, amatuer, casual player or lay spectator, likes to see a draw,
especially on the tournament level, and even on individual games. 
In the recent speed chess competition, a messy, ugly and unfair tiebreaker 
system was used. White gets 6 minutes to mate Black with 5 minutes or lose; 
all draws are a win for Black. Apparently, Black nearly always wins, so the 
winner of the event ends up being determined by a coin flip. If this keeps 
up there will be hoards of chess books with whole chapters on coin flip 
technique! (SSWDNNSS!*) I seems so strange to me that this totally arbitrary 
and unworkable tie break can be used in a tournament, but we can not change 
the sacred stalemate rule.

The point here is, if you want get rid of draws, just get rid of them!
It's up for grabs whether stalemate should be defined as a win or loss
for the player who gives it -- either way would be a better game. Or you 
can just <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not allow<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a move that gives stalemate. Historically, all three
of these rules have been used, and the stalemate as a draw is a relitively
recent experiment -- a failed one! Yes, changing the rules would make it 
a different game -- a better one. But the world standings wouldn't change 
one bit!

And don't stop there. Dump perpetual check and the fifty move rule. I
don't think you'd have to dump draws by agreement, but they may end up being
less likely, especialy if the time limits are reduced somewhat. But if not, 
get rid of those also! I might stop short in eliminating draws by 
insufficient force, so there will still probably be some/a few/plenty draws 
for those of you who love them. But I'd love to see a completely drawproof 
game. The cleanest way might be to disallow all draws  -- stalemate, 
perpetual check, draw by agreement, even insufficient force! -- and have an 
absolute time limit on the game so one player will eventually run out of time.
When the players realize that neither will be able to force checkmate, they
will look at the clock and the play with the least time will resign. This
is a radical idea, I know. I'm just saying.

As far as a win by stalemate not being 'as good as checkmate', well
if you win a tournament by 12.5 points or by a half a point, you still get
the trophy, the title and all the cash.

Nearly all sports are played differently in high level events compared to 
casual 'just us friends' games. Plenty of Little League games end tied, but
when was the last time you saw a World Series end in a draw? I'm gonna go out
on a limb here, but I believe that whatever possible detriment to the game of
chess eliminating all or most draws would have would be more than balanced by  
the renewed interest to the public. People don't like ties, especially long
strings of them. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it true that
both Shogi and Go rarely end in draw but they manage to $upport a larger 
number of professional players than international chess (proportional to 
their player base)? (Ok, maybe I'm stretching.)

When I play chess at my level, it just don't matter. And nothing's stopping
you from playing using the rules as they stand. But at championship 
level, we dont need no draws! In the Olympics, they use touchpads to measure
times in the swimming competition to nearly meaningless thousandths of a 
second. When I swam in high school, the timekeeper was some 10th grader with 
a Cassio wristwatch. In response to too many gymnasts scoring perfect 10's, 
they cranked up the skills required and judged them to another decimal place. 
I know of no other international competitions that have as many draws -- well, 
except for checkers and I think we can all agree on how exciting a checkers
competition is!



Here is some historical info to back up the idea of eliminating as many 
draws as possible:

According to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Chess Variations<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by John Gollon:
