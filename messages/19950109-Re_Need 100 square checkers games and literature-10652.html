An excellent book to get on a variety of games is R. Wayne
Schmittberger's  <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>New Rules for Classic Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.  I saw it once at Barnes
&amp; Noble in the Bargain section for $5.  (Every gamer should own this
book, if only for ideas that can be applied for other games.)

I t includes rules for wide variety games  (From chess variants to
"kickball Golf").  There are 3 excellent chapters on chess, checkers and
backgammon.   There are many great games that involve making a board or
other easily improvised equipment.

This is a rules book, not a strategy guide.  As for strategy, there are
many checkers variants ( each country seems to have a different one), so any
strategy guide for say Spanish checkers won't necessarily apply to any
other others.  But good luck on your search.

I don't like disclaimers, but I have to put them in.  The opinions here
are my own and not necessarily PG&amp;E's.
(As if it had any opinions about this stuff!)
