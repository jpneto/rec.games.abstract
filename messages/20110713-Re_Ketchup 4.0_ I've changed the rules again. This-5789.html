but Ketchup isn't the kind of game that easily
allows memorizing openings (if at all). It hasn't the low branch
density that a game needs for that. Moreover, Chess and Draughts have
opening theory, which is part of their lasting appeal. The point being
that the possibility of memorizing openings isn't necessarily a bad
thing.

Any fixed game will eventually turn into a memorized opening
situation.  No matter how long it takes, it will eventually turn into
a book of openings that the top players will all have to know forwards
and backwards - taking away so much of their better spent time.
Abstract gaming should not have to use up so much of its effort in the
"memorizing" of specific patterns determined by accidental fixed
geometry  - it should be free at the outset to explore the instinctive
subtle nuances of the combatants. Suffice it to say that I hate the
aspect of becoming proficient in memorizing openings over becoming
proficient in being able to discern the correct move from any given
field position.
