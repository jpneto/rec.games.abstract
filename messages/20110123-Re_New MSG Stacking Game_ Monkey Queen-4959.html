What about the plays that don't topple one way or the other?  Finitude is a
major design imperative for me.  If the players are both defensive or even

Generally speaking I agree: games with 'hard finitude' don't have a
particular problem that for instance taints International Draughts: In
a top level match the player that happens to be in front - in itself
not a frequent occurence in the first place - can 'play for the draw'
very successfully. Even worse: in tournament play 'gentlemanly draws'
are not uncommon.

But it's not all black and white either. I had only one reason to
refrain from saying that Jump Sturdy 'cannot end in a draw', and that
is that predictably some idiot would come and 'prove me wrong'. Yes,
it <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>can<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> end in a draw if only he, the idiot, could find another idiot
to share the thrills of alternately moving sideways with their last
man, ad infinitum.
Of course you don't need a game for that. A table and two coins would
suffice.
So I'll settle for 'soft finitude' if required or inherent.

The race against declining stacks provides balance.  If you're down to your
last seven checkers and your opponent is down to his last three, you can
either go for the jugular or "run the clock".

'Being down to 7 while your opponent is down to 3' doesn't say all
that much. The choice between 'running the clock' and 'going for the
jugular' makes it sound as if material is all that matters. Instead,
you may be in a lost position on the board depite having 7 to 3
reserves.

One could argue that a stackheight of 20 isn't any more arbirtary than
what International Draughts does with the same number of men on the
same board, but Draughts has no 'checkmate' and would not end when the
number of men were limitless. In MQ checkmate is the main objective
and terminates a game regardless of the material reserve of either
player.
The second objective is only aimed at forced finitude in case of
mutual incapability to checkmate. A means to an end, in my opinion.
