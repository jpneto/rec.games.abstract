TIES
If every play of Game X were guaranteed to result in a tie, would you
be satisfied with that game?  Obviously not.

I rest my case. 

It's simply a question of design standards.  If your standard is
"What's a few bad oysters in the pot?" then that's you.   Not me.

I think the world is a better place with Ketchup, an essentially tie
susceptible game.  I think I complimented Ketchup's architecture
initially (after the meatball comment), but if I didn't, I'm doing it
now.  

Do I care if other designers choose to release draw susceptible games?
 No.  That's their prerogative.  I choose not to.  That's my
prerogative. 

CYCLES
Cycles make me feel like I'm dying inside.  The last time I
experienced a cycle in Checkers, I couldn't close the window fast
enough.  I was trembling.  I will never play Checkers again, no matter
what.  

I'm not willing to release a game that could possibly make someone
experience the extreme dread of cycling, however unlikely. 

A tie doesn't make me feel like I'm dying inside.  It just makes me
pissed that I wasted my time.
