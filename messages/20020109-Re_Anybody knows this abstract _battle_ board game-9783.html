ContraPloy

If you're interested in Stratego-style (or L'attaque-style) games, I
strongly recommend ContraPloy.  The twist is that a given piece's
value depends on its location on the board (there is color-coding
involved).  A very strong piece is very weak when off its color. 
Likewise, a slightly strong piece is only slightly weak when off its
color.

"So what," you might say, "I would just keep color to color; how is
that interesting?"  Well, you can't move backwards, so pieces are
forced to contend with unfriendly terrain...
