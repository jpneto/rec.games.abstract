I played the game (11x11) and won it by creating just one diagonal
(weak) connection. The game seems very interesting. It is similar to
Slither in that diagonal connections are prohibited. Similarly as in
Slither it takes a while to get a feel for what is allowed. The X
pattern serves only to avoid races, it has no other practical
application (it may have more meaning in advanced play). Konobi may
turn out to be more interesting connection game than Slither as in
Slither it is very difficult to make predictions and visualize the
effect of moves due to the "moving sands" effect. Congratulations for
another excellent game! Well done.

Thank you, Player. Glad that you like it :)

Here is another sample Konobi game:

Some comments:

After Black 26, White can't stop Black from connecting to the bottom. If White plays 27 at h2, for instance, Black can play either g1 or g2. White can't stop Black from connecting to the top, either.

White 25 was a mistake. Had he played g1 or h1 instead, the game might have continued as follows:

25. White g1
26. Black a1
27. White b1
28. Black a2
29. White b4 (enabling White c2 later)
30. Black a4
31. White b6
32. Black a6 (a6, a4 and a2 are virtually connected)
33. White a8
34. Black a7
35. White b8
36. Black b7
37. White d8 (winning)
