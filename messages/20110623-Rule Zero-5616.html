While here, i would also like to set a precidence for rule 0's, rules
and laws that get used whenever applicable.
Rule 0:
Repetition:  For games where repetition exists, repetition either
forces a draw (3 fold repetition) or repetition loses (by making the
repeated move illegal like with super ko, or making the forcing move
illegal like xiangqi), the default is creator's choice, but this can
be covered in game law (the players could agree to play with a
different choice for repetition and the new game isn't different
enough to even be a variant).  If none is given, and none is agreed
pre match, 3 fold repetiion should be treated as a draw (as the other
starts the arguement between who is at fault for the repetition).  The
player to move is part of a position, and i give no credit to anyone
who declairs a position repeated with the same board but different
player to play.

Stalemate:  Games with stalemate should end in loss for the stalemated
player as rule zero, the other way is the exception (chess with rule
zero has "no moving into check" as a non rule, as it has no effect on
gameplay, chess with stalemate equals draw turns check into a real
rule, thus being the exception)  obviously this has no bearing in
games where you score points.

Balancing rules:  balancing rules that take place outside the realm of
the game (komi, pie rule) are a variation of a game and should always
be considered optional balancing rules, and are covered in laws of the
game, not core rules  (komi exists after the game is over.  pie rule
exists before the game starts.  while the game is ongoing, it has no
effect).

Anyways these are the three proposed rule zeros i can think of, anyone
else got any suggestions?
