What the fuck are you talking about??  The last time I logged on here, there
were four nearly identical posts from you, all uploaded within the space of
an hour.  Why don't you finalize your posts before you upload them, you
idiot??  No wonder Howe was complaining about you.  You're fucking retarded.

So what the fuck have I been doing this whole time removing posts when
I am assured "The message will be removed immediately from this
group's online archive, and it will no longer show up in search
results." and then I don't see the post ever again? I have no idea
what anyone of these pages looks like from your computer and I guess I
don't give a fuck. It looks pristine from my end and that's all that
matters. You're running outta steam buddy boy and all you do is hurl
insults at people on here to supplement the swelling of your ego.
Great Job on Cage by the way, it's only been like what, a year now?
And apparently I'm hanging for dear life on a design I made 4 months
ago which was followed by 2 other very good designs? Mark are you
familiar with the term stfu and gtfo because it applies to this
situation. The only reason you get like 5 posts from me is because I
have a hard time reconciling an interest in maintaining a diplomatic
environment with my strong aversion to bullshit. I'm not worried about
you Steere, that shit about passing on the torch is just friendly
bullshit chit chat, I know you're not one to go down without a fight.
The last thing I'd want to be is you, a man so petty that he has
precariously balanced his dignity upon nights spent in his basement,
holding his dick in one hand and sliding Go stones around with the
other. I'll have no problem on the design front though, you need not
worry about that chief.

P.S. all new posts from me will be final and most decidedly
undiplomatic. I encourage reciprocation.
