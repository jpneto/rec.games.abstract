Christian, I like both Soar and Jump Sturdy.  I am a bigger proponent
than you of Breakthrough-type games; I think they have a lot of
tension and sharp decision making and have used this goal in several
of my own designs, two of which are still unreleased, all of which are
draw-proof.  Of the two I think I will enjoy Jump Sturdy a little more
because I don't have a lot of confidence of my ability to visualize
and plan for the explosions and chain reaction explosions than can
occur in Soar, although it's also not clear to me just how often those
chain reactions will occur and how many events there will be in the
chain, so they might be more manageable than what I imagine.  Not
having a game in the contest, I guess I don't get a vote, but so far I
lean toward Monkey Queen, with Jump Sturdy a close second.  I would
love Stax except for the hidden information problem.
