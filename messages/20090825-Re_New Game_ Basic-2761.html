That was my <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>objective<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>: the largest tree that I could construct, not

Even if we compare the game to others that use just checkers

considerably bigger game tree.  Lines of Action comes to mind,

I don't see right off the bat why Lines of Action would have a larger
game tree.  It has the advantage of using all 64 squares, but there's
no stacking, a major sacrifice of a dimension in a game with stackable
pieces.  I only release naturally finite games.  Lines of action can
get into endless move cycles, creating a giant, fluffy tree.  But in
real terms, like I said, it's going to take some convincing as to why
LOA should be a richer game than Basic.

as checkers variants and stacking games that allow backward movement.

Dipole uses backward movement.  Move forward, attack in every
direction including backward.  But Dipole is a naturally finite game
as well.  When you attack backward, the removal of the enemy stack
advances the game.  There's no possibility of endless move cycles.

I don't know enough about these checkers-based games to say whether
there are others that satisfy your "ergonomic constraint" in addition
to topping your game's tree.  Maybe one of Christian Freeling's
checkers-like games?  The ergonomic constraint definitely makes it
harder.

It isn't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ergonomic constraint.  The game of Basic, using a
Checkers set and nothing more, was obviously designed for use with a
Checkers set.  Why would I make a game for the Checkers set that was
physically impossible to play with a Checkers set?  That's what you'd
have if you added directly forward movement to Basic.  You'd have
tightly surrounded stacks that were physically impossible to pick up
without special tongs or something.  LOA isn't horribly cumbersome,
although it does require a delicate touch, since only singletons are
used.  LOA wouldn't make the cut on ergonomic grounds though, never
mind the draws, here at MSG.

I'm trying to put the best light on Checkers equipment.  To really get
the most out of it, you're going to have to take advantage of
stacking.  There's no way around that as far as I'm concerned.  In the
end, it's hard to generate a good size tree using Checkers equipment.
I know.  I have four Checkers games and four Go games.  The Go games,
if anything, need to be scaled down for beginners.  Checker's
equipment poses the opposite problem.  Checkers games generally need
to be scaled up to 10x10 to create a decent tree.  That's why
Europeans intelligently use a 10x10 board with 40 checkers.
