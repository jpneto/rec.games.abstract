 As for the Let's play a game thread, I must say I feel the entire thread
was decimated when non-color players began making moves before non-color players
were allowed by a present player.  Sort of the feeling you get when you play a
game of Mornington Crescent and the opponent says Mornington Crescent for their
first turn, and does it for several games.

Surely in the absence of an enumerable set of non-player colours there need be
no restriction on the reversibility of the ordering between colour and
non-colour moves.

Perhaps we are confusing statements-about-the-game with statements-in-the-game?

Isn't this related to the distinction between the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus
and that of the Investigations?  Is the game the set of facts about the game,
does the way we speak about game control what is true of the game?

Once we admit of any stylistic ranking of moves then we invent a "parallel
legality" of, presumably, rules that admit of the same fluidity as those that
underlie the meta-rules dictating the elaboration of the game.  Note, the
meta-rules that dictate the elaboration of the game, the rules control the play
- although in some sense the rules constitute the play of the meta-game.  My own
feeling is that this kind of stylistic discourse is pernicious as it reduces the
game to an epiphenomemon of competitive pseudo-intellectual postering.

But I might be wrong. It depends on what you mean by "game" I suppose.
