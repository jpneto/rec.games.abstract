"Life is fundamentally futile and great games are a tribute to
precisely that." - an interesting quote I found on Christian's website
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/">http://mindsports.nl/</a>).  It's funny because in the days before I read
that I had been pondering the importance of abstract games, if any.
The best I could come up with is that it's an art that makes people's
lives a little happier.  But I think Christian's observation is more
to the point.  Games are a tribute to the futile.

Certainly a thought-provoking quote, Mark and Christian.  Abstract
games are futile in the sense that they don't refer to anything
extrinsic and therefore solve no practical problems?  This makes them
no more futile than the art of Jackson Pollock, for example.  Or
perhaps abstract games are futile because they are solved in principle
the moment they are created?  One can even imagine an advanced
civilization with quantum computers that views Go in much the same way
we view Tic-Tac-Toe.  But I try not to take such a grand view, and
therefore I see abstract games as an interesting intellectual
territory where art meets mathematics.  Oh, and I don't necessarily
agree with some of Christian's other quotes, either, such as "Grand
Chess is the natural completion of Chess" or "Dameo is the only way to
rescue 'Draughts' as an international sport."  I guess the key words I
would challenge would be "natural" and "only".  But those are
discussions for another thread.
