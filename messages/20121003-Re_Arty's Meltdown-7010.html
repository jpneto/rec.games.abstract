Apology to Arty.  I don't want to freak out on Arty in public and then apologize in private.  That's weak.  So, here's what I said.

############
You're right.  I do instigate on your site and elsewhere, online and off.  After our tiff this morning, I got into a high speed road rage incident where someone could easily have died, and the police had to intercede.  Luckily my Mercedes CLS63 was more high speed than the Toyota Corolla, preventing the guy from getting ahead of me on the highway.  Talk about "crossing the line".  Don't throw something at my Mercedes window.  That's crossing the line.

Also, I don't remember describing Talpa as "not-too-good" but that was an unjust criticism.  I think of Talpa as not-too-bad, certainly better than 90% of my games - pretty good considering you haven't been designing for 20 years like I have.

I'll stay away from iggc for a while.  Playing games is kind of a waste of time for me anyway at this point in my life.  I should be dividing my time between saxophone practice and physical exercise, not sitting on my butt making moves for hours on end.
