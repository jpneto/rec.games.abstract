Hi.  I have a question probably answerable by a game programmer...

Given a random number generating function which always provides the same
sequence of numbers, is there a mathematical technique to generate truly
random numbers?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

that which seems the most complex or the most random tends to actually be 
comprised of things representable by simple algortithms, although in greatly 
layered and textured interacting ways do they play.  if you consider that what
we consider truly random is not actually random at all, but mind-bogglingly 
simple, then yes.  if you consider what we consider as truly random to 
actually be random, then again, analyze the variables that would inevitably 
definitely in some way affect the result, then try to simulate them.  i don't 
happen to know any certain mathematical technique that "randomizes", but you 
illustrated the paradox in your post very well, by saying, "a random number 
generating function which always provides the same sequence of numbers."  well
said.  that is a good summary of the difficulty.  mail
