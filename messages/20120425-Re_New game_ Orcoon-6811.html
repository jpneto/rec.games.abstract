It's illegal to form this pattern, its rotations or its mirror images on the board:

x . o
o . x

After a placement, any two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones must share at least one orthogonally adjacent, like-colored neighbor.

The above restrictions seem very similar to those of your other game
Konobi.  Could you please explain the difference?

Thanks for asking, Steve. In Konobi, diagonal connections are only allowed on certain conditions, and this pattern is always forbidden:

x o
o x

In Orcoon, diagonal connections are always forbidden, as is the following pattern:

x . o
o . x

In Orcoon, you needn't check anything to find out if a diagonal placement is allowed or not, so this game has greater clarity than Konobi. Also, the occasional race component increases the strategical interest, IMHO. In exchange, Konobi is a pure connection game, and some people may find its trickier tactics more interesting to analyze.

I hope this answers your question. I personally like the more flowing gameplay of Orcoon best, but I guess it's a matter of taste.

Those who don't like to come accross a race every now and then might want to try the variant with the knight's jump connections instead, either with the featured game ending protocol (which I recommend, as I consider it better suited to this particular game) or as a typical connection game. Anyway, you'll notice that the game is fundamentally the same in all cases.
