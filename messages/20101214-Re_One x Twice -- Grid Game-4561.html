I've had a certain problem most of my life,
though it seems to be getting worse lately.

Thank you.

I don't think in words; ignored Leroy's 1/2 distinction as soon as
I realized it was irrelevant; used "Odd" all by myself as an
abbreviation for "Player who seeks Odd total"; forgot to clarify
when I changed my thoughts back into English for posting here.

I don't blame quasi, as I've been having this problem in
almost 99% of the threads where I post lately.   :-(

But just out of curiosity, would you have troubled to take
the time to figure out "what James must have intended" if
you'd known a priori that James is "a very bright guy"?  :-)
