Oh for the good old days, when Martin Gardner wrote the "Mathematical
Games" column in Scientific American and they gave him enough space to
write enough text in his very clear way to give you a real
understanding of what he was talking about.  I don't know if it's
because Ian Stewart is no Martin Gardner or because he only has 3
pages to do it, but I find many of his "Mathematical Recreations"
columns difficult to slog through.

The March 1995 column on the table-shifting problem was the most
frustrating yet.  I'd really like to be able to understand what he's
talking about... and I can't.  I thought I'd look in some of his
references, but whaddaya know... there aren't any.

Can anyone here clarify Stewart's discussion?  Or point me to a
clearer exposition?  Or tell me Stewart's email address so I can whine
to him directly?

Are these the right newsgroups to be asking?
