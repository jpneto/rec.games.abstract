This game is for 2 players.

Start by drawing an n-by-n grid on paper.
(Who would have guessed??)

The players take turns filling in empty squares of the grid, one
square per move. Each player fills in floor(n^2/4) squares, so that
there are a total of 2*floor(n^2/4) squares (about 1/2 of grid) filled
in at game's end.

Player 1 gets as a score the number of grid-squares whose states need
to be changed (from filled to unfilled, or vice versa) in order to
make each ROW a palindrome.

Player 2 gets as a score the number of grid-squares whose states need
to be changed in order to make each COLUMN a palindrome.

The player with the SMALLEST score wins.

{I know that the rules could have had Player 1 score with the number
of squares needed to make the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>columns<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> into palindromes, and Player 2
could have had the rows, then the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>highest<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> score wins; but if each
player attempts to determine their own score, then with my way each
player has an incentive to be as efficient as possible in determining
how many squares need to be changed to achieve the palindromes.}

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
