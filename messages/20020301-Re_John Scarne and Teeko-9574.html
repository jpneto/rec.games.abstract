Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And there's also the fact that he can't even read. After all, if he
could, being so interested in Teeko, he would surely have gone to the
URL I gave in an earlier post
(
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=style/postmagazine&amp;contentId=A43740-2001Jul10">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=style/postmagazine&amp;contentId=A43740-2001Jul10</a>

You know that this is a link to a website which is only for paying
subscribers of the Washington Post. One hint to them would mean
that they will take legal steps against you because posting this link to
a newsgroup is clearly illegal. You should hold your tongue in your own
best interest! Why do you coquet with illegal acts you have committed?


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the tournament was a promotional event; Scarne challenged 10 people --
Braddock; actors Judy Holliday and Walter Slezak; national champions of
chess and bridge -- to play Teeko against him simultaneously. Scarne
offered a $1,000 prize to anyone who could win two out of three games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I.e. nobody had the slightest chance to win money! Scarne won all 30
games.

Every tournament is a promotional event. This is true for every
Go tournament I went to as well as for the recent Neutreeko tournament.
The organizers of tournaments always want to promote their game: they
invite the media, they hope that some newcomers will drop in, etc.
There is nothing wrong with it. It doesn't say anything about the
intentions of the participants. They may participate to win money, to have
fun, to prove that they are the better players, etc.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Not to mention
&lt;&lt;It's unclear whether Scarne actually sold the hundred thousand or half
million Teeko sets he claimed.&gt;&gt;
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can doubt everything! You could also doubt the claims of
Parker Brothers or Gigamic. Perhaps the World Trade Center was
destroyed by the CIA... What do you think? Are all Americans liars?

I think there is overwhelming evidence that Teeko was widely played,
not only in the USA, but also in South Africa. The weak aspect of the
Washington Post article is that the journalist drew the conclusion that
Teeko existed mostly in the mind of John Scarne, BEFORE he started his
field "research". The whole article is overshadowed by this prejudice,
while at the same time he reluctantly admits again and again that the game
was perhaps known to more people than just Scarne.

BTW Scarne says in his book that Teeko was played in Frankfurt, Germany.
Frankfurt. Frankfurt has one of the largest US military bases in
Germany. Although nobody knows for sure, the game was presumably played by
American soldiers (and the "club" probably closed down when they moved
back to the States).
