I should explain to the readership that my "hunter" style of design was so
named by Christian.  From the perspective of designing games with popular
gameplay, the hunter description would be pretty accurate, given that a
small percentage of my games end up being popular (though some very
popular).

But I'm not hunting for popular designs.  I'm glad when my games do turn out
to be popular of course, but my goal is striking architecture.  Looking back
of course, some of my games' architectures are more striking than others. 
Monkey Queen's is among my finest.

I found the most (and perhaps only) relevant item in the comparison of
Cyclix and its predecessor Monkey Queen to be Michael's mention of
Renaissance.  Monkey Queen is not the first game to employ the
birthing/cycling mechanism.

By the way, the difference between birthing and cycling is purely semantic.
The pieces are in play and out of play.  It doesn't matter what the pieces
are doing while they're off the board - whether they're feeding from a pile
to be used once and discarded or whatever.  As I already explained in the
Monkey Queen rule sheet, if you only have 12 checkers of each color, you can
still simulate stacks of 20 with cycling.

The issue of an infinite supply vs finite supply vs recycled supply is
cosmetic.  I could say, "Oh great, let's give the monkey queen an infinitely
recycled checker supply."  That would have made the rule sheet much simpler.
 Can you say superko?  No thanks.

The cool thing about Monkey Queen is not just the birthing mechanism but how
that mechanism works in combination with the merging mechanism to produce a
compelling, finite architecture.

1. A queen either kills or gives birth, but
   not both at once.
2. A baby kills an enemy piece and/or moves
   toward the enemy queen, which is a moving
   target.

All of this conspires to create a game seemingly infinite in its fluidness,
but which gently marches the play toward a conclusion, every time, reliably,
no matter what.  That's what I strive for in my designs.

The shift to queen-like monkey babies from king-like monkey babies was not
quite the struggling salvage operation Christian might have you believe.  It
was a major structural change, but it was a very simple change and it was
the only major change.  Other than that, I only modified the board size and
stack size, once pre-baby queen and twice post-baby queen.  Cosmetic.
