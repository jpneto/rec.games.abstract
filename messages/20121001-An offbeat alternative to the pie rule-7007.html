I've come up with an offbeat generalization of the Symple balancing mechanism which can be used in most stone placement games and maybe even other kinds of games as well. It is as follows:

Instead of making a regular move, a player may choose to make a certain special move. Once a player makes the special move, neither him nor his opponent can make it for the rest of the game. If the special move is made by the second player, he still has the right to make a regular move on the same turn.

Here are two simple examples of special moves which can be used under this protocol in most stone placement games:

a) Moving any or all your pieces to adjacent empty points.

b) Taking as many steps as stones you have on the board. A step consists of moving one of your stones to an adjacent empty point. Each step can be made with any of your stones.

Other kinds of special moves must be possible as well. The only requirement for them to work as balancing tools is that their value keeps increasing at a constant pace for a long part of the game, starting from less than half the value of the best move in the first turn of the game.

As in Symple, the idea is that players will only want to make the special move when its value is as close as possible to half the value of the best regular move, as simple maths prove that:

a) making it before that point costs the player more than letting his opponent make it himself, and

b) letting the opponent make it after that point costs the player more than making it himself.

Symple has the great advantage that special and regular moves are the same, which makes this balancing mechanism fit the game like a glove. My generalization retains the advantage over the pie rule of not requiring players to make intentionally mediocre first moves, but it also dramatically changes the opening phase of almost any game it's applied to.

Of course, I'm not suggesting it as a replacement for komi or the pie rule. I just think it's an interesting curiosity, and I'm wondering if it's possible to invent other games whose movement or placement rules fulfil the aforementioned requeriment to be also used as special moves for balancing purposes, as Christian did with Symple.
