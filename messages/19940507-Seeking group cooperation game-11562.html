A friend of mine who does management training seminars asked me
if I could devise for him a game that would illustrate the synergy
of group cooperation.  The Prisoners' Dilemma does this to some
extent but he would like a game which also has an individual
component so that the participants can see some kind of score improve
from their participation as an individual to their participation as a group.

Here's his description of what he would like: a game with rules such
that as each person solves it individually through some sort of "Aha!"
process of discovering the (or an) answer, they get a score commensurate
with their answer.  The group is then tasked to solve the same problem
but as a group.  There must be a reasonably easy to get answer whose
score is greater than the number of people in the group times the highest
score that an individual could get, illustrating the synergy.

The only constraints on the type of game are that it be suitable for
play in a management seminar (i.e., we are not talking rocket scientists).

The only idea I've had has been to give participants a number of wooden
sticks and those little balls with the holes in that join the sticks to
make molecule models, plus some saran wrap and a number of ping-pong balls.
They each have to make a shape that will hold as many ping-pong balls as
possible when the saran wrap is used to enclose the shape (making a
convex solid).  Then they get to pool all their sticks and balls; they
should easily be able to make a shape that contains more ping-pong balls
than the number of participants times the largest score that any individual
came up with.  Any other ideas?
