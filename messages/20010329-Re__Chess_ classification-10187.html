I am speaking of the final goal too, not of casual captures.
I mean we can rewrite the rules without changing the game
and explicitly state that the goal is to have captured the
most in the end. Territory shall then turn out to be only
a derived concept describing means to achieve the goal, if
you ever want to speak of territories.

I admit if we start to rewrite rules then we may put forward
anything we want and cypher anything else - with enough
devious wit. That's not what I advocate for. I claim however
that there is hardly one single natural formulation of a rule.

If I wanted to distinguish between a sheer goal and mere means
in the name of reason, I would not be satisfied with obvious
facts and I would take some distance with my own subjectivity.

Again, the final goal of Phutball is to move a piece somewhere.

The rule is often expressed in this way. I suggested one other
way. In the final goal, again - and not a better way, only an
alternative. You are able to see Trax's goal as a connection,
why not Phutball?

Ok, maybe we need to wait until our culture encompasses thousand
games to see arbitrary better where it was lying in disguise.

I consider Trax a connection game. The argument would be that you either
connect a "path" to itself, or you identify the upper and lower, resp. the
left and right to see if they are connected.
