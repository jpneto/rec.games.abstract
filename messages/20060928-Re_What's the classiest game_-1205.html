It's not just you, Patrick.  Abstracts are royalty among games.
Checkers, Chess, and Go are all magnificent achievements for their
simplicity and fundamental uniqueness.  Checkers especially has
probably been more imitated than any other game.  How many games
include the Checkers jump?  The jump is a wonderful mechanism.  It's
simple, unique, and easy to perform. But every time I see the jump
appear in a new game I want to barf.  Designers: Just leave the jump in
Checkers and come up with your own mechanisms.  It's challenging but
not impossible.

Backgammon is a great game, but I guess I have to go along with the
pack that its randomness does make it a lesser game.

To me the Gipf series are nothing special.  Yinsh for example, as I
critiqued in another forum: "I don't understand all the excitement over
Yinsh. You've got the Chess slide, the Checkers jump, the Reversi
flipping disks, and the Tic-Tac-Toe n-in-a-row. WAY too many mechanisms
for one game. The jump and especially the n-in-a-row feature are beyond
cliche. And this is all tied together with a score - three max - which
can very easily result in a 0-0, 1-1, or 2-2 tie. Yinsh has all the
architectural splendor of a trailer home."

My beef is not with the inventor of Yinsh; it's with the gaming
community.  They get giddy with excitement over all of last week's
leftovers dumped into a cauldron, boiled to gray mush, and served
lukewarm with a plastic teaspoon.  Get some standards.

Modern games that have awed me can be counted on one hand: Reversi,
Hex, Y, Fire and Ice, Dots and Boxes, and Sprouts.  (Ok, two hands.)
Abstract games are like diamonds.  The exquisite ones are exceedingly
rare, and the lackluster ones are innumerable.

It's not for me to judge which, if any, of my own games (Quadrature,
Tanbo, Impasse, Byte, Diffusion, Cephalopod, and Copolymer) can be
considered "classy."  I can only say that the design I'm most satisfied
with is Copolymer.  Ultra simple, fundamentally unique games like
Copolymer don't come along every day.

Is it just me, or does it seem that abstract, perfect-information,
deterministic (no randomity) strategy games are generally considered
the classiest of all games?

Chess and go, for example, are world renowned.  Royalty has been known
to willingly be associated with these games, and many people regard
them as more than just games.  They've generated a wealth of
respectable literature.

Contrast that with backgammon, another age-old classic.  Popular
opinion seems to hold that it's a lesser game--probably because of the
dice.  Even bridge, though highly regarded, somehow lacks the class
that chess and go enjoy.

There may be exceptions, though.  Checkers (draughts) has long been
disparaged as an inferior version of chess--something for children or
old folks to kill time with.  Yet those who know the truth about
checkers rightfully hold it in high regard.

Some abstract games have faded into obscurity.  But whenever someone
reaches into the shadows and drags out hnefatafl or seega or nine men's
morris, the awe and respect is still there.  They're not just
historical artifacts; there's an enduring mystery and challenge to
these games.

Even abstract games of more modern invention--Gipf, for instance--seem
to be regarded as superior to the vast majority of games that are
available.

Or are they?  Maybe I'm the only one who sees this phenomenon.  Am I
just imagining things, or do some kinds of games have a classier
reputation than others?

And while we're at it, which game do you think is the classiest--and
why?
