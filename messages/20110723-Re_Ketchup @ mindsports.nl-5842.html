OBJECT OF THE GAME

To win you must either:
1. Kill the enemy queen or
2. Deprive your opponent of legal moves by leaving him with a queen of
height two, no babies, and nothing within line of sight for said queen
to kill.

Yes, you're a genius, what was the object again? Shouldn't it be "for
a sad queen to kill"? And why "height two"? It's not a stacking game,
but even if it were, why?

Ever seen a position where a baby could have checkmated if it hadn't
been obliged to crawl towards the target to satisfy the inventor's
cyclophobia? The rule hampering the game? How much of a problem would
cycles be? You're killing a mouse with a bazooka. And you're marring
games because you're not listening to them but instead force them into
your dogmatic framework.

Out of fear of course, because you'd be lost without a guarantee that
a design will 'work'. It's the only way for you because you lack
intuition. Cage resembles a large sandtimer filled with black and
white marbles. It's all going down the drain and someone will come out
last: that's the winner. Of course it works, and that the only
criterion for you to declare "superior architecture". Rive has this
superior architecture, but it's boring as hell. Bashni has a very
questionable architecture (I think we might even agree here), but it
is great drama and great fun. Havannah <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>can<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> end in a draw. Players
would welcome one as a remarkable event, but you can see no value in a
draw, whether the margin be large or small. It down't fit your black
and white world. You can't handle the "undecided", hence your
inability to communicate.

And Monkey Queen is still hailed as "new" on your page, because you
can't come up with something new. The "millions of ideas awaiting
implementation" are rather evasive at the moment, aren't they. Fora
can be so distracting.
