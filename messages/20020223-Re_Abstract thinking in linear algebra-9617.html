And keeping a child who can learn more in a dumbed-down

Those who can think abstractly, and I believe that this
is most, are born that way.  It can be knocked out.

You really want to know what I thought when they forced me
out of 1st grade into 2nd grade in mid-year.  I made it
perfectly loud and clear at the time that I thought it was
a REALLY stupid idea.  Especially doing it during Easter
break AFTER the 2nd grade class had already gone through
their Phonics.

As a kid, I never spoke up or acted out or anything.  But if I
had, and if I had been fully versed in adult language, this is
how the sentiment translates and is precisely what was on my
mind at the time:

"Nice going, morons!  That was a really brilliant move there,
damned Liberal social engineers.  How do you think those kids
in the 2nd grade class are going to respond to having someone
a whole year younger dumped in their midsts, while they're trying
to put in an honest day's work?!  Did it ever dawn on you that
at that age, a whole year's difference is a HUGE difference?!
HELLO?!"

"I had a good thing going in 1st grade.  Friends the same age,
girlfriend.  How am I supposed to get it on with the babes in
2nd grade, when they're a whole year older.  You don't think
we 5-10 year olds think about things like that.  Well, I have
news for you.  We sure as hell do.  Hell, I even walked my very
first day to school to kindergarten hand in hand with my girlfriend."

"Just give me my morning cup of coffee, stay the HELL out of my
business, give me my alone time at home so I can do my REAL studying,
learning and research, and you won't even know I'm there."

"Don't try to pull this social engineering crap, because frankly,
if you knew where I REALLY was at, you couldn't handle it and you
wouldn't even know what to do with it.  Why do you think I've been
going out of my way all these 6-7 years of my life to keep it
discreet, in the first place?  Studying late at night when everyone
else is asleep; faking my test scores downward so that they only seem
slightly above normal; keeping vigilant secrecy during my alone time
so that nobody would ever find out exactly what I was studing, etc.
Becuase I knew you'd trying pulling off that 'we know what's best
for you' nonsense, when in fact, you don't even have a frickin'
clue!  Thank God you never found out where I was actually at."

The teacher notes on the report that "he seems to be having
difficulty [sic] getting along with kids [sic] his own age".

Basically the one and only bad mark ever.

"There were no children MY age!  I was just forced up a damn grade,
DUH!!  Or did we conveniently forget that fact?!  I told you people
not to skip me!  It was going to take me away from my friends (i.e.,
disrupt my social network), place me in with kids 1 year older --
which at our age is VERY conspicuous -- and breed extreme resentment
amongst the older kids.  Frankly, I don't blame them for reacting
as they did.  I'd have done the same thing.  Maybe next time you'll
listen, when I say I don't want to go."

In fact, had I not put my foot down on a later occasion they would
have forced me off to a Montessori school.  But I wasn't having any
of that.
