Hex isn't just a game in which one player attempts to form some J-
random pattern like a happy face, and the other player tries to
prevent that pattern from forming.  Hex is a game in which a randomly
filled board produces exactly one of: a connection of black stones
between the two black sides, or a connection of white stones between
the two white sides.

Yes, by thwarting your opponent you simultaneously achieve your own
objective.  But that little coincidence does not make Mind Ninja a
generalization of Hex.

Currently it's the only generalization of Hex.  Is it the only
possible generalization? I suspect that to be true but I wouldn't know
where to begin in a proof of that.

When you generalise something, you choose which properties you want to
retain and which you want to relax.  There are no a priori right or
wrong choices for this, so you can't claim that a game that has Hex as
a special case isn't a generalisation of Hex, just because you don't
like the type of generalisations that are made.

At most you can say that Atoll is the only generalisation of Hex that
preserves (list of properties).  But that is a vacuous statement if
the list of properties exactly define Atoll.

Depending on what aspects of Hex one sees as crucial, there are surely
many other ways of generalizing it.

Indeed.

I think it's fair to say that by far the most crucial aspects of Hex
are that it's a connection game and that in a randomly filled board
exactly one player forms a stated connection goal.  Not to mention
that it's a game of equal goals.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

These are indeed notable properties, but breaking some of them just
generalises the game even more.

And, BTW, Y fulfills the above properties but is not an instance of
Atoll.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Now you're going to tell me that this totally unequal goals game in
which you barter to decide what type of shape one player is going to
form, among happy faces, yin yangs, and what not, and which the other
player is going to try to prevent from forming is a generalization of
Hex?  All because it shares this one little property of Hex that
achieving your objective is equivalent to preventing your opponent
from achieving his?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You clearly haven't understood the concept of generalisation.  You
might say that you think it is an overgeneralisation, because you lose
properties that you want to retain, but that doesn't make it any less
of a generalisation.

Do you understand what a generalization is?  I think some of us here
missed out on high school geometry.

Heh.
