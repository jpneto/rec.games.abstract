Oh, yeah? Very interesting. Back in the late sixties Parker Brothers came out
with "Universe," a pentomino game for 2-4 players. The rules were similar. For
2 players, the board is 10x10. In addition, there are four regions of
25 cells each appended to the 4 sides of the main square. The entire
board has 4-way rotational symmetry. For 3 players, use any two extra regions
in addition to the 10x10 grid. 4 players use the whole board. On your move,you
may not place a pentomino so as to "fence off" a region of &lt; 5 cells connected
horizontally and/or vertically. (Ofcourse only the active portion of the board

is considered.) If you have no move, you're out of the game.
The last player to move wins.

Trivia: the game box contained publicity stills from "2001:A Space Odyssey."
One shot shows an astronaut playing Hal a game of something that looks like
Universe. Apparently that scene never made it to the movie. :)

yes - i remember seeing that come out.  it was an upgrade to Pan-Kai, which
was also Parker Bros., but earlier.  there was a screen image of pentominoes
in "2001", but it wasnt being played by anyone, just in the background along
with other flashing lights &amp; panels...hard to pick up, cawz its panned past
rather quickly....
