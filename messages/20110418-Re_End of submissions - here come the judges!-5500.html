Sorry.  I have an update that I haven't gotten around to writing.
But actually I'm glad to see some interest as I wasn't really sure if
anyone was in anticipation.  Last time I asked Mark assured a snooze
fest and nobody really came forward to say that they were
interested. :P

Basically there are/were 6 judges.  I'll just name them to make this
simpler.
Jan - Has played every game and is awaiting the voting process.
Yay!!!  He put a lot of thought into each game and came to every
scheduling. five stars.
Doreen - needs to play 1 more game.  Left the country to perform twice
during the process.  Just returned, finally finished her studies in
University this week so was mainly busy studying.  I should be able
get her sometime this week, now that all that's settled, for a game
session to finish up.
Dave - needs to play 1 more game.  Can endure 1, 2, maybe 3 games in
one setting.  Might be able to get him in this week.
Luke - 1 more game! We hit all the games but one in two 2 hour
sessions.  He was out of the country for about a month performing.
Might be able to get him in this week.
Declan - Despite being flatmates is rather hard to corner into playing
a game. Constantly teaching, partying or training.  I need to corner
him to play 2 of the longer games... I'll probably hit him last.
Namer - Played 5 of the games and then flew back to Israel... If he
doesn't play the game at home then I'll count the votes without him.
He's quite reliable so I might be able to get him to play with his
flatmate in Israel.

Me - not a judge, have played each game at least 3 times, 4 of them
lots of times and 2 in particular with many different people.
I'm pushing people schedule-wise as much as I can.  Unfortunately 4 of
the judges are working performers. Meaning training and traveling time
restraints.

Game updates:
Stax is no longer in because of the many makeovers it's had since the
deadline and I don't want to organize that everybody play it again
with the new ruleset.

3 games especially can be quite long and have bottlenecked the
finishing.
Kasanari Shogi - setup and planning out moves.  This game overall has
seen the longest play times;
Twisties - can go on for quite a while with no imminent end;
Mixtour - we solved this by only playing to 3 points, so I guess I
don't really have to mention it, but it's there anyway.

Nothing to do with the games so much as the time it takes to play
them.  "should we play these 2 or three games? ...or do you have time
to play one of the longer ones?"

I'm really curious how the judges vote as it's not really clear which
one will win at this point.  I'm not sure if any 2 judges have the
same favorite game, but there is a trend in the top half of the games.

There's your update!  Hopefully it makes the volcano happy and the
village won't be destroyed =)

- Daniel

....oh yes the deadline.  At this point I'll announce the winners when
the judges are finished playing the games and the votes are in.  May
1st? I hope so :D
