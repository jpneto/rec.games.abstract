Has anyone tried "double-move" Hex where the two stones placed cannot
be adjacent?  (A player may choose to forego the second stone because
of this constraint.)  Of course, the goal of such a variant would be
to neutralize the first mover advantage.  Any comments appreciated,

Yes, "double-move" seems to be a good way to neutralize the first
player advantage. But what is the reason for your rule against placing
two adjacent stones?

I played some games from micro to larger boards, and here are two reasons:

(1) The "doublet" move, if not disallowed, breaks the basic "bridge"
structure of Hex
(which I call the "stride" in my games) while I was trying to preserve the
flavor of
Hex.  Interestingly, mobility/extension becomes greater (the "jump" is
connected) and
simple extension by doublets is too hard to stop -- leading to a futile
doublet-ridden
defense of doublet attack.

     x   The stride        . .   But the
    . .  is not a         x . x  jump is a        IF DOUBLET IS NOT
DISALLOWED
     x   connection.       . .   connection!

(2) Disallowing the doublet introduces ko (or enhances? I have always
thought Hex ko-ish
but can't explain it).  The game is still Hex but "more so".

   o a . .   White (o) to defend but    . x o     White (o) to attack and
    x b a    cannot play doublet so      a b o    plays a; black defends
DOUBLET
     x o .   plays a; black plays b       x . o   with b and tries to
DISALLOWED
             and somewhere else.           a x .  attack somewhere else.

I considered disallowing even the bridge (stride) in a double-move but tight
positions
became nearly unplayable, and defense suffered.  Possibly, one might
disallow an open
bridge ("2-connected") while allowing a (partially) blocked one.

Hex is a paradoxical game -- offense being too strong leads to defensive
strategies...

Aside: double-move variants typically are slugfests; witness Abalone which
is a stalemate
under standard rules but FUN under double-move.

I recommend playing doublet-free, double-move Hex on a larger board than
usual.
