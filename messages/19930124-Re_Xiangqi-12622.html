In a previous article, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:engp2063@nusunix1.nus.sg">engp2063@nusunix1.nus.sg</a> (NG CHEE MUN SIDNEY) says:

It would be interesting if those from European / American  Xiangqi
clubs could post some xiangqi games to this group for our analysis and
discussion.

I am curious to know the level of Xiangqi at any of these clubs.

I think as long as xiangqi enthusiasts divide their posts between
rec.games.chess and rec.games.abstract, the interest in this game
amongst Europeans and Americans will remain at a minimal level.
I for one don't usually read this newsgroup and I'm sure other chess
players who might be interested in xiangqi don't either. Posting
to rec.games.chess doesn't exactly solve the problem either.

If the idea is to increase interest in this game amongst
westerners, or to find out "the level" of xiangqi at clubs or
amongst individuals in countries throughout the world, the
solutions are obvious:

1. Creation of rec.games.xiangqi

2. Creation of the International Xiangqi Server (just like
   chess and go have)

If there can be a newsgroup on tiddlywinks, that proves there is
enough interest for a group on xiangqi. As long as info is posted
to other newsgroups, no one is going to care much, and you're
likely to lose a lot of people in the process.

I don't claim to speak for a club. Just one xiangqi enthusiast's
opinion. Dissenting views welcome.
