Mark,

I know your fondness of extreme, say, purity in abstract games, so I
fully understand that you do not like arimaa. Maybe you will be a
little more interested in a naturally finite arimaa variant which was
devised some years ago by Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent. It's
very simple to play, and the mechanics it uses to keep the game going
without rushing it into an early end are quite clever. In fact, a
simple calculation tells us that the average game will last about 70
moves... in a 5x5 board! You should really take a look at it; it is
called Pushee:

I haven't seen this game being talked about a lot, so I thought that
you (and everyone else here) may not know it yet. I think it is also
more scalable than arimaa, but IMHO arimaa (as well as chess) is more
or less scalable too...
