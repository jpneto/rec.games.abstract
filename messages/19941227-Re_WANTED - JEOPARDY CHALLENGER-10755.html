My last post resulted in uncovering the name of the hand held Jeopardy
Challenger that I was seeking.  No one in my area seems to carry this
item any longer.  If anyone sees this in stores or has a unit that they

I don't believe that the Jeopardy! Challenger, which was made
by a company called Interactive Television, is being made any more.
You may be able to find some copies in older toy stores that don't
turn over their inventory as fast as your basic Toys R Us.

In addition to the newsgroups already posted to, this reply
is being posted to the alt.tv.game-shows newsgroup. There are
quite a number of Jeopardy! fans and former contestants out there.
Someone in the group is bound to have one. Whether they'd want to
part with it is another story. But you never know.
