Rules and Conditions

Game Restrictions:
1.  Stacking as part of the mechanism.

No sand timers.  No donkey tails.

Hmmm.  Sometimes you go to invent one game and you end up inventing two.  If
they aren't minor variants of each other, and the inventor can't objectively
decide which is "better", I don't see the harm in entering them both.

Allowances:
1.  Concerning topology.  Since we're not worried about an
implementation prize I say we crack this wide open.  If it can't be
played in the iggc sandbox we can play it  in google docs (or
somewhere else if someone has any suggestions) during the playing and
deciding phase.

Yes, if you can set up a generic stacking game.  This might be a tough phase
if it's either hard to create the document or manipulate it.  I'm thinking
of possibly using a hex board.  The only limit on how wide to crack it open
is that it should be playable in real life.

Deadline:
Because of the holidays and because one is a date of significance to
me I'd like to make the deadline for the entry Feb 9th and the
deadline for the decision Feb 23rd.  3pm Berlin time for both dates.

Everything in abstract games happens on a geological time scale so I don't
see any point in rushing the contest.  For a me a month of design effort can
easily slip by with nothing to show for it.  I think we'll have more games
and better games if we make it three months.  Winter just started, so we
could make it first day of Spring.  Plus I haven't even really started yet.
I have to reach over and replace my Hexboard Havannah board with a Toys R Us
checkerboard, and I'm not quite ready to do that yet.  By the way,
Christian, you have some nice boards on your website.  I think I'll order
some at some point.

Prize:
Honest BGG full review of the winning game from each of the
participants.

Well, I never go on bgg, but the contest seems like an interesting diversion
since I'm developing a renewed interest in stacking games anyway.  They're
hard to represent on a computer screen though, unfortunately.
