Mark, would you be so kind as to give me a direct quote from
this thread stating that the contest would be judged purely on
quality of play, and not at all on relevance.

I never said it was in this thread.  I said it was in "the discussion".

 From the "Stacking Games Contest Judges" thread, Feb 21, 2011:

disqualifying Monkey Queen by saddling it with deductions
for 'not really a stacking game'"

Daniel: "I understand this and assure you that games will be
judged on which game the judges like best."

Oh shut the fuck up already.  I'm really getting tired of you.  I invited
you here in the hopes of bringing our private discussion about Monkey Queen
into a public format, but that didn't happen.  The only mention you ever
made of Monkey Queen here is about how it doesn't qualify for a contest
which you have no knowledge of.  Fuck off.
