Here is a game for 2 players.

Needed: An n-by-n grid drawn on paper (with an n of at least 8, I
suggest).
Two markers (such as coins), one for each player. The markers should
be small enough to both fit in one square of the grid (possibly by
stacking them).
Two pencils/pens of different colors.

The players start the game by each placing their marker in any square
of the grid different from where their opponent placed her/his marker.
The players then mark the squares they start in with an X (or with
different symbols, especially if the colors of their pens/pencils are
similar).

A "move" consists of both players moving one square each.
Players alternate, taking turns who is the "directioner" and who is
the "decider".

On a move, first the decider decides if the players will move in
opposition or in synch, and announces this decision. Then the
directioner decides which of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right,
or diagonally) the directioner will then move, then he/she moves his/
her marker.

If the decider decided that the players move in synch, then the
decider must move his/her marker one square in the same direction
(from his/her current position) that the directioner moved her/his
piece (from the directioner's previous position).

If the decider decided that the players move in opposition, then the
decider must move his/her marker one square in the exact opposite
direction (from his/her current position) that the directioner moved
her/his piece (from the directioner's previous position).

Based on where the players are at the beginning of a move, the
directioner must pick a direction where both players stay on the
board.

If any player moves his/her marker onto an empty square, then that
player draws his/her symbol in the empty square. But if both players
move onto the same empty square, or a player moves onto a square with
a symbol already in it, then no symbol is drawn by that player on that
move.

When all squares are filled up with symbols, or when one player has
more symbols than the number of symbols his/her opponent has + the
number of empty squares, then the game ends. The player with the most
squares with his/her symbol is the winner.

A variation: (Is this more or less fun than the first version?)
The directioner picks the direction first, then the decider decides if
she/he will move his/her piece in synch or in opposition. (The
directioner, in this version, only moves based on whether he/she can
stay on the board, then the decider must move to stay on the board.)

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
