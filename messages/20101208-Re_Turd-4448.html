I am. I'm concentrating on a game on your site where the design
process is described as an act of revenge against me for all the wrong
I've done against you. Now this is an outright lie, I pretty much
stayed out of the dispute you were having with Bill Taylor. At least
be honest about the design process. I figured you just needed an
opponent for Bill Taylor. Great, say that. Don't say I'm one of two
posters who doesn't like you very much. And don't use my damn name!
You might as well write Corey Clark, there is no other "Corey" in the
abstract games community that I'm aware of.
