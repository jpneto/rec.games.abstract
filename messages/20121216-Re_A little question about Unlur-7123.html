Hi Luis,

In response to your original question:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I wondered why the rules doesn't avoid this by simply stating: 
"Black wins if he makes a Y which touches three non-adjacent 
sides of the board and loses if he can't possibly do it". 
Wouldn't it be more elegant, and thus preferable? 
Is there any obvious fault with this that I can't see?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

An argument against this might be that the rules as stated are more direct. The result is the same in each case, but this may not be immediately obvious to new players. The additional level of indirection caused by implying a win for White as a non-win for Black seems just that little bit less clear, and connection games are generally typified by their clarity. 

Also, condensing the two opposed winning conditions into one might be more compact, but could be seen to obfuscate things a tiny bit.

Though these are minor points. Nice suggestion!

Regards,
Cameron
