The game obviously can't proceed forever using only addition steps, since the
list of numbers keeps getting shorter, and when it's down to a single number
you have to factor it (or it's prime and the game is over).

In a factorization step, the game replaces a number with a list of at
least 2 factors greater than 1 whose product is the original number.
When you have a list of at least 2 integers, all of which are greater
than 1, their sum is always less than their product except for the
special case 2*2 = 2+2.

So look at the game as a series of factorization steps, which reduce the
sum of the whole list, and addition steps, which preserve the sum of the
whole list but are limited to a finite sequence after each factorization
step. The sum of the whole list proceeds steadily downward, and can't do
so forever since it's always an integer and can't become negative.

That damn 4=2*2 is the only thing getting in the way of a clean no-draw
game. No fixed length needs to be imposed, just a draw by repetition.
And even that seems to be rare. After studying a few positions I haven't
found one yet where the best move leads to a draw.
