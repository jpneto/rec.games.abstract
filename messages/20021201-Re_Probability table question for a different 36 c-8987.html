I recall discussion of Settlers, where, instead of dice, it was
suggested that there be a deck of 36 cards representing every
permutation of dice rolls to come up.  This approach is to insure an
even distribution of dice rolll results to balance things out.

Ok, my question is this:  Let's say, we have a deck of 36 cards.  The
deck consists of 6 cards of each possible die roll on a 6 sided die
(1-6), for 36 cards (6 1's, 6 2's, etc...).  The cards are shuffled
and TWO cards are flipped over and a die roll result is generated.
What would the odds distribution be for doing this?  Would it be the
same as standard dice rolls or different?  I am curious, because I was
interested in kicking this around as a new way to generate two six
sided dice rolls.

No. As I'm guessing you know, if each of the 36 cards has a different
permutation of 2 dice (i.e. 2-1 and 1-2 are not the same) then the
distribution for the first draw would be the same as if dice were rolled.

However your method reduces the chance of doubles from 1/6 to 1/7. So each
possible doubles is reduced from 1/36 to 1/42 while each other combination
(now counting 1-2 and 2-1 as the same) is increased from 1/18 to 2/35.

Given that you have 36 cards anyway, to ensure identical probability
to 2d6 why not have each card showing both dice - 11, 12,
13...64,65,66 ? Of course unless the pack were shuffled before each
draw a good memory would be at least as important as in the original
idea, but the initial purpose would be served.
