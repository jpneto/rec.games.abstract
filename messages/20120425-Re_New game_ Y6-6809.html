Not to be a downer (well, ok, to be a downer) but this game does exist, and in fact has been invented by several different people. I don't have time to collect the references now, but they're out there. I don't know if Bill Taylor still reads this but I know that he could provide references as well.

I've also spent some time trying to remedy a problem associated with this game:

However, I would like to know more about problems associated with this game. Whether the game has existed before does not matter much. I still would like to play it. Obviously with the pie rule in place there should be some opening moves where the result is not clear. So what is the problem? It seems obvious to me that playing on the edge is a poor opening move and playing in the center a very strong move. It follows that somewhere in between there should be a move / moves which allow an interesting play. I also cannot believe that on a hexhex board with side 10 there is a trivial winning strategy. In fact after playing for a while on a board with side 6 and side 8 I came to believe that side 7 would be enough for a quick but interesting play. That is why I posted such a board. I look forward to hearing more about this game.

Certainly the center in Y6 is important,  but that is also true of
Hex, and even more so in regular Y.  I don't see a center-oriented
game as problematic in itself.  Most checkmate games, most connection
games and most elimination games are center-oriented, and there are
many in these classes which I enjoy.  However enjoyment is tied to
personal taste, and for some people a center-oriented game may well be
distasteful.  But to me it is only a problem if the gap in importance
between the center and edge is "excessive," there being no exact
definition for that.

Most territorial games, however, are more edge-and-corner oriented,
e.g. Go, Amazons (I think anyway, but I'd have to ask an expert player
to be sure of that), and my own game Anchor.  (This is not to say that
the center in these games are unimportant, only that they are less
important than the edges and especially the corners.)
