|&gt; I was thinking about card games and realized, that all (at least the ones I
|&gt; know) card decks are two dimensional (value x suit or colour).
|&gt; Has anyone ever thought of a three (or even four, five - well, I could go
|&gt; on like this for quite a while...) dimensional card deck? The obvious (?)
|&gt; design I came up with was: 
|&gt; 	VALUE x COLOUR x SIZE
|&gt; If you give each dimension four possible values, you get 64 different cards, 
|&gt; which looks like a nice deck-size to me.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Now, that we have the design - or at least a first attempt - we have to
|&gt; find an application for it. Everything I could come up with up to now, is
|&gt; very mechanical (i.e. boring :( ) so all comments on this thought would be
|&gt; greatly appreciated.

  An interesting thing would be to play around with trump games (Skat,
Bridge, Doppelkopf).  You can describe the way these games work by an
ordering, which determines who makes a trick. Normally, you designate
one color as trump, other colors are lower and incomparable and within
each color you have a linear ordering depending on rank.  The first
maximal card wins. Of course there are complications like that you
must follow suit, etc.
  Now with more dimensions, you could announce all cards which have
a certain value in a certain dimension as trump. This dimension takes
the role of suit as in usual games.  Rank is a combination of the other
dimensions, where a card is higher if it is higher in one of these
dimensions and higher or equal in the rest (this is the usual product
of orderings).  You could also use a lexicographic combination of the
other dimensions to determine rank, but this would make the game very
similar to usual card games.
  Of course, some kind of auction is needed to determine what becomes
trump.

Please excuse my clumsy english gaming terminology.
