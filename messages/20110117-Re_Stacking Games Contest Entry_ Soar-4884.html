I played Soar for the first time today with my flatmate... and since
'Pommel' got some flack for sounding strange in Dutch.  I'll just say
that after mentioning the name Soar in conversation a bit it starts to
sound a bit Herpes-ish :D

You're right, Soar sucks, I already wondered why nobody has come up
with "Sore" lol. I'll change it (exploding towers ... 9/11? ... no,
better not :)

The explosions are very entertaining.  I've never seen this before.
I liked this game more than the new racing game.

It originates in a game published in Games&amp;Puzzles Magazine in the mid-
seventies.
Martin Medema used it in Explocus:

I use it in the race game Breakthrough and the monumental Mu:

You're right that Soar (or whatever) is better. It has a "nothingness-
to-fulness-to-near-nothingnes" cycle and elimination is a nobler theme
than race.
Yet Jump Sturdy is simple, streamlined, and has an unusual twist in
that a single attacking a double cannot be captured by that double's
top man. But when the top man moves, it exposes the bottom man. That's
a source of nice and novel tactics.

And anyway, I'll post a third 'provisional entry' shortly :)

about the applet... I hope you don't mind the feedback, but it's hard
to tell who is what color unless you look at the chat below... er...
it's not obvious anyway.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Mindsports uses a switch of color for a swap, so when you're white,
you're white, but black may begin depending on whether or not he
accepts the swap.

Also I wasn't able to send a message without making a move.

The names above the applet are "mailto's".
Our "userfriendlyness" fully deserves the quotes I put around them, I
agree. It's an old structure and it will be replaced in due time, but
Ed has a regular job and mindsports is a hobby. It should be fun and
not a burden, so we're guarding for that :)
