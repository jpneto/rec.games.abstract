This game appears to have a pretty easy first player win. You just keep
attacking the other player's piece. If the other player stops defending
to attack you you will surround his piece first. If he keeps trying to defend,
his piece can be trapped along an edge in short order.

No: the board's periodic: there is no edge.  This strategy actually
loses: you build two walls, the opponent builds one then moves.  If
the first player then stands still, they're dead: they're now a wall
behind.

have an advantage, however.

    The game still looks to have a first player win if the right
strategy is used.  In your example, the first player need only change
the strategy slightly.  If the second player moves, build one wall above
him, and if he builds a second wall, move yourself.  The second player
can then also move, but eventually will run into a previously built
wall.  As an example, assume the first two turns are as depicted above.
Then have both players build a wall, and then the first player moves.
The situation then looks like this:

. . . . .
     O  |
. . . ._.

. . . . .

._. . ._.
  |    X
. . . . .

    The first player is again in the advantageous position, with one
fewer walls and one more free space in the horizontal direction.  If the
second player also moves, build another wall above him (or her), if the
second player doesn't move build another wall to one side (preferably
the left this time, restricts movement more).  Have fun!
