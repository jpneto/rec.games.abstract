<br>can't and the move that you make might as well be random.

<br>Isn't this statement true of all abstract games, not just sprouts?

<br></blockquote>
<br>It is true of all those CGT (Combinatorial Game Theory) games, such as 
sprouts and nim, in which the values of all positions are stars.&nbsp; In 
these games, the position is neutral between the players - all that 
matters is which player's turn it is, and whether an odd or an even 
number of moves will be made.&nbsp; The players, of course, can influence the 
latter.
<br>
<br>It is not true of chess, go, and most of the games discussed here (I see 
Zhadu, Octo, Arimaa, and Dvonn at present).&nbsp; In these games, it is 
possible to make what appears to be a gain, without achieving a position 
that you can prove is a win.
