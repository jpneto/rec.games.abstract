That's the exact issue.   You hardly ever hear, "I'm just too stupid
for game x," but that's exactly what the problem is in a game that
"lacks clarity".  In my case, I freely admit that I'm not a player.  I
"lack clarity" in Dots and Boxes and many of my own games, such as
Crossway.

In addition, the
best games seem to reveal themselves only very slowly, and you
repeatedly discover that you're playing poorly in various ways.  In
this view, great games are kind of opaque to begin with.

Another good point.  You buy a shoe two sizes too big so you have room
to grow into it.  You certainly don't want a shoe you'll grow out of
in a month.  Scalability in games such as Go is very helpful in this
regard.

Yep, I believe that too.  You have a sense of "all I have to do is..."
and then 12 moves into it your crystal ball has misled you.

I think this might be conflating clarity with depth.  I think clarity
refers to the ease with which a player can determine which moves are
legal now and for several plies forward.  Depth is the degree to which
different levels of skill determine the winner.  If the moves are easy
to see for 12 plies, but the position takes great experience or skill
to evaluate, then the game has great clarity and depth.  I think
clarity is always desirable and that opacity is often used to create
the illusion of depth.  T-T-T has clarity but no depth.  Tai Shogi has
depth but terrible clarity.  Those would be at or near the extremes.
Games with excellent clarity and depth include Hex, Go, Breakthrough,
Epaminondas, Amazons, Oust, and doubtless others.
