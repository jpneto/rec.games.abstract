more notes:


*This game can be easily converted into a multi-player game
environment. I made it a point to have the breeders in the core game
design passive, and made it a point to have all characters sexless,
i.e., there are no males or females, only the player's characters and
the breeders, instruments of modifications, which both can be given
names like bOnK and HoNk. Now if this was to be made into a
multi-player game, which it can be easily done, than the issue of sex
is going to matter. Are there going to be male and female game
characters? What becomes of the passive breeders? Can the game
characters mate with each other, command going to the player with the
most "teach points," or maybe both players of the new character will
team up and control the new character in the higher levels. There are
many questions; I not going to profit from this idea of mind so I'm
not going to spend the rest of the day trying to answer them : )

*The binary code, which can also be used to randomly design the
breeders (How? Flip pennies, dummy,) used to manifest the biological
system (attack, life, speed, teach)of the game characters to the gamer
can be expanded to hold so much more than the four elements; it can
hold other elements like magic powers and other cool stuff like that;
just, remember, keep on multiplying by 2,or until your head or the
fucking machine breaks : )

Fuck Windows and those fucking judges, you hear about the ruling,
"control the langauge control the mind." Java might not be much but
hell its something.
