(Not sure if this isn't too trivial for your forum...)

I was thinking about modifications of the simple `Five-in-a-row' game
(two players on a go board, winner is who first makes a contiguous line
of five stones of his colour). (It is called `gobang' sometimes.)

Generalize this to (m,n)-gobang: m players, aiming at n stones in a row.
So (2,5) is standard, (2,4) is trivial (first player always wins).
You might enjoy (3,4) which is not at all trivial. Funny situations
arise where you're forced to cooperate against your will or where
you let the third player respond to a threat against both him and yourself.

My wild guess is that on an infinite board, for m&gt;1, there's an n
such that a strategy exists (for one player) which guarantees that none
of the m players ever can make a n-row. Is this true for m=2 at least?

Yes, there is such a strategy for n=7. (two players) It involves tiling
the board with a pattern (with a size near 7x7) that tells you where to go
if your opponent makes any move inside that particular pattern.
Something like that. I think the reference is Winning Ways Vol. 2 by
Berlecamp Canway and Guy.
