After the publication of InSight I got some commentary, most of it
favorable. The same happened after Monkey Trap. But Soar was mostly
met by silence, as was a really great game like Sygo. A game may be
good, even excellent, but if the mechanics and their implications are
not immediately accessible or somewhat difficult to visualize, the
game may go unnoticed despite its quality.

I considered that an indication that a game like Soar will not win a
contest because the time to test the game is limited and the game is
not immediately accessible. For one, the object is to eliminate men
that aren't even on the board yet, at the start of the game. Go
visualize that.

So I needed another game, original, yet traditional, with an easy
recognizable object and a familiar setting. And stacks of course.

I started out with something Halma-like with discs in two sizes,
whereby smaller discs could land on bigger ones, but not vice versa,
and discs of like size could capture one another.

It turned out the Halma theme was boring, something of a bygone age
where time proceeded at a slower pace. So I turned to a breakthrough
and race theme, the object being to be the first to get a man across
the board to the opponent's back row. The general signpost was Dan
Troyka's minimalistic yet ever so deep game Breakthrough, but of
course the contest required stacking mechanics, so I had to find a
simple and effective way to implement that. Fortunately I stumbled on
a rather novel of employing stacks, and only stacks of two men at
that, by not merging a stack to one piece but leaving any double as
two seperate pieces at all times. A novel way of progress with its own
logic and its own implications, but still in a very traditional
setting: anyone with a chessboard and a checkers set can play.

The 'why' is obvious, here's the 'how':

For the moment I'll leave them both as possible entries, to see
whatever comments may be valuable for the final choice.
