A problem faced
here is that the world doesn't really care that Mark has good
designs.  That is a problem.  People who do designs like Mark aren't
able to make a living doing them.  The games are given away for free.
Even if Mark was much more of an agreeable personality, he still
couldn't make a living doing it.

Is anyone able to make a living from game design, apart from just
a small handful of lucky ones.

What I wrote what I wrote on Boardgame Geek relates to this (let's
grow the pie, rather than fight over marketshare of a fixed pie).  The
problem abstract (strategy) games face also impact other genres.
People think abstracts suffer in comparison to the likes of Euros, but
here is the reality: In other places of entertainment, top artists/
authors/etc... get rich.  With boardgames (and yes, count abstracts
among them) top designers MAYBE make a living.  And then take players
of these games.  Due to the lack of resources, there isn't a
professional class of players for boardgames.  Even in chess, you have
some that do it, but professionals usually have left chess to play
poker, due to the money angle.  There is a ton of hurt here, and
itsn't as viable.

And this is all the stuff I have been working on, and the organization
that I am not allowed to name on here, is supposed to be about,
addressing these issues.  YES, there is a desire to have abstract
strategy gamers get a larger piece of the pie, but the focus is on
growth, not fighting over turf.
