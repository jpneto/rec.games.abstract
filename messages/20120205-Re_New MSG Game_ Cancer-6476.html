Played Cancer twice on  a base 5 hex hex. Interesting tactics but I
think that size was too small and maybe a square topology would be
preferable and prevent groups from growing out of control. It
definitely seems more balanced than Go upon first inspection but I
don't have much experience with either game. But if you're planning to
release it I implore you to change the name. I get bad vibes from
playing a game called Cancer.
