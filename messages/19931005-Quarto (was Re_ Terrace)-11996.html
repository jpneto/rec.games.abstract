Is this the game with the round and square pieces with varying colors and
heights that you and an opponent take turns placing on a board until
one person lines up four pieces with a similar attribute?  If it is, I
played it once at a convention and was not too impressed.  The basic idea
is neat, but in the game I played against a distributor, we played nearly
to a draw but with three pieces left I got careless and put the wrong piece
down.  Looks to me like this game could always be played to a draw.

I was also not to impressed with the price. $30 for a few simple to make
wooden pieces and a plastic game board?  Give me a break.
