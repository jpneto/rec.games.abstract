Here's in interesting piece of Abalone trivia: even without the
no-repeats rule, there are reachable Abalone positions in which there
are no legal moves.  The orignal Abalone rules do not define what
happens in such a situation.  I will leave it as a puzzle for readers
to find examples of such positions.  I know of several.
(Rotations/reflections obviously not included.)

This is incorrect.  Because the rules do not prohibit pushing your own
marbles off the board, there is no position from which a player can be
made unable to move.

Actually, you can not move or push your own marbles off the board. At
least, that is what the American Federation of Abalone said when I
called them and asked.  However, that was over a year ago, and they
may have changed the rules since then, for all I know.  But at the
time, they said no, and they had no answer for what to do in the
no-legal-moves situation I presented them with.

We should find out whether moving/pushing your own marbles off the
board will be legal in the tournament.

In any case, assume you can't for the purposes of the puzzle.  It's
still an interesting puzzle.
