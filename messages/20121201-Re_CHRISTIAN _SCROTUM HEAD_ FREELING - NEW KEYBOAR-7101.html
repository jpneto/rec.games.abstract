Well, I said that you should try and understand my point, so this doesn't really count. I thought you might, y'know quote me and explain what you thought I was saying. 

I said that there had been 250,000 games of Arimaa. Since that is true, you must have thought that I was implying something false. Perhaps you can explain what you thought I was implying, and we can see whether I did imply it.
