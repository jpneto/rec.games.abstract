I was also in Russia (for a few weeks back in 1989), where I learned the
card game durak (pronounced doo-rock').  Durak is the Russian word for
fool.   The game is played as follows:
The dealer deals six cards to each player (three or four players is optimal).
The dealer then takes one card off the top and turns it over to name the
trump suit.  This card is placed at the bottom of the deck face up and
sticking out.  The person to the left of the dealer begins.
This player attacks the person to her left by laying down any one of her
six cards.  She may lay down more than one card if they are all of the
same value.  At this point, the other player(s) (but not the player being
attacked) may also lay down cards that count in the attack, if the cards
are of the same value.
The attacked person must either meet the attack or add all the cards to
her hand.  To meet the attack, she must beat each one of the cards laid
down.  She can beat a card by laying on top of it a higher-value card of
the same suit or a card of the trump suit.  A trump card beats any card
in a non-trump suit, but it can only beat a lower-value card in the trump
suit.  Once she has beaten all of the cards laid down, her opponents can
lay down new attack cards if they match the value of the cards she laid
down to meet the initial attack.  The attack contintues until either she
can no longer beat a card, in which case she is forced to pick up all the
cards laid down and add them to her hand, or until her opponents choose not
to continue the attack.
If she successfully meets the attack, she then has the right to attack the
person to her left.  If she fails to meet the attack and has to pick up the
cards, she forfeits her turn to attack.  In this case, the person to her left
attacks the person to her left.
When the attack is successfully met, all the cards laid down are placed in
the discard pile (called the "bita" pile in Russian).  These cards are
permanently removed from play.
After each round, every person with less than six cards left in her hand
must draw the difference from the deck (until the deck runs out).  The game
continues until there are no cards left in the deck and only one player has
card(s) left.  This person is the durak (the loser) and must deal the next
game (in which she is the first attacked, if it is a three-player game).
It's a wonderful game.  Hope you enjoy it!
