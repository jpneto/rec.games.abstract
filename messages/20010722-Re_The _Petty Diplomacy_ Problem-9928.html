I looked at the two pages cited for rules for Faustus and Cerberus.
The rules for Faustus were fairly complete, though I didn't quite
follow how the Archpieces capture.  Do they move an arbitrary
distance in a straight line and then jump one piece and land on
the immediately following space?  Do they move an arbitrary distance
in a straight line but jumping at most one enemy piece (with any
amount of empty spaces before and after it)?  Or what?  The thing
that particularly confused me was the bit about how they can capture
only one piece at a time, but most still capture as many pieces as
possible.  Is that saying that they can do a series of capturing
moves, but each part of the move captures only one piece?  Anyway,
it was unclear.

The "rules" for Cerberus were no more than a brief top-level
description.  No mention of how the pieces move.  (Not even a
link to another game that might've mentioned how they move.)

But at the more abstract level, I don't see how making the goal of
a game be "to lose" really helps solve either of the cited problems.
There will still be cases where one player is threatening victory
unless the other two work together to stop him.  And there will
still be cases where two players are threatening victory, and the
third cannot achieve victory himself but can stop either -- but not
both -- of the other two.

The only way I've ever seen to deal with the kingmaker problem is
to have the game itself provide some incentive for choosing which
king to make, as it were.  E.g., the third-place player could be
given an incentive to play so as to "maximise his own position",
whatever that means in the particular game.  In a game where each
player has a score of some sort, the player might be trying to
maximise his score.  In some settings this can be done by having
a monetary payout/penalty related to the size of each player's
score.  Or the players might be playing a series of games, with
their scores being accumulated across several games (perhaps with
a bonus for winning each game).  Even so, kingmaking is hard to
eliminate completely.
