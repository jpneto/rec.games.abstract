Well, I suppose that in a way I am "cheating", because I am able to take
back moves, but since you can see all of the cards, this is equivalent
to just planning everything out on paper first...

I can win about 9/10 of the time. Some of the games take me quite a
while to do, but I can usually get 10 or so in a row before I come to
one that I just CANNOT do. 

I kinda wish that my version was like the X-windows version. I think I'm
going to give up on trying to 50 in a row.
