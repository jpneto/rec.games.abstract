Howdy,

[[ crossposted to rec.puzzles since a few of the people that haunt ]]
[[ that newsgroup have enjoyed my puzzle applets and might be      ]]
[[ interested in this game applet.                                 ]]

I've added a new abstract game to my web site, at
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nitlion.home.mindspring.com/paddachee/index.html">http://nitlion.home.mindspring.com/paddachee/index.html</a>

The game is "paddachee", a pattern achievement game.  Players alternate
marking cells with their color.  If you complete a scoring pattern (for
example, a 2x2 square) you get some points.  Most points wins.

The applet allows interactive play human-vs-human or human-vs-computer.
Computer player's ability can be adjusted.  Note that the computer player is
fairly simple, has no lookahead, but plays a strong game none-the-less.  I
will probably tweak some settings in the computer player to make it
stronger.

This is a game I invented back in the mid 1980's.  At the time I called it
'diz' but the name paddachee sounds better and says something about the game
phonetically.

Please let me know what you think of it.  I need to expand a little on the
play example, with some strategy hints.  If you find any errors (especially
in the rules and examples), by all means let me know.

Merry Christmas,
Bob H

P.S.  The site is not commercial.
