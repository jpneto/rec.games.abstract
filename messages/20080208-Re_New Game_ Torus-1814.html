Alas, the same can be said about your "Torus".

It is a game I considered some while ago, but discarded
on the ground that the two players had noticeably different
goals, of unequal difficulty.

You're wrong.  The two goals are exactly equivalent.  When viewed in
3D form, they "appear" to be different.  One player is surrounding a
circular axis and the other a linear axis, but in the 2D form the game
clearly has equal goals.  The 2D form is isomorphic to the 3D form.
The 2D form can be morphed into a rhombus with the left side matched
to the right side and likewise for the top and bottom, if that makes
you feel any better about it.

The E/W direction paths
have a different (global &amp; local) topology from the N/S paths.
If one wants a game that's as symmetric as possible
between the two players, this isn't it.

In your game, as in mine, one player has a possible goal of forming an
N-S loop and the other player a W-E loop.  So it's way beyond me how
you arrived at the conclusion that your game has equal goals and mine
doesn't.

The NZ game remains the best attempt at full
player equivalence, though.   IMHO.

NZ has full player equivalence and so does Torus.  I wouldn't release
an unequal goals game.
