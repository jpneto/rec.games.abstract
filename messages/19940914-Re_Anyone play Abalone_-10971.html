:-)  isn't that the case with any game? Take chess: if I don't do anything

	I don't believe that intelligent play is necessarily identical to per-

can play it perfectly?

But in a way I share your opinion. Only I think that it is ignorance.
Abalone (again like chess) does have a workable strategies to play for a
win. It is only that I haven't found them yet.

	The trouble with Abalone is that defense is too strong, and this fact
is enough to "throw a spanner in the works" for some of us. In a well-de-
signed game, offense should be stronger than defense.

Obvious strategies:
keep you marbles together; try to occupy the center; prevent that your
adversary does the same. Anything else?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	Try an experiment: deliberately keep your pieces in a huge lump, and
see if your opponent can break apart the lump. Chances are your opponent will
have to seriously weaken his position in order to have a hope of making any
kind of a dent.

	Perhaps some minor modifications to the rules would tip the balance
in favor of offense. For those of you who also see the current rules as being
badly balanced, let the rest of us know how you've improved them!
