Product Hex:

Joao Pedro Neto and myself have been playing this game by email
for some time now.  The recent spate of similar games inspires
me to mention it here.

On a hex-hex board, players play alternately, two stones at a time,
OF EITHER COLOUR(!), until the board is full. There are no
restrictions and no capturing.  The first player plays only
one stone on his first turn; this 1-2-2-2-... move sequence,
(12* in regular language form), acts as both a 1st-move equalizer
and a spicy variant to increase skill.

The idea is to make two separated groups of stones where
both are as large as possible - the winner is whoever
makes the largest PRODUCT of the two group sizes.
Any smaller groups beyond the largest two are ignored.

If the game is played on too large a board, it is too easy to make
several groups, and becomes a mere race.  If on too small a board,
there will be only one group each, and a scoreless draw -
beloved of no-one except die-hard soccer fans.

We have found by trial and error that the ideal board size seems
to be a 5-cell-per-side board, 61 cells in total.

PRODUCT HEX
===========
Played on a 61-cell hex-hex board.  12* Hex play, but the players
may play either or both stone colours.  The winner is whoever has
the higher product of sizes of his two largest groups,
counted when the board is full.

If there is no second group, its size counts as zero.
