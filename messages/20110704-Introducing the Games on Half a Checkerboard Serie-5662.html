This post is to do a brief get the word out about the Games on Half a
Checkerboard Series.  Over 20 of the 26 games in it are pure abstract
strategy games.  It ended up being more of a proof in concept of how
may games could be created for, and adopted to, half a
checkerboard.

If anyone is interested, you can check this list out on Boardgame
Geek.  Here is a short URL to the list of the games, with the rules
downloadable also:

I am taking a break from the Series.  I am looking to eventually get
the Series up to 32 games for it, one for each space on the board,
which will likely grow increasingly different, and likely not be
abstract strategy games.  I will let you decide if the games are all
bullocks, boring, or uninspired derivative shlock, or whatever.  There
is a mix of old and new in there, for a number of reasons.

Anyhow, thank you for your time...
