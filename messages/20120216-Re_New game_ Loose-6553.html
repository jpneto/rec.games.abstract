I've just discovered a great, non-obvious feature of Loose: assuming
that players will only pass their turn when there are no more useful
moves available, the game will <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> end in a tie.

In Go, ties can occur if there is an odd number of empty points in
seki, but seki patterns in Loose always involve an even number of
them. So the only purpose of the tie-break rule that I included is
turning a game which is already drawless in practice (or "soft-
decisive") into one which is also theoretically drawless.

I've posted a comment in the Life In 19x19 Loose thread asking for
help to either prove or disprove this claim, but now I'm fairly sure
that it's true. Since single vacancies surrounded by both players are
false liberties, for all practical purposes it doesn't matter if
they're filled or not. Therefore, if there were an odd number of empty
points in seki, there would have to be at least three adjacent empty
points shared by both players. But in this case one of these points
can always be filled without danger, so in the end there will always
be an even number of points in seki.

It's nice to have a Go variant which is not only hard-finite but also
soft-decisive, tie-break rule aside, don't you think so?
