Zzzzzzzz   :)    Not exactly breathless anticipation for me.  I practically
forgot about the contest.  But yes, when the results become available, I
will be interested.

Today I managed to organize 4 different people to play the
games. Tomorrow I have a game session appointment and
Saturday a friend is going to step in at my work so that I can
meet with her friend while she takes over my shift for the
duration of the games. I have a house guest who just recently
got the abstract itch so I hope to sway him into joining the
jury.

In all sincerity, and on behalf of all of the contestants, I thank you for
the effort you're putting into this contest, Daniel.  Initially, I had
notions of playing all of the games myself, several times.  Now...  [shaking
head]  I couldn't possibly play them.  Not because I think they're bad games
but because my lethargic self has now fully reasserted itself, laughing at
the silly notion of me playing all the games.

I've mostly been the person who plays the games with people
since getting people in a group to play abstracts is like telling
people that we should all hang out in the cold together.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yep, I hear that.  Abstracts are cold.  You have to shore up your warm and
fuzzies before you sit down to play an abstract.

This has seemed to spur a bit of interest in abstracts at the
Spielwiese, which is great. Maybe more people will come to
the Monday night abstracts workshop.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Excellent.  Maybe set up a video camera just to observe the event as a whole
if you don't have time to walk around videoing everything.  Or recruit a
volunteer to do the videoing.  Again, I'm confident I speak for all when I
say... We wanna see this.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A proper analysis of these games of course takes time.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly.  And, I might add, what I've been saying all along....

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I said that I'd finish off with a video,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, you did, so at least turn on the camera and set it on a shelf.  At

On another note...  What's with all these copycat games from Nestor lately??
 One more copycat game from Nestor and I'm firing up the Tidbits press.
