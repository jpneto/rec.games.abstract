Full Release dot com is full of shit. Cannot download after payment.
Refused to reply when asked due to inability to download any file.
Only reply to you before you make any payment.

So steer clear of them. They promise lifetime membership but only able
to login to view a long lists of game files, program file and others
but cannot download any file. Try as you may, your credit limit is
always being reached.

To download unlimited, may pay more to upgrade. What happen after you
upgrade? Need to upgrade further, probably.

Bottom line, full of shit. Don't get cheated.
