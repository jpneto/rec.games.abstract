Personally I like to learn about games by playing them, but I do realise
there's plenty of folk like to read up on how to do better so fair comment..

One of the most appealing things about checkers is that it is a game
with a community, and a history. Regular international tournaments,
official titles, newspaper columns, etc. Because of this, I think it
may be possible to convince people that it's a "real" and "serious"
game. Most people aren't willing to take a game to any non-superficial
level unless they know such a community exists.

Sure, I like games where no one really knows what expert play looks
like, and you've got to figure out everything on your own. But most
people aren't like that. Since I'm not afraid of a little book
learning, I  play these games so as to not be so lonely :-)

This suggests to me that in this day and age anyone close to a large town in a developed country should be able to do something similar if they really want to.

Don't get me wrong. I don't know much about International Draughts
yet, but if I really want to, I'm sure I can contact the Dutch
embassy, the Norwegian-Singalese friendship committe, the Senegalese
boys I met at a summer camp 8 years ago, all the local boardgaming
clubs, the newspapers, the "strange people around the country" TV show
(with myself as the exhibit), get two dozen 10x10 boards made, order
clocks, translate introductory materials, and get Oslo's first
International Draughts club rolling. That is if I <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> want to.
It's still not rocket science.

But I think I really just want to get a board and some pieces, play
some games with my friends, and see if this is something worth going
further with first.
