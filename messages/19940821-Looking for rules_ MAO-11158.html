-&gt; I'm looking for the rules to a card game I played at a convention
-&gt; once, called Mao. It's an interesting game mostly because the only
-&gt; person that really knows the rules is the dealer.
Interesting that I'm someone else has heard of it!  I know well the
rules of Mao, having played many games with various math-oriented
high-school students.  It seems to be popular mostly with mathy-people.
Unfortunately, I can't tell you the rules, since learning them is the
point of the game.  I will tell you though, that it is not necessarily
the dealer who knows the rules.  Anybody can play, and each player may
or may not know the rules.  It seems that the dealer was the only person
who knew the rules in your case and was teaching you the game.
Obviouslyy, though, there needs to be at least one person who knows the
rules for a game to be played.
Well I'm done.  Mao.Mao.
