A funny thing happened on the way to wanting to promote Seirawan
Chess.  IAGO World Tour, in response to the question, was told by one
of the designers to "buzz off", and that he didn't like Chess
Variants, didn't care what the chess variant community named them, and
didn't want to have anything to do with chess variants.

Since IAGO chess was developed only <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> this happened, then, I
presume his complaint wasn't that IAGO was trying to claim ownership
of Seirawan Chess - as it is doing, understandably enough, with its
own invention, IAGO Chess.

The complaints were, by one of the designers, that they didn't like
the chess variant community, and didn't want their game changed in any
way (aka variants as I understand it, which means their pieces would
only be usable for their own game).    They also didn't want Seirawan
Chess on the IAGO World Tour either.  End result was a need for
something else to be done, that was sufficiently different enough, and
also cleaned up a few other issues in Chess (like the case of needing
to flip a rook in order to have a queen).  Anyhow, what IAGO Chess now
isn't just some variant, but a framework to evolve chess.  The
standard rules to Seirawan Chess can be plugged in and IAGO Chess is
still IAGO Chess.  Seirawan, etc... would be credited for it.

However, the names you are using, taken from Capablanca Chess, for
those two combined pieces, aren't really the most common names used
for them <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, although Capablanca did use the name for the
Chancellor previously established with Chancellor Chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Capablanca is like the center point in this.  IAGO goes with the
names, as a tribute to the Capablanca center point now.  It is also
done, in order for familiarity.  A secondary objective is to have some
more generic pieces be introduced so Grand Chess,

Instead, the combined piece Rook + Knight is usually known as an
Empress, and the combined piece Bishop + Knight is usually known as a
Princess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

And wheat do you then call the Queen+Knight piece if you do that, and
Amazon?  As for Princess, the P is used for pawn.  The Rook+Knight has
had several names.  One of them is Empress.  Another one is Marshall,
and another is Chancellor.  According to the chessvariant site, there
are multiple names for the pieces.  Seirawan uses none of them, by the
way.
