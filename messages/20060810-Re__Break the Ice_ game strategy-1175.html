   One thing we humans can handle that the program can't, also, is
seeing when there's only one "major" arch left, and counting the number
of things that branch off of it. For example,

     OO.......
     OO.......
     OO.......
     OO.......
     .O.......
     .OOOOOOOO
     .OOOOOOOO
     OO.......
     .OOOOOOOO

That game board has one arch in the second column, and then eight 
independent "branches" coming off of it. We immediately determine that
the game will last exactly nine more moves (since each move knocks out
exactly one branch), and so we know who will win. But the computer
would have to examine (on the order of) 9-factorial game trees to
come to the same conclusion via alpha-beta!

There are a few steps involved in a human analysis of that position,
and I think you should be able to mimic most of the steps in a program.
Indeed, you seem to have implicitly assumed the program was doing the
first step, which is to recognise various classes of equivalent single
moves.  E.g., c1, d1, e1, etc., all lead to the same position, so it
doesn't matter which of them is chosen.

The next step would seem to be to recognise independent classes of moves.
That is, if one of the moves c1...i1 is chosen, and the move a6 is also
chosen, the resulting position is the same regardless of what order they
are chosen in.  As someone else has pointed out in this thread, that's
why this position really leads to only 2^8 or so positions, reflecting
which of the 8 independent classes of moves have been taken so far.

The final step would be to recognise that the classes themselves are
interchangeable and thus all that really matters is how many of the
moves have been made, not which ones.  That's probably harder to write
define in a way that's easy to analyse in general, but you might not
need that level of analysis to get acceptable performance.

On the other hand, even for very small boards, a human can have very little chance of determining the winner or optimal 
move. For example, what is the best move for the first player on a 5x5 board - and how much will they lose by with 
optimal play. Or, in the position:

xxxxx
xxxxx
xxxxx
xxxxx
xx.xx

what move (with optimal play afterwards) leads to a win in 14 moves, and what move leads to a loss in 15?

A possible way to seek a suitable scoreing heuristic for an alpha-beta search might be to solve the game for smaller 
boards (up to 6x6 appears practical) and search for patterns in the winning/losing moves that may, or may not, be 
applied to larger boards. If this approach works then you could tune the scoring parameters for larger boards by 
playing different versions of the program against itself. On the other hand, combinatorial games theory has shown some 
games that show no discernable pattern in optimal play. In these games, there is no short-cut to knowing the complete 
game tree.
