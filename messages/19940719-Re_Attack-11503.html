: somewhere else? Perhaps someone can tell me the rules.
As far as I remember, the game was one of a series published by Gibson - 
one game on land warfare, another on naval, another on air while 
Tri-Tactices being a combined-ops game. Attack was the land one. It is 
basically Stratego - each piece has a certain rank. You have no idea what 
each piece of your opponent's is since each piece is on a stand and the 
back of the piece faces you. 

When you move back to back to an opponent's piece, there is an attack and 
both sides reveal their pieces with the higher rank winning and 
destroying the other.

Hope this helps.
