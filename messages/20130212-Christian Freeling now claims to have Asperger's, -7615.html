The only people I've encountered with genuine psychiatric disorders are Evan Koch (Zurround) and Hazen (Monieur Buffoon).  Evan seems to have verifiable Asperger's and Monsieur Buffoon is a pathological liar who's changed his identity so many times he no longer remembers his real name.  He really believes he's an expert in everything, including math, poetry, gambling, and game design (rofl).  Putin syndrome.  Except Putin is certainly highly intelligent while Monsieur Buffoon is a simpleton. 

I thought Ralf Gering was psychiatrically impaired with the extreme megalomania, narcissism, and frothing temper tantrums, but it turns out he's just acutely German.  

Then there's me, raging against the mediocre machine.  Is there anything more futile?
