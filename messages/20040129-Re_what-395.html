Abstract games are in a sense games without a strong theme or
setting.  Examples of abstract games are Chess and Go.  Games
such as Monopoly, Settlers of Catan and Squad Leader are not.

Am I mistaken in thinking that a game whose mechanics could be as easily
explained without the theme is a suitable topic for this group, even if the
game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> presented with that theme? But that if the mechanics are
complicated enough so that they are too hard to learn except as a model of
some aspect of the real world, then the game is not a suitable topic?

"Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a
species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of
reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and
makes a crime out of things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a
blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded."
 - Abraham Lincoln, speech, 18 Dec 1840
