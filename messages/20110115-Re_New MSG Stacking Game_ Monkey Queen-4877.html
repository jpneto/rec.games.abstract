Make that four.  Either MQ is a really great game, inspiring all manner of
variants, or it's a terrible game that nobody can resist suggesting
improvements for.

We've seen "offspring" games before, but not (to my knowledge) "live
offspring", nor a limited amount of them.

Consider Amazons: presumably the babies all male and hence thrown
away, never surviving the impact. Or indeed Monkey Trap, where the
coconuts aren't very dangerous either, not even when they come down.
And in both games they keep coming till you're smothered by your own
offspring.

So this concept is quite new and has an understandable logic: your
offspring is on your side, and giving birth wears you out. One of
those ideas that seems so simple in retrospect that you tend to think
"why didn't I think of it?".

I'm always a bit wary about leaving an idea where you found it. Now
that it's in the open, I think we can expect others to consider it,
and who knows what happens. The idea might find lucky mergers with
different concepts or turn up in different forms.

So I think it's a great find and MQ is not in need of improvements,
but the principle involved  begs playing around with it and in any
case having it in one's toolbox.
