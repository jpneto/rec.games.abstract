|&gt;   There are 2 players, each player has 3 pieces on the board. The pieces
|&gt;   inhabit one of the "0"s above; the lines between the "0"s indicate
|&gt;   valid moves from that location. The goal of the game is to leave your
|&gt;   opponant without a move. The pieces are initially placed around the 
|&gt;   perimeter of the board, alternating. i.e. the center is vacant, and
|&gt;   the order of the pieces is (white,black,white,black,white,black) around
|&gt;   the edge.

|&gt;   I haven't analyzed the game, but it ought to be a piece of cake. 

Should be!  There're only 30 essentialy different positions!  60 counting
player-to-move.  So it ought to be a lot simpler than e.g. tic-tac-toe.

Yes, it is easy, though I believe you mean 35 essentially different
positions, or 70 counting player to move. It is a draw; a drawing strategy
from the initial position given is to avoid making any of the following four
moves or their mirror images:

   . X         X X
  X O O  --&gt;  . O O
   O X         O X

   . X         X X
  X O X  --&gt;  . O X
   O O         O O

   X O         . O
  . O O  --&gt;  X O O
   X X         X X

   X O         . O
  . O X  --&gt;  X O X
   X O         X O

On the first 3, the opponent has a one move win; on the last, it is a two
move win.

To be able to draw from any drawn position, there are another five moves to
avoid; three of them give your opponent a one move win and two give a two
move win.

The maximum depth of any winning or losing position is 5 plies in the
following two positions - i.e. a 3 move win for the player (X) to move:

   X X
  X O O
   . O

   . X
  X O O
   X O

In the first of these, the winning move is forced; in the second, the only
alternative leads to an immediate loss.

Overall, this means that it is possible to play this game perfectly from any
starting position with 4 ply lookahead. Given the limited branching factor,
this is perfectly feasible for a human player. I'd guess this is probably
the easiest way for a human to remember the perfect strategy, though a
computer program would probably just be table-driven!
