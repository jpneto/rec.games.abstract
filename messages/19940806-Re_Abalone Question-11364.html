The first player to push a total of 5 marbles off the board wins.
There is no second place.

If a player has had 5 of his marbles pushed off the board, then someone
else has won.

Your logic is flawed.  In a 6 player game, player 1 could have had
a marble pushed off by each of players 2 through 6.  No one has yet
won, but player 1 still has marbles, and thus continues to play. A
player that has had a lot of marbles pushed off the board should
continue to play since the remaining marbles are of strategic importance
to the other players.

Even in a 3 player game, player 1 could have had 2 marbles pushed of
by player 3 and 3 by player 2.  All players should continue until there
is a winner (someone has pushed 5 marbles off the board).

I have not had the chance to play multiplayer abolone (I'm looking
forward to playing abalone on rrognlie's server this fall), but I
would like to play test several variations of the rules.  (Could you
support multiple rule sets Richard?)
