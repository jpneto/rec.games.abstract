As everybody knows who has read my previous message completely, I
constructed these comparisons to illustrate my argument against comparing
humans with machines, implying that these comparisons are unbefitting as
well, and that I for that reason "do not care what computer programs can do
(!)". The sophisms used by desJardines (twisting words by putting them out
of context) are not worth more than one sentence (if anything at all):  It
is clear from his behavior that he isn't interested in serious discussion,
but wants to ridicule other people, so that he doesn't need to respond to
their arguments.

Another attempt to explain my opinion:

It's my conviction that it's morally wrong to compare humans with machines,
very much as it is wrong to compare Jews (or any other humans) with flies.

If you do it nonetheless, it is still wrong, because the storage capacity
and the analytical capacity of computers is still fundamentally different
from human memory and mental creativity. It is presposterous to compare our
playing abilities to computers as much as it is presposterous to compare our
jumping abilities to robots. One day computer programs will probably be able
to beat every human player in every abstract game that exists. Would the
consequence be that one day humans will no longer play games competitively?
Apnoe diving is done although seals and robots dive deeper. Why?

Implying that comparing humans with computers makes sense is immature and,
what's more, it is ethically dangerous. I believe that the real problem
people have with computers which are playing better than them is pride
rooted in a wrong and outdated definition of what constitutes being human.
Once only humans were supposed to behave intelligently, now some players of
abstract games want to win an already lost battle by still being at least a
little bit better than computers.  However, neither winning a game, nor
jumping higher is truly the essence of being human. Any attempt to define
our human identity in likewise manner, that is any claim that their must be
something (e.g. at least one game) in which we physically or mentally are
better than any animal or machine (i.e. any affirmative comparison between
humans and computers), is an attack on the value of human life. To define
human identity by insisting on mental superiority (the uneasiness of some
people who dislike the fact that in some games humans are always defeated by
computers is based on this definition) means that the human status of
mentally disabled people who never  ever are able to win even the most
simple game is denied. They are, as a brutal consequence of this wrong
definition of what constitutes a human person, even less human than a pocket
calculator.
That is the reason why I find comparing humans with computers so
unacceptable and offensive.

Comparing computers with humans because both can play games is like
comparing bananas with the moon because both are yellow, but to do the first
is far more inappropriate and even dangerous because humans have a unique
value that can easily be threatened by wrong conceptions of human identity .
