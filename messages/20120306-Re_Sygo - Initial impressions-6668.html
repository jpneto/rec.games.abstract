Some of the connection plays are interesting, and bear a lot of similarities to hex. Have a few groups and you can place some unlikely looking stones and find ways of connecting them up anyway. I'm actually thinking that this game may benefit from a Hex board. The fact that only 6 stones are needed to capture a single stone rather than 8 (you can argue 4 of course, but no-one's going to make single placements just to capture single stones, so extension principles will apply - it's just more burdensome to corner stones and groups off on a square board), and extensions can be in 6 directions rather than 4, and connection is simply rather cuter on a hex board, makes me think the gameplay mechanics are more optimally designed for it.

Do you have a version of Syhex I can play with by any chance? :P

No but that could be arranged. I'm not sure what you suggest though,
Sygo on a hexgrid (whether a hex board or a hexhex board) or Hex with
a Sygo move protocol (that would require quite a large board to be at
all applicable).

As a matter of inclination, for me Go is basically 'square'. It
doesn't even seamlessly translate to the hexgrid. Symple translated
without trouble, but HexSymple doesn't feel quite the same. I
refrained from translating Sygo because othelloanian capture doesn't
create eyespace and six liberties makes that even harder to come by.
You're free to prove me wrong there ;-)

Sygo on hexhex would be very interesting I think, on a reasonably large board (assuming hexhex is a la Havannah). The reason I like the idea in principle is I think growth feels more organic to me on a hex board, and I think the capture dynamics will be neater. In our game, captures occur almost implicitly of separation of non-large groups, so I think draw rates will be low as there will be a lot of mutual separation going on. It also realistically takes 7 stones to create life on either board (without a crazy loss of momentum from a single stone move, which is unlikely to be worth it for a single small group early on). Territories will be smaller, but the inter-group dynamics will be more fluid I think - in our game, once I'd marked out my initial interests I just expanded without much you could do about it. Hex movement allows for a greater variety of interruptions on expansions.

I don't know, I just think there's a certain clumsy albeit unstoppable factor over the orthogonal growth that wouldn't be present on a hexhex board.

I have a suspicion that this game will be a "reasonable" Go variant, but an "excellent" go/hex hybrid, prior to actually playing the latter of course :D
