Rules for Mancala:

Object: Get as many stones into your big bin (mancala) as possible.

Set Up: With the board between you and your opponent, fill all of the 
small bins with the same number of stones (a recommended starting number 
is 3 or 4 with more advanced players up to 7).

Play: The 1st player picks up the stones in any of his bins (the ones on 
his side of the board) and sows them, one at a time, in a 
counter-clockwise direction around the board, including his own mancala, 
but not his opponents.  If the last stone placed is in his own mancala, 
then he gets another turn.  If the last stone is placed in an empty bin 
on his side of the board he captures all the stones in his opponents bin 
directly opposite.  All captured stones plus the capturing stone are 
place in the player's mancala.  If the bin opposite is empty, then that 
players turn is over and no captures are made.  Once a player touches the 
stones, he must play them.  Players are not allowed to touvh the stones 
to count them.

Winning: Play ends when one of the players runs out of stones in his 
small bins.  When this happens, his opponent gets to place all remaining 
stones in his small bins in his mancala (it is not always wise to be the 
first player out of stones).  The player with the most stones in his big 
bin wins.  

Note: There are many variations of the game of mancala and this is only 
one of them.

As I said, start out with 3 or 4 stones per bin and work your way up.  
The game I have says the maximim no. of tones per bin is 6, but I think 
that 7 is a better number.  Any way, have fun!
