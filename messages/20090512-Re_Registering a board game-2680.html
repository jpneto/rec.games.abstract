I mean, how it works? Is it necessary to register a game somewhere in
order to own the copyright? Or do you own it just for the sake of
being the first to state the game rules? Is it necessary to formally
state the terms in which you share your game (e.g. "You can tell the
game rules to anyone but you can't make commercial use of them...")?

I guess it works the same with all sorts of intellectual property; the
thing is that I have no idea of how intellectual property works.

If you want protection for the rules themselves, you have to apply for
a patent. If you are content with protection for your particular
expression of the rules, and implementation thereof (such as the
design of the pieces and artwork on the board), then you have it
through copyright without doing anything. No registering necessary.

This means: If someone else thinks of a game identical to yours, you
have no recourse unless you've patented it. Unless they've lifted the
words from your manual verbatim, or photocopied your board, you can't
do anything.

This is well-established case law when it comes to copyrights and
games, one of the few places you can trust them to not rule in the
would-be rights owner's favour. Yes, this goes internationally, too.
Monopoly got local clones in many countries before the official
version was marketed there, these have all (as far as I know) been
ruled legal.

There are several ways you can learn to live with this:

1. Patent the game. This was done for Scrabble, for instance, although
that patent is expired now. Most game companies don't patent their
games because it's very expensive, and you never know if a game will
succeed or not. Most games make little enough money as it is.

2. Build a trademark. Trademarks still enjoy protection: You can make
a game of world conquest based on rolling dice, but I wouldn't try
calling it Risk (even though "Risk" is a very generic word!).
Trademark protection is really more than enough for many companies: No
one would by my Risk-clone called "World Domination" because they
don't know it's Risk, and I'm not allowed to tell them. These games
don't live on their rules, they live on their names, so protection for
their names are enough (This is also why Hasbro, when they make an
original game, usually tie it in to one of their established names).

3. Build your own name. The German Game Inventor's Guild, in large
part driven my the American game designer Alex Randolph, got through
that designers would be credited on the game box. This in large part
inspired the board game boom in Germany, because customers now had
another way to decide whether to give a game a chance: whether it was
made by a designer they liked. Also, since designer reputation really
matters for sales, publishers have to play fairly: You as a publisher
can't just run off with a Knizia design, because then you couldn't put
Knizia's name on it, and it wouldn't sell nearly as well. Not to
mention it would get you immensely bad press, and you probably would
never get another offer from a Game Inventor's Guild member, ever.
