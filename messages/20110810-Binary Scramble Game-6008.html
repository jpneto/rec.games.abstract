Here is a game for any plural number of players.

A list of 0's and 1's is written on a piece of paper by the players
taking turns, each player appending a 0 or a 1 onto the right side of
the list each turn. After a predetermined number of turns (which is a
multiple of the number of players), the first part of this game is
over.

In the second part of the game, the players take turns rewriting the
entire list each turn with one digit the player chooses flipped from 0
to 1 or from 1 to 0.

The new list cannot match any list previously arrived at during the
game.

If the lengths of the runs of 0's and 1's form a permutation of the
lengths of the runs from any previous list, then the currently moving
player gets a point.

(It doesn't matter if a particular run-length, an element in the
permutation, was for a run of 0's or for a run of 1's.)

The game continues until either a player first achieves a
predetermined score or until no more moves are possible.

The player with the greatest score wins.


Example game (to start):

001110101 (start: 2,3,1,1,1,1)
000110101 (3,2,1,1,1,1 point)
000111101 (3,4,1,1)
000011101 (4,3,1,1 point)
100011101 (1,3,3,1,1)
101011101 (1,1,1,1,3,1,1)
111011101 (3,1,3,1,1 point)
111010101 (3,1,1,1,1,1,1 point)
111010111 (3,1,1,1,3 point)
.... etc.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
