I've received a number of compliments about Tether and I've had to inform
the well wishers individually that Tether has fallen prey to the law that my
most interesting game concepts are also the most vulnerable to flaws.  The
problem with Tether was that there might be no capturing and both players
might not succeed at cordoning off space for themselves.  In that case
Player 1 wins automatically.  Or if it's a pseudo tie with each player
cordining off three spaces for himself, for example, same result.

Looking back it should have been obvious, but sometimes designers get
carried away and this happened here.  I did play test it for a few days but
apparently not enough.

Normally I hate to announce game flaws in a group overrun with hair-trigger
extremists, but now that they're all hiding under their desks, I'm not quite
so reluctant.  I feel like I can breath now.  Ahhhh!

Bill thinks he's punishing me by not talking to me.

  lol  :D

Sorry I clowned on you so much, Bill, but I thought you were gone.

Thumbs up to Mark for honestly analyzing his own game and publicly
announcing this flaw.  I still like the concept of Tether and hope
Mark will find the solution.
