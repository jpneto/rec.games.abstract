Any time after the pattern has been proposed but before the game is
over, the player who did not propose the pattern may stop the game,
and fill in the rest of the board by himself.  If by so doing he
demonstrates that the given pattern is not YMMV, he instantly wins.

Nick, that would be the ideal game in a parallel universe where this
group is called rec.games.kludge.  Here's what I'd like to see in your
next game: Interesting new principle embodied in a minimal set of
rules.  No draws or ties.  Equal goals.  No cliche elements like the
Checkers jump, the n-in-a-row winning condition, or a board full of
pawns racing to the other side.  I guess that last condition was
covered by "interesting new principal".  I'm 100 percent confident you
can do it if you want to.  If it takes ten years it'll be worth the
wait, but I'm sure it wouldn't take you nearly that long.

heh.  I agree it's awkward.  My only defense is that sometimes kludges
lead to not-kludges.  I prefer to think of it as a work in progress
rather than a failure!

I don't think of MN or this latest variant as failures.  I'm just
saying I think you have the potential to do something really
interesting - something that's robust and symmetric.
