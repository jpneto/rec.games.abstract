Greetings and salutations,

	About ten years ago, while enjoying one of my frequent attacks
of utmost idiocy and extreme silliness, I came up with a game. It's a
board game like chess, checkers, go etc. etc. During the years I 
sincerely became to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>hate<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> this game, because I just can't build it. 

I've written a couple of simulations, running on a computer, but that's
no fun at all, I want a real board; a real game. Allow me to explain
the rules of this game I detest so much.

The board consists of eleven by eleven squares. Both players start off
with eleven pieces. Every piece has a value, a so called `strength'.
This is the initial board configuration:

		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |1b|  |1b|  |1b|  |1b|  |1b|  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |2b|  |  |2b|  |  |2b|  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |3b|  |  |  |3b|  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |5b|  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |5w|  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |3w|  |  |  |3w|  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |2w|  |  |2w|  |  |2w|  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |1w|  |1w|  |1w|  |1w|  |1w|  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

The aim of the game is reaching the other side of the board with one
piece. A move is simple -- one move consists of moving exactly one
piece one square to the left, right, forward or backwards. The opponent's
pieces cannot be captured, unlike e.g. chess or checkers.

There are two ways to `block' an opponent's piece:

- a physical block, i.e. if a square is occupied by a piece, one cannot
  move another piece to that particular square.

- `strength blocking'; if the sum of the strengths of the opponent's
  pieces on a destination row is at least equal to the sum of the
  strengths of your own pieces on the row of the current position of
  a piece, the piece is effectively blocked. An example:

		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |  |  |5b|  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |5w|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

  white cannot move her/his piece forward, 'cause the strengths are equal.

		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |1b|  |5b|  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
		|  |  |  |5w|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
		+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

  there are two reasons why white cannot move forwards: there's a 
  physical block (1b) and there's not enough strength to move
  forwards (5w &lt; 1b+5b == 6b).

The value (or strength) of a piece is not fixed. If a piece with
strength `n' moves backwards beyond row `n' (or 12-`n' in case
black moves backwards), its value will degrade, according to the
following sequence: 5-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1. Note that a piece has at least a
strength of one. 

If a piece with strength `n' moves <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>forwards<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> `n' rows (relative
to the starting position) its value will upgrade according to the
following sequence: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;8. Note the fibonacci sequence BTW.

There's a third situation where the value of a piece may decline.
Every piece has a life span of eleven turns. If, a piece is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> 
moved, its life span goes down one generation (or move). Note that
after a move all but one pieces have their life span reduced. If
a piece <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> moved, its life span is restored to eleven turns again.

The adjustment of the value and the life spans is done <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a
piece has moved. The opponent's pieces are only updated after s/he
made her/his move. A piece with a strength of one receiving a life
span equal to zero, must be removed from the board.

Well, this is basically what it's all about -- and I really would
like to build a real, cheap, portable game board. But there's one
small problem however: how do I build a thingy like this? Do I have
to stick some `intelligence' in all 22 pieces and build in something
like 22 connectors in that board; or is it a better idea to make
those pieces out of glass (or something else, transparent) and display
all the necessary information (value and life span) from underneath.
This alternative needs 121 display `units', one per square of the
board. But how do I detect the presence or absence of a piece then?

I'd appreciate any tips, pointers, whatsoever that'll help me build
this terrible game I became to hate so much ;-) Although I'm posting
to these group (rec.games.[design|abstract]), I'm not so sure whether
or not my site receives them both; so, could you please send me an e-mail
copy of your reply/follow-up too? I'll post a summary if there's
enough interest or I'll send you one through e-mail if you prefer.
Just drop me a mail. 

And for now -- thank's y'all in advance and have a good one,
