I'm cross-posting to rec.games.abstract again. The reason for this being that I'm not only interested in board games. 
I'm also interested in other types of games such as role-playing, abstract games, and even continous state-space games 
like real-time strategy.

Thanks for the pointer. I'll try to keep checking r.g.board regularly. But please explain me something.. what's a "big 
8" group? Also, you'd be surprised how many people are interested in games research/theory... worldwide. The university 
of Alberta, for instance, has a research group solely concentrated on games: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games</a>. The IGDA 
has spawned an "academia" section, and there have been many books (eg. "Games of No Chance", "Simple Games", "More Games 
of No Chance", etc.) written on these subjects.

You might be interested in the Journal of Boardgame Studies.

I am not certain that it is still published but it does have some
email contact info on these pages that might help you. This seems to
deal a lot with historical and cultural aspects of board games but it
claims to be multidisciplinary so it might cover what you are
interested in.
