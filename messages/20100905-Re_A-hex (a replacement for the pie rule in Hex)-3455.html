Hey Mark, it looks like I'm Corey Clark's latest target.  After
posting some critical questions about a game of his, a game that is a
derivative of Amazons and Hex, he responded very defensively, and has
now copied my critical comments word for word, replacing his game with
a game I posted, and stuck it in the comment sections of my game.  I
wasn't sure what to make of your problems with him, but it's clear
now.  Too bad, because Particle Bond is an excellent original game,
and I have said this before and publicly, but Corey apparently has a
very selective input filter.  To the world of abstract gamers, think
twice before you disagree with or criticize Corey Clark.  He loves
praise, though.
