&lt;..&gt; we can, however, make an observation that may or
may not help finding a strategy: You can permute the rows and columns
as much as you like without changing the win/lose property of a
position.  This isn't hard to verify: You first realise that a single
swap of two columns or rows doesn't change the property, and then by
induction you show that this applies to any number of swaps.

We can, however, not just sort the rows and columns by size and then
look at the number of stones in the rows and columns.  For example:

   XX           XX
     X   and   X
   X           X

Both have the sequences 2,1,1 both vertically and horisontally, but
the first pattern is a first-player win (by removing the top row) and
the second pattern is a 2nd player win (as the 2nd player can mirror
the first player's moves over the diagonal).

One can generate 'irreducible' representations by:
1) removing empty rows and columns,
2) swap columns and rows such that a 'block-diagonal' configuration is
reached with the rows and columns in each block ordered by size, and
3) splitting the resulting configuration into 'non-interacting blocks'

So, starting from these two configurations:

X . X . .    and   . X . . .
.. . . . X          . . . . .
.. . . . .          . . X . X
X . . . .          . X . . .
.. . . . .          . . . . .

we eliminate the empty rows and columns to reach:

X X .        X . .
.. . X        . X X
X . .        X . .

(i.e. the two configurations given by Thorben), and swap rows and
columns resulting in:

X X .        . X X
X . .        X . .
.. . X        X . .

and represent both in the form of 'non-interacting positions':

(X X) + (X)     and      (X) + (X X)
(X .)                    (X)

Of course, standard theory applies and each non-interacting position
can be represented by a Groundy number:

  (.) -&gt; 0

  (X) -&gt; 1

(X) = (X X) -&gt; 2
(X)

(X X)  
(X .) -&gt; 3

and Groundy numbers of non-interacting positions can be added using
Nim-addition. Positions that have a composite Groundy number (=
Nim-sum of the Groundy numbers of the irreducible configurations)
equal to 0 are 'cold' positions (last players win), all other
positions are 'hot (next players win).
