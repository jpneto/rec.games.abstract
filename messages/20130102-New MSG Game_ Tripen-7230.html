New MSG Game: Tripen

Of the three variable orientation cell division connection games presented so far, Tripen is by far my (admittedly biased) favorite.  It uses a standard, honeycomb tessellation, and the only impurity is an asymmetric token.  Something has to give in the pursuit of VOCD (vehement obsessive compulsive disorder).

I do like Luis' game, Trisq.  It introduces a clever, new mechanism for handling the crosscut issue, if perhaps a tad involved.  After my initial charge of draw susceptibility in Trisq, I've reversed my stance and now no longer believe draws are possible.  I hope I'm not proved wrong twice  :)

Btw, most people want to eventually become wealthy.  When and if you ever make it, be prepared to be resented by those who haven't made it yet and probably never will (practically everyone), simply because you're rich and they aren't.

"Must be nice."

YES, IT IS!

"I have to work a shit-ass 9 to 5 just to make rent."

TOUGH CRAP!  KEEP FLIPPIN' THOSE BURGS, GREASEBALL!  AND DON'T FORGET TO MOP THE BATHROOM URINE PUDDLE!  CHOP CHOP!
