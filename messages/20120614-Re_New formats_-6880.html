I didn't read the first rule sheet because it said it wasn't completed, and the second one I didn't understand.  I need to see diagrams.

Good feedback. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://xifeng.posterous.com/yusailo-updated-rules">http://xifeng.posterous.com/yusailo-updated-rules</a>

I'll see if I can't finish A3G. Everything is worked out except some details of the scoring.

I read over the rules and I'm not clear on some stuff.

The winning condition?
I'll assume that the winner is the one who still has a valid move to make aka the loser has no moves left.  I wouldn't use the verb "place" for spot since you're drawing it.  Also the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>spots being connected to 3 other spots<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is confusing since loads of spots are connected by lines.

Are these the rules?

If you are able to make a legal move,
1. Draw a line or curve that begins at one of your own spots and ends on any spot with 2 or less lines connected to it without crossing over a line.
2. Draw a spot of your type somewhere along that line.

If you are not able to make a legal move,
1. You lose
