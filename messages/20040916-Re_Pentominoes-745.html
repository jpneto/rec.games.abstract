David Parlett recently asked:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Can anyone advise me as to a cheap and foolproof way of making sets of
pentominoes that are accurate and dimensionally stable, based on squares of
about 25 mm each? Cutting them out of balsa wood or thick cardboard is not 100
per cent reliable - at least, not in my hands.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As another poster mentioned, there are sets available commercially.  Here in
the US they are hard to find.  About ten years ago "Natural Wonders" (a
store that was in most shopping malls) carried inexpensive double sets
punched out of sturdy foam.

Legos also work pretty well, but you don't have a lot of choices for size.
Two-by-two-nub squares are about 5/8 inch per side.  I think this is 16 mm
(I am not metrified).  If that's true, 3x3 nubs would be close to your
desired size, but it might be difficult to find the parts to make them with
a 3x3 basis.  For your purposes, the thickness might also be annoying, and
the visual difference between the top and bottom sides of the pieces might
also be annoying.

If you want to make a lot of sets, you could commission someone with a laser
cutter to do it.  Or you could find someone to make a die which you could
then use to cut the pieces out of cardboard using one of those ~ $100
rolling punches that are available in scrapbook stores.  Dies aren't cheap
though.

Hope that helps,
Bob H


Side note: I recently made a set of the solid heptominoes from Legos, which
fit together in 3D very nicely.  See
