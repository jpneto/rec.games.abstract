Basic principle: When you lose excessively, you tend to blame the game.  It's the game's fault, in this case Hex Oust.

Conversation between me and Corey Clark (Liberte) about HO extracted from the Game Site X chat:

Me&gt; In truth, I understand your reluctance. God Jackson used to beat me all the time at HO, and eventually I couldn't handle it and quit playing for a long time. It's a brutal game to lose once. Never mind continually.

Corey&gt; Seriously I just think it's turned into a different game now. It had a quality of asceticism back in the day and now it's all kill kill kill.

Me&gt; Seriously, you're demonstrating a fundamental principle. When you lose, you find fault with the game. It's the game's fault.

The comeback [in HO] is still very much alive. The strategy is richer for Raph's influence. He won one against me and lost one against me. I incorporated his strategy, not mimicked it.

You haven't won once since Raph. Win five times and tell me there's something wrong with the game.

Speaking of Raph, the loss was a tough blow. He spent a 1/2 hour on his last move when it was clearly over. Basic denial.

Btw it isn't "kill kill kill" now. It only seemed like that when you were hell bent on going minimal with no thought to the enemy structure. You just have to think more now.

Correction.  After Raph, and after Corey suffered a huge losing streak, one day I was out of sorts (if you can possibly imagine) and playing terribly all day.  Corey won once and played again immediately.  Not the slightest hesitation.  He won the second game and then played again later in the day, breaking his self imposed limit of two HO games per day.  He won the third game, noting that his limit of two was really a limit of two losses - **totally proving my point**.  Don't blame the game.

After that, Corey embarked on another withering losing streak and has now abandoned HO because it no longer has "asceticism", lol.

Basically it's time to move up to a larger board, from base 7 to base 8, since a game can now essentially end in about 35 moves (though it can still go well over 100).  A larger board was long anticipated, at least by me, and will only enhance the tactical array.

I'll need some new recruits though.  I keep a board open every day at iggc while I practice the sax.  I can't watch the board continually, so if you stop in to play, don't say "hi" and run off after 30 seconds.  Give me ten minutes to notice your arrival.

Eventually a smart player with cojones will happen along, lose a few times, and then win, advancing the strategy.  So far the list of casualties, dumped in a roadside gully, include God Jackson, Corey Clark, and Raph.  All of them contributed to my understanding of the game, so I guess thanks for that [shaking head].
