In sprouts, either you are able to analyse the position fully (when 
either you know that you have a won position, or you know that your 
opponent has a won position but you can hope that he goes wrong), or you 
can't and the move that you make might as well be random.

Isn't this statement true of all abstract games, not just sprouts?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, certainly not.  Most abstract games that people actually play have
approximate evaluation functions, e.g., adding up material in chess, or
pip count in backgammon, etc., which can easily be used to rank moves
without analyzing the game all the way out to the end.  There's no
reason you need to figure out who is winning to know that you should
generally recapture your opponent's queen when the opponent initiates an
exchange of queens.

(Note: this question is semi-rhetorical, in that I have my own reason
why it is not even true for sprouts.)

Well, I have no idea what "semi-rhetorical" means.  If you did have a
point, why not just make it?
