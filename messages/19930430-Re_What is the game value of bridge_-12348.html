Let's see if I can start to answer your questions by defining some terms.
First of all, I assume by "game value" you mean a number of points that
a particular player is expected to win.  For example, in chess the big
question is whether the game value to white is 1 or 0.5.  That is, does
playing first guarantee a win for white or only a draw?  (Some Sicilian
players I once knew said it guaranteed a loss :-))

In theory this is easy to answer for chess.  Simply write out the whole
game tree and choose the best moves for both players and look at the
result.  'Course the tree has more nodes than atoms in the universe,
but at least the technique is clear.

In bridge things aren't so straightforward.  First, a single bridge hand
is not a bridge event.  Bridge is played as clusters of hands.  In "rubber"
bridge, n hands are played until one player scores two "games".  In
"Chicago", four hands are played in one "chucker".  In "pairs" 24-30 hands
are played and scored across all players playing the same hands.  And in
"teams of four", a team plays a match of between 6 and 160 hands against
another team.  So what "game value" means is going to differ depending on
form.

Let's take "Chicago" as an example.  Each pair (playing together) gets
to bid first in two deals and second in two deals.  It is not like chess,
where one player moves first and the effect of that lives throughout the
game.  (In fact, if you play two chuckers then all of the subtle things
[vulnerability for example] are completely equal.)  In this case it is
clear that Chicago is a "fair" game.  That is neither pair is at an
advantage.

Don't forget that bridge is a game of partial information, based on
random draw of cards.  Bridge contains two main elements: bidding to a
contract and playing the cards at that contract. So, in bridge the interesting 
questions involve which bidding system is better, which way to play a 
particular hand is better, etc.  In fact there is a major disagreement in the 
international bridge community between advocates and despisers of so-called
"destructive" bidding systems.  A destructive system takes advantage of the 
times when your side bids first to take bidding room away from the opponents.  
Some people consider it unfair, others consider it just using the rules to 
gain an advantage.

I hope this gives some insights.  I'd be interested in hearing if anyone
had specific examples where game theory was applied to bridge, especially
in bidding.
