We're not on undisputed terms either, but neither would I - of course
I'd need a game to vote for first ;-)
Other than that, I don't think even Bill Taylor would consider Grabber
any diferent from say Clobber or Kanone. I don't think it's healthy to
have a 'we-among-us' atmosphere invading RGA.

I think it's just poor sportsmanship to enter a contest,
expect to have a vote and then not even properly review the other
entries. Unless you have the divinity of a Chris Freeling (no you're
not off the hook CF ;) ) all you can gauge  from a game's rules is its
architecture and maybe some vague tactical ideas. Whether or not
playing each entry is a stipulation of having a vote I personally
intend to play them all at least once otherwise I wont feel as though
I've earned to right to vote.

My divinity tells me that two of the entries are puzzle-like
constuctions lacking any 'organic' features. It's not a value
judgement, but I simply don't have any affinity with them.
For the four remaining ones there are applets available, or there will
be by March 1.
Barring new entries, for me the choice will be between these four and
I intend to play them all against humans and/or bots as the case may
be, as often as possible.

Maybe we could get voters to write quick game session summaries or to write some sort of analysis that would demonstrate a certain level of understanding of the game.

Personally I have no objections to make my vote and its motivation
public, even if it is not required.

yeah it sure is pretty but it seems kind of pointless to me, unless
you're into that new age shit... I don't really care. If I don't have
my entry prepared by march 20th it aint coming.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

March 1 actually, if we go by Daniels latest post, March 20 for the
votes. New Age has nothing to do with picking a date. If everyone's
aware that entries for the yearly contest should be submitted by March
1, then the only thing that remains is picking a theme for next year.
