Why would you?

Volo is soft-finite, that is, the 'opponents' would have to cooperate
with perpetual capuring cycles as their common goal to show its
infinity.
Of course they would no longer be 'opponents', hence they would play a
non-zero sum game, not Volo.

So in my opinion it's a non-issue.

Inventors who on dogmatic grounds would rather alter the game into
hard-finitude, in fact seem to start from the premiss that players are
stupid.

I've argued before that being finite, drawless and balanced is neither
necessary nor sufficient to make a great game. It's not even a
particularly interesting criterion. If a great game happens to comply,
it makes a great footnote, but gameplay is the essential criterion for
a game.
