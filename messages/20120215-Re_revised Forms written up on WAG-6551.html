From your words, I assume that Forms is the kind of game where the
strategy lies not so much in definite signposts along the way, but in
optimizing some more "prosaic" parameters of the position in your
favour, namely mobility and material. Is that so? I can barely see the
differences between these two alleged kinds of games myself, but I
hope you get the idea :)

I've posted my reply to your comments on Loose in the Loose thread, so
as not to derail this one.

I would agree with that.  In addition to material and mobility, there
is also "self -detachability" --- the ability to detach your own
pieces from themselves to make a slide move.  Without acquiring some
self-detachability, you are reliant on your opponent to open the door
for you to make a slide move.
