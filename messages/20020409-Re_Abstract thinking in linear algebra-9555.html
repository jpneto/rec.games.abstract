1.  I wish I could see logic and math taught together ... throw in a
little set theory too... at the high school level, and carried through
at each step of the way.

This was tried while I was going through school. I was
drawing Venn diagrams in first grade. I think the experiment
by and large was regarded as a failure. For one thing, the
abstract stuff was emphasized and basic arithmetic was
dropped. That led to kids who can't take 10% of a bill in their
heads. And nobody can make change anymore.

The failure of this experiment has more to do with teachers NOT
understanding the abstract stuff AND to a certain extent, droping the basic
arithemetic.  But does not explain what Johnny can't do math today.  It has
more to do with the state of the public school system than with the
textbooks.  But this is the wrong forum for this discussion.
