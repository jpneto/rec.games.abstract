A long time ago we used to do things like that with dice to
sim multi-siders we didn't have. You would roll a d6 and a
d10. If the d6 = 1,2, or 3, the d10 roll stood. If the d6 =
4,5, or 6, you added 10 to the d10 roll, giving yourself a
flat "20" sider. With 2d6's you could fake a d10. The first
was low end/high end, while the second was 1-5 (6's rerolled
due to out of range.) Clunky, but it worked okay when the
only 10 siders cost $1 a piece, only came as part of a set,
and then only via a 3-4 week snail mail parcel post. Ahhhh,
the good old days. ;-)

I preferred my trusty programmable HP calculator. The 10-series (I had an
11C, my brother a 15C) was so tough that it could constantly fall out of my
shirt pocket (with no case) and keep on working. It was also smaller than
what came before it and what came after.

The good old days indeed. Now I have to carry around a laptop.
