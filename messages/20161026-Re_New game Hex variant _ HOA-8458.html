This game too was plagiarized by a dumb game designer in bgg.
People are deeply dishonest at bgg.
They are spending their time copying-pasting ideas of others.
Why?
Because they are incompetent! They are unable to imagine new games.
So hey are stealing an idea without even trying to understand the core of the new idea.
To hide their robbery they mix the new idea in a some sort of "intellectual" bullshit. Dumb people will never see the link. Or even if they see it they are going to say that the new crappy game created has nothing to do with my idea. You talked about capture and there is no capture in my game ha ha ha ha ha ha 
It is laughable.
My brain is "pregnant" of 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 new and original ideas.
So fuck you!
