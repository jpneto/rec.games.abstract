(Is this game original? I myself may have come up with something
similar earlier.)

This is a game for 2 players.

You have an n-by-n grid drawn on paper (as almost always). n should be
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
= 8, I suggest.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In the first part of the game, the players take turns placing a total
of n x's into the grid, where one x is placed in an empty square of
the grid each move.

In the second part of the game, players take turns. On a turn, a
player draws a straight line (through the centers of the intervening
squares) either up, right, down, or left from the last x drawn to by
the other player. The line may take at most one right-angle turn. And
it must end at an x not drawn to/from yet. (Player 1 draws from any of
the x's on her/his first move.)

Lines can't pass through a line already drawn in the second part of
the game. And the line cannot pass through an x on its way between two
other x's during a move. The line may, though, share a corner with, or
coincide partially with (both line-segments horizontal or both line-
segments vertical), a line drawn previously during the second part of
the game.

A player must move if it is possible.

The last player able to move LOSES.

(Note: Unlike some other games I have posted recently, more than one x
or no x's at all may be in any row or column.)

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
