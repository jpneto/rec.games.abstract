As some of you may recall, I released a game called Rush in May of
2007.  I had offered the exclusive right to program Rush to one
particular game site, the owner of which accepted my offer and
promised to implement Rush at her earliest convenience.  Now after
nine months of extended delays, the owner of said game site has
reneged on her promise.

I've now rescinded said game site's exclusive right to program Rush
and I hereby release Rush into the public domain.

What a huge waste of time that was.  The owner of said game site had
originally asked me to make my future games exclusive to her site.  I
volunteered to make exactly one game, the next game that I would
design, exclusive to her game site in reciprocation for her promise to
program all of my existing games, which promise was also reneged on.
