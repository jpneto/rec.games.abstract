What if they both miss sozees?  



Interesting idea with the sozees but in practice it's too complicated.  And it's just a flippy game.  Weak.  Plus I don't like the four placements per turn.  It creates turn order advantage.



Overall I'm not impressed.  Sorry.

If you want a game that you like design it.
It`s too complicated for dumb persons.
Anyway if the 2 miss the soozies then there will be no problem. Players are going to continue playing.
Killing all the sozees is designed to prevent cycles.
One day you will discover why 4 are necessary.

Your reaction is always predictible toward any game which is not yours.

Anyway I designed the game for fun to show you that there is a huge space of new capturing systems that no one has explored.

Have you EVER SEEN before my new capturing system?
