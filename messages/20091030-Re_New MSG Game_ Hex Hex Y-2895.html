"Many enough people to try?"  What the fuck does that mean?  "Play
[my] games more than once?"

I haven't spotted a complete list of sites hosting your games, maybe
you've put it somewhere and I've missed it - I don't examine your site
in very much detail, unlike what you imagine... but on the sites I
watch which have statistics, your games get very little play time.
Take your "immortal classic" Tanbo. Since Arty was generous enough to
add it at iggamecenter - and that was quite a while ago - it has been
played a grand total of 27 times. By comparison, "Slime Trail" has
been called 39 times in this month alone.

Despite that, the author of Slime Trail (I think you've met him, ha
ha) doesn't go around pretending it's divinely inspired, or a living
legend of a game. Can you believe it?

(Maybe it's not nice, but I can't resist the temptation of winding
this crank, guys - not after his latest wave of megalomania, "A
designer's perspective"!)
