So it [Mind Ninja] shares one little
property of Hex that in attaining your goal you prevent your opponent
from attaining his.  And it doesn't even fully capture <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
property.  In Hex it's a two way street.  Each player is trying to
form his own given construct and simultaneously trying to prevent the

This is trivially true, if "the player's construct" is defined as
"anything that blocks the other", i.e. G2 = inverse(G1).  What Mind
Ninja fails to capture is the similarity of the goals in a positive
sense, i.e. G2 = rotation(G1).

Exactly, but that's a huge disparity.

Hex to me is and probably always will be the ultimate game.  Not as
something to play but as something to behold.  It's not just any
member of the Atoll set.  It's the simplest member.  If you're going
to come along and proclaim that you've discovered a generalization of
Hex, you better have something serious - not some unequal goals game
where one player is trying to form a smiley face and the other is
trying to prevent it. (Again, not to impugn Mind Ninja.  It's a fine
game and its creator, Nick Bentley, is a fine designer, with whom I've
agreed to disagree about this generalization thing.)

I've spent a lot of time trying to develop 3D connection games played
on a hexagonally tessellated surface and had only marginal success.
For example, if you have a tetrahedron sitting on a flat surface
missing the bottom face you could define the following game: the goal
is to encircle the peak (which could mean just claiming the peak
cell), and extend a line from that circle down to the bottom,
triangular perimeter.  Two problems: It morphs to a 2D game, and
there's a huge first move advantage.  I can't release a game that
requires an nth degree pie rule.  I've designed a number of games
which were geometrically interesting but which never got released.

Torben, if you had succeeded with Torex, I'm not sure what that would
have proved.  You'd have had one very interesting connection game with
an obvious, strong relation to Hex.
