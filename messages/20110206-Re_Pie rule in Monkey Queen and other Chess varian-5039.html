On the pie rule in general:
I stated the pie rule is a
disaster in Monkey Queen, because the costs to the game far outweigh
the benefits, as it could for so many other games.  One way it does
this is by blocking the depth of exploration for 1st player by tying
them to one strategy from the get go.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I not quite agree I'm afraid. In Chess-without-pie exploration has
resulted in main alleys being explored in deep. Deviations at the
borders of the uncharted are taken by grandmasters at their own risk,
as are deviations in charted territory, taken by the lesser gods.
In Chess-with-pie a similar pattern would eventually emerge. Of course
the alleys would be different, but not the way they would be explored.
I agree however that the result could possibly be an increase in the
number of draws.

How good pie rule is depends on
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the following:  How big of an advantage does 1st player have, what
results are possible, do offense and defense exist seperately, what
moves are options for 1st move, is there such a thing as a bad move (a
move that is weaker than no move at all), and what are the
alternatives.

Just fur the fun of it (I don't disagree with what you say), let's put
Havannah in the mix. The pie rule does an excellent job there, despite
not quite fitting the above.

Example 1:  Pie rule in hex
1.  Without pie rule, red has a large (~66%+) advantage, with pie
rule, red has virtually equal chances (~49.5%+)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The same picture in havannah, though numbers change with boardsize.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
2.  Draws are not possible, and offensive and defensive play is
synonymous (building an inevitable win prevents the opponent from
doing the same.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Different on both counts: draws are possible though <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>extremely<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rare,
and a player can have a 'framed win' and lose on a prolongued series
of shorter threats.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3.  Without pie rule, one move (center) is clearly the best, and no
other move is worth considering.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's different too, but it's game-specific. The center in havannah
is playable from both sides, and I use to offer it for swaps more
often than not.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.  There is no such thing as a bad move, and even the worst moves
usually can be made useful as a ladder excape.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True in havannah, but you don't need "a move that's worse than no
move" for a pie, but a move that makes you wonder if it's not worse
than your best answer.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
5.  The game offers one balancing alternative that naturally sprouts
from the rules:  different side lengths.  However, this is not
balanced (red's disadvantage is in the general area as his natural
advantage).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No alternative in havannah either, but have a look please at Symple,
and the mechanism named after it, or Sygo to see its most important
implementation.
