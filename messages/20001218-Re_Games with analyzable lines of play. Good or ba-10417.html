An interesting question.

I also think chess has been "ruined" somewhat for me because of all the
analysis.  I dislike Bridge even more due the bidding conventions (which
is not really the same, but I think it's related somehow).

However, I do like games that could be (and probably are) analyzed, but
don't have this analysis generally known.  For instance, I still enjoy
Pente, but I probably wouldn't enjoy playing against someone who has read
books about it (and not just because they would kick my ass).

A good fix would be to have a random setup but have the rest of the game
completely non-random.  I know there are games out there that do this, but
I can't think of any right now.  Is the "expert" variant of Cartagena like
this?  I haven't played it yet.

On the other hand, I still enjoy Diplomacy quite a bit (my only problem
with it is the length).  I don't get into the analysis that much myself,
but I don't mind at all playing people who do.  However, I think one of
the appeals of the various map variants is that it circumvents the
analysis somewhat.

For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.
