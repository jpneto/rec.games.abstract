Mister Luis you are dumber than Clark

Read this :Will I be able to develop new games in Zillions?

All Zillions games are specified in a powerful, data-oriented, scripting language designed specifically to describe game rules. There are sections for describing pieces, the board, the goals, the help, etc. Scripting is akin to very easy programming. If you have any experience with any programming language, scripting language, or formatting language like HTML, you shouldn't have any trouble writing a Zillions Rules File. If you are good at math and logic, you should be able to figure it out. If you have no experience in things like this, then implementing new games may be beyond you, and you should rely on the games other people are creating.

You'll need the full (unlocked) version to develop new games, but other than that nothing is required. New games are described to Zillions in text files, so all you need to write a new game is a text editor. WordPad will do, but others can highlight keywords for you. Zillions comes with a built-in parser/compiler that will alert you to syntax errors you make and can even detect run-time problems like endless loops.

I knew Zillions of games before you for sure.
So do you think that you are going to impress me by sending an URL?
ha ha ha 
you are really dumb! 
It is like someone who want to show that he is big mathematician by sending me a (fake or real) picture of him talking to TERENCE TAO.
