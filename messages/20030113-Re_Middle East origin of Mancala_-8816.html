Mancala is generally thought to have originated in Africa.  However, a
letter in the new issue of Biblical Archaeology Review (Jan/Feb 2003)
claims that an artifact found in Jericho and dating to the 7th
millennium B.C.E. points to the game's origin in ancient Israel.  Would
anyone with a knowledge of Mancala's history like to comment on this
possibility?

The initial thoughts (prior to reading BAR) is 'crap'.

To summarize:
archaeologists have a notoriously poor reputation at recognising or
describing games and games pieces;
Mancala-type games have historically been played with bits of
pebbles/dung/clay in depressions scooped in the sand 'in situ' leaving
nothing for the archaeologists to discover (even if they popped along a
week after a game was played.

However:
we'd better play fair and look at the evidence - is any part of it on-line
as it's likely to be some weeks (at least) before I can get time in an
academic library with BAR?
