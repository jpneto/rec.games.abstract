I've been considering how to extend this to n-person games, and I
think the following will work:

For simplicity's sake, I will only demonstrate for three player games,

Assume that normally Blue moves first, then Red, then Yellow.  

First, Player 1 makes a move for Blue.  Then Players 2 and 3 say
whether or not they'd like to be Blue.  If both say no, then Player 1
is Blue and the other two use the I-cut-You-choose-first method above
to decide who is Red and who is Yellow.  (With Player 2 as Placer,
making a Red move.)  If just one of them says yes, ...

After the first move, suppose the chances of victory are independent
of the second move and equal to (Blue 70%, Red %20, Yellow 10%).
Player 2 will end up with only a 20% chance.

A related problem ("decision/division") is solved in the rec.puzzles archive
but it seems difficult to apply here.  (N-person games are just difficult
when N &gt; 2.)
