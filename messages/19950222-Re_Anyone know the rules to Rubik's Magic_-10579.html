Can anyone tell me what the rules to the strategy game Rubik's Magic.
I bought a set at a flea market and it didn't have rules with it.  I
have been playing with a set of rules I made that seem to work well,
but I still would like to know what the original rules to the game
are.

Here goes (this is from memory, so may not be entirely accurate):

One player plays circles, the other diamonds.

[Most of the rules deleted]

This is another attempt from memory, but I think it fills in more of the
details than in the last post:

The first move is made by placing one of your own pieces anywhere on the
board, either way up.

Subsequent moves; 
1. Flip an opponent's piece over into an empty, adjacent (not diagonal)
square so that it shows the other colour.  If all your opponent's pieces
are blocked in and cannot be flipped, skip this first stage.   

2. Place one of your own pieces on any free square, either way up.

Those two stages must be taken in that order.

You have only won if a line of three of your own pieces (even diagonally)
of the same colour cannot be broken by your opponent on their turn.  Just
producing the line is not a victory, nor is the creation of a line of your
pieces by your opponent's flip (although if they cannot break it next
turn, they will lose).

I seem to remember that it was impossible to draw, even with the strict
winning requirement above.  If you do find your games tending to
stalemate, I must have mis-remembered something.
