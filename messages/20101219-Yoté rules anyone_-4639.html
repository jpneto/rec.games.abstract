I like Yote because it combines entering with elimination, just like
Emergo and Oust.

However, rules, rules, rules. Lot's of them. The first set even
suggests 6x6 instead of 6x5, but that may be a typo.

First rule set:
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4531552_play-yote-african-checkers.html">&lt;http://www.ehow.com/how_4531552_play-yote-african-checkers.html&gt;</a>
Have one player place one of his pieces on the board.
Have each player take turns placing pieces anywhere on the board, one
at a time, until all pieces have been placed.
Some variations allow players to place their pieces two at a time,
depending on the preference of the players. This feature, yote's
thousands of potential starting positions, provides players with much
of its unique challenge.

Have the other player, the player who was second to place their pieces
in Step 2, make the first move.
Players then move their pieces across the board, and into position to
jump their opponent's pieces. In yote, pieces may only be moved
backwards, forwards, left or right, but not diagonally.

Jump your opponent's pieces. Players may jump more than one piece at a
time, although only in the four directions listed above.
Pieces that have been jumped are removed from the board.
In addition, each jumped piece allows the jumping player to remove one
bonus piece of his choice from the board.

Continue play. A player wins when all but one of his opponent's pieces
are removed from play.

----------
Second rule set:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoté">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoté</a>
The game is played on a five by six board. When the game begins, the
board is empty and each player has twelve pieces in hand. In a move, a
player may either:
- Place a piece in an empty space on the board.
- Move one of their pieces already on the board to an adjacent
orthogonal space.
- Capture an opposing piece by jumping orthogonally to the space
beyond it.
After a capture, a player may remove another opposing piece of their
choice.
The game can end in a draw if both players have three or fewer pieces.

----------
Third rule set:
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9385/yote">&lt;http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9385/yote&gt;</a>
Yoté is a traditional African capturing game in the Checkers family.
It's played on a 5x6 board with 12 pieces per player and no standard
setup, instead the players take turns placing their stones. Captures
are made by jumping. In addition one can have the ability to jump
multiple pieces. (A player that has just captured a opponents piece
can capture another piece for each piece jumped.)

----------
Fourth rule set (summary rather):
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/266025/rules">&lt;http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/266025/rules&gt;</a>
Rules we have are: place a piece or move a piece, or jump an opponents
piece. Take one extra piece for every piece captured. Until no further
moves are possible.

----------
Fifth rule set:
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/yote.htm">&lt;http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/yote.htm&gt;</a>
On each turn, each player may either deploy a stone from the reserve
to any empty space on the board, or move a stone on the board.
Stones move either by sliding to one adjacent orthogonal cell, or by
jumping over and capturing an opponent stone next to them in one of
those directions.
When a Stone captures another stone, the player may then select any
other opponent stone on the board (but not in their opponent's
reserve) and capture it as well.
A player may continue to jump enemy stones with the piece it has moved
until it run out of stones to jump; however, captures are not
mandatory.
- Wins the player who capture all of his opponents stones.
- If either player is unable to move, then the game ends and the
player with the most stones remaining wins.
- If both players are reduced to three or less Stones, then the game
is a draw.

QUESTIONS

Entering/Moving

First set separates entering and moving stage, no other set does.
Only possible in first set: second player moves first after entering
stage. Does this mean that he can enter a piece so that it attacks,
and next capture with it because he goes first?
First set mentiones 1-2-2- ... entering. That would mean that the
first to enter is also the last to enter, and the second player moves
first naturally, that is: turns simply keep alternating.
So is the 'second player moves first' rule only intended for this
variant I wonder?

Multiple capture

First, third and fifth set mention it explicitly, fourth is unclear,
and second, wiki, doesn't mention it at all and implicitly even
forbids it.
Nothing is mentioned about the order. It's obviously not "complete
capture first, then remove", so it's the "dog on a cookie trail"
method.
But do I capture 'x' stones, then remove 'x' more, or do I capture
one, remove one, capture one, remove one ...
The latter of course allows removing a stone that blocks a capture,
something not possible in the former.

The end

First set:
"A player wins when all but one of his opponent's pieces are removed
from play."
Question: Even if he has only one himself?

Fifth (second) set:
"If both players are reduced to three or less Stones, then the game is
a draw."

Fifth set:
"If either player is unable to move, then the game ends and the player
with the most stones remaining wins."
If "<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> player is ...", so if I block a player who has more
stones I lose?

Does anyone know more sources or does anyone actually know the rules?

cheers,

christian
