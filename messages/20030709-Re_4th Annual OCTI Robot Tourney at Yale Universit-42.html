The 4th Annual Octi Robot Championship will take place at Yale
University again this December.  We've had fun and some fascinating
games in years past (see the game archive at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a>), and all
are welcome to join us again this year.

&lt;big snip&gt;

Feel free to contact me (Don Green) with question or comments:

Cheers,

I hadn't looked at your website for a couple of months. After I saw this
post I did. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Java applet robot capable
of playing Octi (formerly Octi for Kids). I'd never played Octi before,
since I'd owned Octi Extreme (formerly Octi) for over two years. At first I
was put off because I wouldn't be able to use the superprong and the endless
board of the game I was used to. And I scoffed after I won the first two
games I played. Then I noticed the difficulty setting. It began on level 5.
I moved it to 6, still too easy. But when I put it on 7 the robot won nine
of the next 12 games. I scoffed no more. I'd found my niche.

Anyway, thanks for this addition to your website. I hope that sometime in
the future you'll have a robot for Octi Extreme.
