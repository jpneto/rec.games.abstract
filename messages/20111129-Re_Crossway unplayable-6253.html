If you really want to learn Crossway, Nihlus, something I would
consider a noble endeavor, study with the Wamster.  I can't contact
the Wamster because he doesn't like me, inexplicably.  But I think
you'll find him friendly and accommodating.

How much spoon feeding do you need in life, Nihlus?  "I need examples
and explanations!"  "I can't win; therefore this game sucks!"  What a
baby.

It's not enough I provide free games.  I gotta change your diaper and
wipe your butt.

Who is Wamster?

Probably, he doesn't like the Californian Scrabble.

To the contrary. I win too easily, even against myself; therefore... I
am looking for hints and examples that will make this game last
longer, give it some suspense. Something, anything. But just hiding
behind the pie rule is pathetic.

Appreciated.

I take it as an excess of courtesy. What I only understand is that
Crossway stands out from the crowd. If it did not I would not as much
as spit on it let alone start a post. Just need to know if it is
playable. Too many games out there. There is a potential in it but it
may not be enough. 5 in a row has a potential but is skewed. Connect6
uses the same idea and is perfect. Things are proved in the gameplay
not just by the rules. This is so called human factor.
