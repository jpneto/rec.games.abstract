  Another game that you can play with M&amp;Ms: matching-coins
and its variations.  One variant that I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> bother to
analyze, and even wrote a computer player for, back in the
day:

  Materials: A big bag of M&amp;Ms, black and white, to use
as "cards", and another couple bags of M&amp;Ms to use as chips.
Some sort of shield for the cards more secure than your
sweaty little palms.

  Play: Each player draws two "cards," which he must keep
secret from the other player(s?).  He looks at them.  He
bets some chips.  And the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>number<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of chips he bets, must
be equal to the number of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>black M&amp;Ms<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> he expects to find in
the hands of both players combined.
  If one player bets correctly and the other wrong, the first
player gets all the chips in the pot.  Otherwise, both bets
go into the pot for the next round of cards.
  You may eat your winnings.

  Example:

Player 1 is dealt one white and one black M&amp;M.  He bets 2.
Player 2 is dealt two white M&amp;Ms.  He bets 0.
  The total black M&amp;Ms is 1; both players lose; Player 1's two M&amp;Ms
go into the pot.
Player 2 is dealt two black M&amp;Ms.  He bets 0.
Player 1 is dealt one white and one black M&amp;M.  He bets 1.
  The total is 3; Player 2 has bluffed (at no cost to himself, I
might add)!  Player 1's one M&amp;M goes into the pot, which is now at 3.
Player 1 is dealt two white M&amp;Ms.  He bets 1.
Player 2 is dealt one white and white black M&amp;M.  He bets 2.
  The total is 1; Player 1 wins all 6 M&amp;Ms in the pot (3 from before,
plus his own 1 back again, plus 2 from Player 2).

  ...and so on.  A very simple game that's easy to analyze with
those little strategy tables, and easy to sharp at with a good random
number generator.

  Variations might allow the players to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>choose<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> their cards from
their winnings, before betting; thus making the rarer color of M&amp;M a
valuable "natural resource." :)  I haven't really thought out that
version, though.
