Can someone post more information of this match? Has it started?  
With all the excitement of the past days, we have neglected to 
discuss this match.  What are Lafferty's past accomplishments?
How does he compare with  Tinsley?  If Tinsley can barely
win against Chinook, does Lafferty stand any chance?    

Jonathan Scheaffer mentions : 'Tinsley and Lafferty are the only 2
humans with more than 1 win to their credit against Chinook.'  
Can we have more information on the previous Chinook-Lafferty 
encounter(s) ?  Has Chinook 'progressed' since then?

Go Lafferty!
(Although I have nothing against Mr. Schaeffer and his team,
I would still like to see the human win this man-machine match.)
