<br>They will, as at present, accept them when the alternative is

<br>Changing the scoring system does nothing to change the underlying

<br></blockquote>
<br>That's not the underlying problem. Players <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>will<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be in the mood
<br>to play on and look for winning chances if that's what is
<br>sensible in the meta-game. The vast majority of games/sports
<br>etc. simply don't have an "I'm not in the mood, let's draw" option
<br>and neither would chess with sensible scoring. It's especially
<br>offensive that this occurs in the last round of every major
<br>tournament -exactly when, in ordinary non-chess competitions,
<br>the drama is at its highest.

<br>I don't know what sort of chess you play, but I don't know
<br>any players to whom that does not already apply.&nbsp; For a start, we
<br>all, except for the merest beginners, often play against players
<br>who are worse than us.&nbsp; That is especially true for the world's
<br>strongest players.&nbsp; If a GM sits down to play me, do you suppose
<br>he is looking to "hold the draw"?&nbsp; So we all need repertoires that
<br>give us a decent chance to win against slightly or very inferior
<br>opposition, whatever the colour.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Irrelevant. Nothing says that they have to play the same
<br>openings against weaker players as they do against their peers,
<br>and frankly I'd be surprised if that were the case.

<br>Well, it mucks up rating.&nbsp; Either ratings can't follow the

<br></blockquote>
<br>In what sense is watching live football "extreme"?&nbsp; The
<br>fact remains that live chess, unlike most [all?] physical sports,
<br>and many mind sports, is utterly opaque to any spectator who is
<br>not of comparable ability with the players.&nbsp; That's not to say
<br>that we can't have TV programs about it;&nbsp; but it's not going to
<br>have mass spectator appeal.
<br></blockquote>
<br>So what? It can have more appeal than it currently does.
<br>It can appeal to amateur chessplayers, at least.
<br>

<br><blockquote type=cite>Go is considered more complex than chess, but seems to
<br>have bigger purses.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Are you talking about popularity or money?&nbsp; If you want
<br>money, then you need sponsorship [whether through TV, or patrons,
<br>or government assistance], or else you are limited to what the
<br>contestants/spectators themselves put in.&nbsp; Sponsorship is just
<br>too fickle to draw many conclusions from it.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Sponsorship is almost always connected with popularity.
<br>There aren't that many eccentric millionaires throwing
<br>money around. My understanding is that Go has
<br>significant corporate sponsorship.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>TV picks things
<br>up, then drops them.&nbsp; Sports like snooker and darts go through
<br>cycles of boom and bust, in financial terms, as they move from
<br>pubs and clubs into the limelight, then companies move in and
<br>sponsors, TV coverage, equipment deals and so on bring lots of
<br>money, then everyone gets bored.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cable stations are filled up with
<br>"contest" shows for all sorts of activities: fishing, cooking, singing,
<br>dancing, not to mention lots of made up "sports" invented by a TV
<br>producer that have no players whatsoever.
<br></blockquote>
<br>No doubt.&nbsp; But they are all "contests" and "sports" that
<br>have visual appeal and are easy to explain to the punters.&nbsp; Even
<br>if, as in dancing, only the experts can really tell you how good
<br>the contestants are, nevertheless the TV contests usually have a
<br>"popular vote".
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>By the way, I am not convinced that playing wouldn't
<br>also be improved by a less draw-favorable attitude.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You mean that the players who are more aggressive and who
<br>rarely draw are likely to be better than those who quite often
<br>draw?&nbsp; Well, there are examples of both styles at every level of
<br>play, both historically and currently.&nbsp; If you were right, or if
<br>the converse were true, then you would expect evolution to lead
<br>to almost all top players being one style, or perhaps to the top
<br>players being a different style from the club players.&nbsp; In fact,
<br>chess seems to favour a diversity of styles.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>When I looked at tournaments like Linares and Corus,
<br>it was astonishing how consistent the draw rate has been.
<br>Players have evolved to succeed in the current (draw favorable)
<br>system. Change the scoring system, and my guess is that
<br>most of the same players will still be at the top, but to succeed
<br>their style will have to adapt to something that is more
<br>interesting. Is it possible that some players who succeed in
<br>drawtopia would be unable to adapt to higher levels
<br>of contestedness? Sure, but I don't see that as a negative.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>[...] You seem to me to be barking up the wrong tree.
<br></blockquote>It is unclear. Elementary school chess
<br>has large numbers and almost no draws. Participation
<br>drops with age as the draw rate increases.
<br></blockquote>
<br>As has been pointed out, correlation is not causality.&nbsp; I'm
<br>sure we can all think of more likely reasons for teenagers to give
<br>up chess than learning that Kramnik has just played a short draw.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>My experience is that when the kids see the adult game, they
<br>don't like what they see. I think the draw-worshipping
<br>culture is certainly a component of that. But I certainly agree
<br>that there are other factors.
