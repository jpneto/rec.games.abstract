I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon
style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.

Storm Over Arnhem (Avalon Hill) had something strategically similar
(in a way) called the initiative chit.  Whoever held it could call for
a re-roll of the dice at any time...but then the chit was handed to
the other player.  So it was constantly trying to decide which was
more important, the reroll or denying it to your opponent.

That is part of the aspect of the doubling cube.  The other element
has to do with raising the stakes in order to get your opponent drop
out.  If the initiative chit ended causing the points for a game in
the multiple point match to increase, then that would be similar.
