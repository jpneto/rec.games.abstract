</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
METAGAMER is a program that plays SCL-METAGAME. The program takes as input
the {\em rules} of a specific game and analyses those rules to
construct for that game an efficient representation and an evaluation
function, both for use with a generic search engine.  The strategic
analysis performed by the program relates a set of general knowledge
sources to the details of the particular game.  Among other
properties, this analysis determines the relative value of the
different pieces in a given game.  Although METAGAMER does not learn

&gt;from experience, the values resulting from its analysis are
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
qualitatively similar to values used by experts on known games, and
are sufficient to produce competitive performance the first time the
program actually plays each game it is given.  This appears to be the
first program to have derived useful piece values directly from
analysis of the rules of different games.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Experiments show that the knowledge implemented in METAGAMER is
useful on games unknown to its programmer in advance of the
competition and make it seem likely that future programs which
incorporate learning and more sophisticated active-analysis techniques
will have a demonstrable competitive advantage on this new problem.
When playing the known games of chess and checkers against humans and
specialised programs, METAGAMER has derived from more general
principles some strategies which are familiar to players of those
games and which are hard-wired in many game-specific programs.

	It would be interesting to see how this program would function with
some chess variants taken at random from World Game Review #10 (which con-
tains 600+ variants). 
	How does the program determine the value of a piece when the values
of certain pieces can change radically in the course of a game?  I humbly 
suggest that the value of a piece can be a rather nebulous concept at times.
	In Unambiguous Chess, the rules state that a piece can only be moved
if its move can be written unambiguously with three alphanumeric characters.
Therefore, you can't move, say, N-B3 if there is more than one way of doing
this. This rule has the peculiar result of making a piece worth almost as
much (maybe more, sometimes) as two pieces of that kind would be worth. 
	Piece values cannot necessarily be added. When computing the value
of a pair of bishops, it definitely makes a difference whether or not they
are on opposite color squares.
