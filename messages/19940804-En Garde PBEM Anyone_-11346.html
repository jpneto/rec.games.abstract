Hello, fellow fans of swordplay--

I am contemplating running an "En Garde" campaign by e-mail. Remember "En 
Garde" by GDW?  It was never quite a full-on RPG, but it might be a very 
successful e-mail game.  It could easily contain dozens of players, and 
be played a a slower pace with not much harm done.

If you like "En Garde" and would like to get involved in this (admittedly 
ver experimental) game, please send me a letter and let me know:

	Your basic goal as a character
	
	About how many turns a month (or week) would be right for you

	Anything else.

This game would be human-moderated and highly improvisational.  I'm a 
busy guy so the maximum would be about one turn per week, but it would be 
designed so that if you missed the occasiional turn nothing terribly bad 
would happen.

Interested?  Let's talk! Just remember that I will be on vacation until 
the 22nd of august, so don't freak if you have to wait a short while for 
a reply.  I will NOT be logging in from Scotland.

En garde,

Paul
