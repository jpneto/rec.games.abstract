Dots and Boxes variant (Increment DAB)

In this variant the rules of classical DAB remain valid except for the scoring.
Blue start first and players alternate indefinitely until one of the player win.
Goal : To win a player has to reach k points in one of the cells.
k could be equal to 3,4,5 depending on how long players want to play.
The game ends as soon as one of the players reach the number k of points convened.
No draw is possible.

The game is played in rounds. 
A round ends when all the squares are coloured. Then players records their color with their scores. All the sticks are removed and new round will start.

Scoring :
If a cell is won on the round t by red and on the round t+1 by blue then the cell will have 0 as value.
If a cell is wond by red on the round t and on the round t+1 then we increment the score by recording 2 for the red. Same process for the blue.

Player take their turn alternatively even between the rounds. If red is the last one to play at the end of round t then blue start playing the next round and vice-versa.
Only the blue start at the beginning of the game.
The number of the rounds to be played in linked to the winning condition of the game.

This DAB variant could be played by more than 2 players in larger board (3,4,56.....).
The best way to play it is to digitalize it.
The computer will take the scoring in charge.
The way of playing will be of course very very very different either tacticaly or strategicaly.
