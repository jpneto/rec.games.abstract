Is there any evidence that the popularity existed outside Scarne's own mind?

Scarne was great at hype and self-promotion. Most of his own "inventions"
seem to have been variations on the same theme, and were highly derivitive
of earlier, better games by others, yet he hyped each one for originality
and superiority.

The copy of Teeko in my game collection is in pristine condition: the
original owner appears to have made the same conclusion I did, that it is
not worth bothering with. I don't recall ever having seen another copy. That
is not suggestive of much popularity. Popular games are seen over and over
again, usually showing evidence of play, often of heavy play.

I believe Scarne's popularity claims are major exagerations at the very
least, and are quite likely total fabrications.
