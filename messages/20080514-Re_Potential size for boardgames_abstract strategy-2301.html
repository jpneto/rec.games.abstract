I saw Inside Moves on sale, and thought it was a much smaller variant
of Chivalry (something slightly bigger than Cam, though), but I see I
was mistaken - instead, it was exactly the same as Camelot, which was
modified from Chivalry by being on a bigger board - but having only
four "knights" on each side instead of eight.

I didn't quite get this right.

Camelot was smaller than Chivalry, not just in the number of pieces,
but also in the size of the board; so I was right in thinking of
Inside Moves as smaller; my problem was simply that I was unaware of
the entire intervening existence of Camelot.
