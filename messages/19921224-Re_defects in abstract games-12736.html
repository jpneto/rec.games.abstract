a game without defects isnt necessarily good.  tic-tac-toe has no defects,

Hmm-- I would disagree, actually; tic-tac-toe does have defects.  The
most obvious is that the minimax strategy is trivial, all perfect
games end in a draw, and the 3x3 and 3-in-a-row board size is arbitrary.

ah...i think we have a problem in semantics...i agree that its trivial,
always should end in a draw and is arbitrary in size.  those are not what i
would term "defects" in the rules.  so i guess its how we use the term,
"defect".  in my application here, i was referring to the system of rules
and how internally consistent they are.  i've often said that rules to a
game is like trying to cover an open set with a finite number of closed
sets.  in this case, the fact that tic-tac-toe is trivial and completely
treed out has nothing to do with my "defects".  going back to Go, the
ko rule immensely augments the game, so its by far preferrable to not
having that rule (then lots of go-games are alas trivial).  the jump from
3x3 to 19x19 for Go-Moku gets rid of a lot of the triviality of tic-tac-toe,
and the double-3 rule is a small price to pay.

and looking up at what i said above, i said a "game without defects", so i
guess i wasnt describing what i was saying....:-)  i was trying to stay
within the system of rules.  so going back to my topology analogy, in
the case of tic-tac-toe, while the rules have a minimal finite number of
closed sets or perhaps a sort mutual orthogonality, the open set that they
cover is a trivial open set.  maybe its that orthogonality - the double-3
rule isnt "orthogonal" enough to the rest of the rules...:-)
