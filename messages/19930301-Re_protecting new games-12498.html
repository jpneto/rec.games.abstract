I don't think there is much problem with posting the rules to original
games here.  At worst, it constitutes publication, in which case a
copyright notice is advisable to prevent any claim of "innocent
infringement".  Under the Berne convention (which most of the
countries in the world have now signed) it is the act of creation that
gives an author the set of rights called copyright.  No notice is
required, but in many countries notice can help.  In some countries
(including the U.S) that's the word copyright or a 'c' in a circle,
the year, and the authors name.  In others it's the words: 'All Rights
Reserved.'
 
In the U.S., games cannot generally be patented.  However, mechanisms
which facilitate game play (such as an Abalone board) can be patented.
Trademark law in the U.S. applies to a name for almost anything that
is sold (including games), and company names which are not someone's
last name.  BTW I am not a lawyer and this not legal advice.
 
Is there a way to submit the rules of a game for inclusion in the
rec.games.abstract archive?
