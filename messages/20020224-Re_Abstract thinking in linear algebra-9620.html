You really want to know what I thought when they forced me
out of 1st grade into 2nd grade in mid-year.  I made it
perfectly loud and clear at the time that I thought it was
a REALLY stupid idea.  Especially doing it during Easter
break AFTER the 2nd grade class had already gone through
their Phonics.

So you had already reached the point where you no longer
considered the purposes of school as the place to learn.
This had already been knocked out of you.  As for phonics,
it belongs no later than the beginning of first grade; 
also, you probably did not need it.

The rest of your rant is in the same direction.  School can
be for academics, or it can be for socialization; it cannot
be for both.

BTW, I have seen a piece which argues that it is important
that children NOT be mainly with their age group for either
purpose.

The one who moves up like you did should expect at least
one more skip in the next two years; it continues.  Even
more, most children should not be in the same "grade" for
all subjects.

Some may want socialization; let them have it, but do not
force it on those who believe in real learning.
