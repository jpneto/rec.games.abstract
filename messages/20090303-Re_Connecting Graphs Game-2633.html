The graph looks messed up even when copied into a fixed font app.
Some of the segments don't connect vertices.  I get it and it is an
interesting concept, but your descriptions are direly in need of
diagrams as well as basic articulation.  I looked at your website and
found the following paragraph in one of your game descriptions.

"After the darker path of line-segments is complete, the players then
take turns filling in un-shaded-in sections of the grid, one section
per move. By 'section', I mean a polygon bounded by the darker line-
segments, or by vertexes where different parts of the path come
together, or by the perimeter of the grid."

A polygon bounded by vertices where different parts of the path come
together?  This is simply inarticulate.  Games and puzzles are two
different things.  The game description really shouldn't be a puzzle.

You need to show your game descriptions to someone you can count on
for constructive criticism before publishing them.  If your
proofreader says "Yeah that looks great.  I wouldn't change a thing,"
show it to someone else.
