Monkey Queen has a fabulous architecture, among my very best.  The
underlying mechanism is so subtle, MQ seems like an infinite game in opening
play.  Eventually, if nobody manages a checkmate, the walls start to close
in.  For example, you might be getting punched against the ropes near the
end of the game.  You want to slide a baby to block check, but you can't. 
You'd have to slide said baby away from the enemy queen, violating the
rules.

Subtle. Not like Breakthrough with opposing armies of unidirectional pawns
racing to opposite ends of the board.  Not subtle.  Nobody would ever
mistake Breakthrough, even fleetingly, for an infinite game.  This is what I
mean by architecture.  A subtle mechanism relentlessly driving MQ gameplay
forward.  Finitely.  Beautifully.

The preceding MQ example beautifully demonstrates the fundamental difference
between finite and infinite games.  Your opponent has duped you by situating
his checking baby where he knows you can't block it.  Finitude serves to
enrich the game here.  In a hypothetical infinite counterpart of MQ in which
babies could always move wherever they wanted, you'd be replacing the
breakdance of finitude with the death waltz of back and forth shuffling.

Christian Freeling: "If I had discovered the magnificent Monkey Queen
mechanism, I would have immediately demolished it, turning MQ into an
uninspired, dime-a-dozen, ko dependent game.  Call it intuition."

lol, There was never any danger of you discovering MQ, Christian,
because.....

Either way works.  My least concern is whether Monkey Queen meets some
arbitrary definition of "stacking game" created long ago by uber nitwit and
intermediate English speaker, Ralf Gering.  To me, a stacking game is one
such as MQ which is conveniently played with stacking pieces.  I have no
desire to debate with foreigners, or anyone else, on how to speak the
English language.  I think I've pretty much got English figured out.
