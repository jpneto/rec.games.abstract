The main difficulty that springs to mind is numbers.  On the Internet
it seems like there are a lot of us abstract gamers and there are a
lot of us.  But percentagewise we barely exist if game clubs are any
indication.  There are a number of such clubs in California.  I was
enthused about my new game (at the time) Cephalopod and, since it
hadn't been programmed for online play yet, I got the brilliant idea
of taking it to a game club.  At the first one I went to, admittedly a
small one, nobody wanted to play.  Instead we spent the evening
playing a Carcasonne-like game.  At one point when I brought up the
topic of Cephalopod, one lady said she liked every kind of game except
abstract games.  Judging from the blank stares and nodding heads she
seemed to be speaking for the group.  It was unanimous.  Later I found
a much larger club.  Every game being played had some sort of colorful
colorful theme such as vampires, coal miners, space monsters . . . you
get the idea.  I did actually manage to play Cephalopod a couple of
times, after suffering though the worlds longest game of Vampires at
Night (I forget the actual name).  I began to wonder what would happen
if the sun were to actually come up in real life.  Interest in
Cephalopod dropped off pretty quick.  The stacks of picture cards,
move cards, animated story lines, 14 page rule books written in fine
print that required a PhD to fully understand, etc. were all torture
for me.  I learned my lesson.  Percentagewise "second class citizens"
would be a high honor.  In reality it's more like "abstract who?".

I am putting feelers out. I was curious to see what the interest
would be to start an association to promote abstract strategy games,
that are done up in the likes of Zillions or Super Duper Games or
Boardspace?

Anyone here interested? Could get a discussion forum going, have
membership, and a championship at Origins or some other location.
Anyone here interested in this? Abstract strategy games are treated
as second-class citizens in the area of boardgames and I would like to
help combat that some, if possible.

I figure one thing that could be done is to have a world abstract
strategy champion who is the top player at two player abstract
strategy games in general. Also bring in the AI development community
also.

Comments?
