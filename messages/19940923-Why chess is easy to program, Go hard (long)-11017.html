1) The State of the Art

	Chess computers have already reached grandmaster strength, whereas
Go programs are still quite weak. It is usually felt that this proves chess is
primarily a fluid tactical game of calculation after all, whereas Go is a more
strategic and structural game requiring the elusive qualities of judgement,
intuition etc. that are too vague to be programmed. In fact, this
may well be so, but the explanation has no real value; there are games
that are more tactical than chess but not so easy to program effectively,
as will be seen.

	At the dawn of the AI era almost 40 years ago, chess was thought
to be a conceptual game in nature. There were claims that any program that
played well "could be said to have penetrated to the core of human intellectual
endeavor". The reasoning was that the branching factor was so large that
straight minimax search could be dismissed as hopeless a priori for any
imaginable computer speed. Hence there could be no alternative to an
elaborately organized system that knew patterns, evaluated positions
at a high level of abstraction, constructed plans based on those results,
and generally mimicked the complexities of human reasoning.

	High-IQ chess programs have not progressed far. Instead, the brute
force approach added small, clever tricks to brutality. Alpha-beta and hash
tables made the largest contributions. Various extension heuristics, and in
some cases, mild forward pruning techniques were incorporated, without
disturbing the "completeness" property of full-width search. Last but not
least, the speed of hardware has improved by many orders of magnitude.

	Interestingly, evaluation functions have not developed to a
commensurate degree. This is a significant observation.


2) What is Strategy?

	Beginners who play chess find frequent frustration. They know that
the queen is valuable, but when they sneak up to attack it, it moves away.
Wherever they look, the enemy is defended. The objective is to capture the
enemy King, but they see no means to advance toward the goal.

	In truth, long term strategy can only be based on features that are
invariant, or nearly so. Material is such a feature. When someone is up a pawn,
he tends to remain a pawn ahead, other things being equal. However, material
is a coarse quantity and begs the question of how one PLANS to win material.
Certainly, the location of the enemy queen is too ephemeral to be the basis
of strategy.

	The secret lies in a peculiarity of chess rules. Pawns capture
differently than they move, contrary to many chess variants. Therefore, as
enemy pawns approach other, they will frequently lock in chains, immobilizing
each other. This imparts a fixed, structural aspect to chess positions. Backward
and isolated pawns are bad because there is no way for them to change status
by ordinary means, only by heroic feats of accidental tactics. Because they
can't move, they constitute fixed targets, so it is valid strategy to "pile up"
on them. The configuration of White pawns on e4, f5, g4, and h2 versus Black
pawns on e5, f6. g5, and h6 favors White, ignoring other factors. That is
because both before and after White gets around to advancing his pawn to h4,
Black has no nonmagical way to improve his structure, h5 probably being
unplayable. After White plays h2-h4, Black suffers from an isolated pawn
on an open file if he captures. If he refuses, White has the OPTION of
holding or capturing himself, in his own good time. This itself constitutes
possessing the initiative. A valid strategy would be to mass rooks on the h file
before capturing, and/or place a Knight on h5. It is safe to refer to this
as strategy, because the same plan holds valid semipermanently,
whatever distractions are in progress elsewhere. Fixed pawn structures also
affect mobility of pieces, hence bishops can be "bad" on a permanent basis,
knights may have "outpost" squares begging for their occupation, etc.

	Occasionally, direct King hunts are an appropriate strategy, but
definitely not always.  In crowded middlegame positions, the general area
that the King calls home is constrained severely, because it is unsafe to
wander out in the open. In this way, the target can be considered fixed.
If the pawn structure is such that the attacker also has a permanent space
advantage on that side, it may be feasible to contemplate massing pieces for
a direct assault.

	It is not hard to construct positions that require theorem proving
to understand, and that will cause the typical strong chess program great
heartburn. Such positions now seem exceptional. It suffices to measure a number
of (somewhat) invariant and independent properties and just add them up. Some
even vaguer tactical measures of "activity" are often added to the mix.

	The details don't matter greatly, and no program attempts to be
comprehensive. What the programs do is sift through the great mass of
meaningless moves and select those that appear to collect the handful of
(semi)permanent goodies they happen to know about. It works.

3) Other Games

	The situation is clearer if we look at other unsolved games. The
table below is a subjective estimate, on a 1-4 scale, of how much effort was
put into other games, and how successful the results were in comparison to
human play. 

Game		Effort	Success
---------------------------------
Chess		4	3
Go		3	1
Othello		3	4
Checkers	2	4
Int'l Checkers	3	2
Kalah		1	4
Chinese Chess	2	1
Shogi		1	1	(from the land of consumer electronics!)


	The game of Othello is particularly illuminating. The object of the
game is to end up with the most disks of your color. However, an evaluation
function that simply counts disks performs poorly. The problem is that when
a disk flips to your color, that is no achievement, since it can easily flip
again.  However, a corner square once gained can never be lost. When that
happens, the squares two away begin to loom as permanent prizes also. The
invariants in Othello sometimes really are invariant in an absolute sense.
The evaluations are hence less subject to error, and the programs are very
strong indeed.

	In checkers, material advantage suggests victory more surely than in
chess. In actuality, strong programs consider a couple dozen other terms also.
For instance, control of the 14, 15, 18, and 19 squares is important and often
persistent. The greater reliability of the functions and their greater
coverage of what is important lead to greater success than in chess.

	In chess, the features covered during evaluation are less complete,
and less reliable, in that they can not infrequently be overturned by tactical
noise. What the success of computer chess has shown is that the loss is
manageable, that sound, greedy play on average compensates for occasional
misunderstandings of deep positions. Of course, the amount of careful
engineering effort expended over the years has been substantial.

	International Checkers presents a good contrast to the version
played in English-speaking countries. Material advantage is still important,
but not as insurmountable as in the 8x8 game. The powers of the King are so
vast that heavy sacrifices may be justified in order to get one early. This
is situation dependent, so humans need to exercise judgement. Also, it
may happen that 3 Kings vs 1 is a draw, so naive bean counting doesn't
capture the essence of the position. In consequence, successful programming
require devoting relatively more effort to the design of evaluation functions
than to deep search. Comments from the better informed would be welcome.

	Kalah is an extreme example of a purely tactical game. I suspect
that there ARE no long term mystical structural features that people can latch
on to. It is all calculation, and it is even unclear if one can improve on the
trivial evaluation function of counting the number of stones in each kalah.
Featureless games show the computer in a good light, but bore humans.

	In contrast, the last two games above prove that tactical games do not
imply easy programmability. In Chinese Chess, there are only 5 out of 9
files occupied by pawns. When they meet, one is annihilated, so the
positions are always "open" in the chess sense. The board is bigger
than western chess, but the pieces are weaker. The King position is more
fixed, though. My impression is that strategy consists of keeping track
of tempo counts to wheel pieces from one theater to another, one theater
always being the King's palace. A stronger player would have to comment.
In Shogi, pieces may be resurrected, so material advantage is less important
than in chess but more so than in Bughouse. I do not know what human strategy
consists of here either, although it is manifestly present. I am assuming
the two Oriental games are more tactical than western chess, yet less
programmable.

	All things considered, Go seems nearly as well suited as Othello for
tracking progress, at least in later stages of play. The score is merely
the sum of the situations on each front.

4) Tentative Conclusion

	There are games that are highly tactical and suitable for machines
only, yet there are other games that are tactical and played best by people.
Chess is quite strategic, though with a high tactical component, yet amenable
to computer play. Go is more strategic still, yet far more refractory
to mechanization.

	I think the tactics vs strategy dichotomy is simply an irrelevant
one, in determining programmability. A slightly better determinant is to
estimate how easily the human-relevant invariants can be formalized. It may
seem that Go is hard because there is no quick-and-dirty way to measure
"shape" or "thickness", but then, comparably murky notions in chess either
proved unnecessary, or had adequate crude substitutes.

	The distinctive feature of game programming for games other than Go,
is the encapsulation of evaluation knowledge in a simple function evaluated
at endpoints of the search. (There is some trivial knowledge in the search
too, such as "look at captures first", and "quiesce on captures". Adding much
more than this has proven even more difficult than finding ways to usefully
add knowledge to evaluation functions.) This separation of evaluation from
search is of course a very handy thing for developmental and theoretical
purposes. However, in Go, the security of a group and its territory may depend
on the outcome of a hypothetical ladder fight seen to end in victory for one
side.  If it so happens that the points crucial to the fight in other areas
intersect those in the implicit ladder, the status of the first group must be
reassessed. Here, local search is PART of evaluation. I believe THIS is the key
peculiarity of Go.

	In all likelihood, the search and evaluation processes in strong Go
programs must be more tightly coupled. This does not necessarily imply
construction of high IQ planning modules of the sort that failed in chess.
The singular extensions and null move heuristics in chess point to a better way.
These are "weak heuristics" that dynamically (i.e. during search) determine
importance or unimportance of candidate moves without the need for incorporating
deep domain knowledge. It was a mistake in computer chess history to regard 
forward pruning as an absolute. Some moves are profitably searched deeper,
and some are less worthy, but that is strictly a matter of degree. The
completeness of full width search is valuable, too valuable to give up.
Go programs will have to employ tricks like these, and more aggressively
than any chess programs have done to date.
