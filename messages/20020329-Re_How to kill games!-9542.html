Most reviewers of abstract strategy games (i.e. "Denkspiele", "Jeux de
Reflexion") don't know what they should look for when they "determine"
the quality of a game. The same is true for many people who invent games.

For a long time I try to define the minimum conditions which a game should
meet to be worth my time and efforts.

Since you speak of abstract strategy games, one of the minimal 
conditions for such a game would be the presence of strategy on
a level that makes the game worth playing repetitively. Obviously,
identification of strategy or even of high level strategy requires
playing strength of the reviewer or insight and testing of the
inventor. Quality might then be judged according to (perceived)
depth of strategy, period of unsolvedness, or realism of relation
between strategies and real world processes.

I find it useful as a Go player to consider levels of strategies
or of strategic analysis (e.g. simplifyingly rules objects, groups
of rules objects, warefare based on groups of rules objects) and as
a designer of a strategically advanced game to introduce terms
describing and distinguishing surface and levels of strategic
objects. See <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/crstrat.html">&lt;http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/crstrat.html&gt;</a>. Here is a
citation:

"
A <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>game topic<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is what you see on the playing material's surface
and find in the rules' terminology. [...] Tactics relies on playing
material and rules. Tactics so complex and advanced that it cannot
be completely calculated any longer is called strategy. 
Nevertheless, players want to plan their strategy. A thematic 
language eases such planning because thoughts are expressed handily
in terms of familiar topics. We call such analogies for handling
complexity <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>thematic strategy<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. A game with great complexity and 
consistent design has the possibility of creating developments so
dominant that no strategy should ignore them. Such a development 
shall be called <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>strategic topic<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. [...] In other words, most 
strategy should be subordinated to the strategic topics. [...]
"

For examples have a look at the webpage. If we take Go as an
example, then, since it is an abstract game, its game topic is
rather abstract - something like "sharing intersections". An
example of thematic strategy might be "defend big strings".
Strategic topics are "warfare", "trading", "harmonical balance", 
etc. Above that we could speak of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>psychology<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>playing styles<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, 
etc.

From the view of an inventor it is highly demanding to be sure
about having created a game with strategic topics. For a reviewer
it is close to impossible to detect strategic topics in a (possibly
abstract) game, unless he plays it dozens, hundreds, or even 
thousands of times. A primitive reviewer would just read the rules,
have a look at the game topic on the surface, play a few games, and
give a subjective comment with that he judges about "quality". In
reality he states only trivialities suitable for players that are
already happy with seeing them; e.g. those would be satisfied with
hearing that Go after playing it a few times still does not allow
an obvious winning strategy, which is like saying that I do not 
see the structure of the universe yet because I am in a deep but
- at least - beautiful forest.
