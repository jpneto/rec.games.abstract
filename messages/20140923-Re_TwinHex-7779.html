When I said a player has to flip the 2 previous tokens played by his opponent it is obvious that he can not remove them from the board by playing 5 against 5 or some foolish play.
So I see where you are heading to : finding loops.
I do not create games the same way others do.
My first goal is to come with something new (new protocol move, new kind of capture, new board and so on).
I give the basic rules and it is up to the users to add rules such as the game will be really fitting all the "tastes".
All the games I will publish in my book come with new idea each time.
My hope is that my games will create other games bsed on the same mechanics.

For now I`m so sick that I will stop sending another game this week. But be sure that I will post another game the next week.

Look carefully at TwinHex : it is very deep game. More complex than go.
The last phrase is meant to make you very angry.
