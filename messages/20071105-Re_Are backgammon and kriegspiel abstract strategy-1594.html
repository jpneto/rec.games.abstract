Just curious here.  The argument is that they are not, because
backgammon involves dice, and kriegspiel has imperfect information.
So, the question I would have is: are they or are they not?

As has already been suggested, it's a strategy game as it involves
thinking to win, and it's abstract because it doesn't portray anything
beside its own particular laws and realities.

I would say "could" rather than "should".

Can you please give your boundaries for what should or should not be
in an association to promote abstract strategy games?  Would poker,
bridge or other cardgames count?  Should a key be there is a strategic
linking of pieces in games of the association that have an impact and
an overall strategy?  This would knock out cardgames.

I think it may be better to stop getting hung up on definitions and
involve a little more pragmatism.  I wouldn't include Bridge, though I
think it is abstract and strategic, for the simple reason that there is
no shortage of outlets for Bridge players and creating another will
probably not make many waves amongst Bridge players or attract a
particularly great standard of Bridge players to IAGO.  Card games in
general are well established so whether or not they're abstract or
strategic I think it's the case that they don't need anyone to worry
about them.  So why worry about them?

I would be inclined to work things at two levels: those games which you
<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>potentially<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> cover, and those which you do.  The former group is the
one where your definition handles it, and should probably be wide
(strategy significantly involved in winning, nothing tangible
represented, as ballpark boundaries).  The latter group would be
determined by the membership.  Perhaps the Association covers a game
where some quorum of members call a vote for inclusion and some barrier
of voting is passed to include it.

This sort of setup gets one around spending all of one's time arguing
the toss about a perfect definition of an AGS, and also gets you to the
pragmatic point of an association: to serve its members in some way.  If
I produce something which can't be argued is <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> an AGS, but nobody
other than me wants to actually <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> the sucker, I really can't see
it's in anyone else's interest to spend time and energy promoting it.
By all means have an area for "potential candidates" at an event, but
save your energy for stuff where people really want to play the game(s)
<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>and against other members<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>.  It's entirely possible you'd have a pile
of serious Bridge players, but that they'd go to separate Bridge
tournaments organised by their usual clubs and associations when they
wanted to play Bridge against serious opposition.

Pete.
