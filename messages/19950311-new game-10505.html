I would like to introduce all of you to a new game called Renju. This is a
traditional Japanese board game, that requires a lot of thinking and
strategy. It has extremely simple rules,but very deep theory and openings
theory much like chess. If you would like more information, please contact
me.

There is the Renju International Federation, the Governing Body in the
World, also different tournaments being held and the World Championship is
held every two years. I am the Connection Man for the RIF in the USA.
Right now I am conduction the First North American Open Championship by
E-Mail. We are trying to set up the North American Renju Federation and
bring the next World Championship to the USA. So, please contact me if you
have more quiestions. My name is Alex Lipsits
