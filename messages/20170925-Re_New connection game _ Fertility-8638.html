This kind of crappy games are like a comets : during half second it light up the sky and in 1/000000000000000 second it disappear for ever.

So I call them "cometic" games (alluding to cosmetic games).

I went to read the rules of Mind Ninja and I was not surprised how someone rewarded by a contest known for it unreliability could be so dumb to think that generalizing is in itself a huge discovery.
Building pattern is inherent to any game. Pattern is not limited to geometric shapes.
But Nick is too dumb to understand that.
Designing a game is putting your finger is the ass of the game ( I mean the core of the game). Is the core of the game something new or not? Is the game exciting of not? Is the game opening the range of the game play or not?
