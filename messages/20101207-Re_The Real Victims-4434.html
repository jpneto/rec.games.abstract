No, you don't - not here anyway, which is all I was saying in the first

misdirect the astute readership of rec.games.abstract:

You got a "new address for here" because your colleagues, and more than
likely your vice-chancellor, told you to!  Do you think the astute
readership of rec.games.abstract has forgotten your colleagues' emails from
a month ago?  I think a reminder is in order.  I'm not currently planning to
publish any as yet unpublished emails from your colleagues, Bill.  You've
achieved such a supreme state of buffoonery, I actually feel sorry for you
now.

1. Bill Taylor's colleague, Jan Evans-Freeman, at the University of
Canterbury in New Zealand, wrote via email on November 11, 2010:
================================================================
Dear Mark
Thank you for alerting me to [Bill Taylor's attempted shutdown of
rec.games.abstract]. I hope it is all a misunderstanding but I have
forwarded it to his head of department to follow up urgently.

Regards
Jan Evans-Freeman

2. Bill Taylor's colleague, Richard Brown, at the University of Canterbury
in New Zealand, wrote via email on November 11, 2010:

Hi Mark

I can assure you that whatever's going on in your newsgroup is the action of
Bill alone, not our department or university.

regards,

Richard Brown
================================================================

Jeez Bill. Doesn't sound like your colleagues are soliciting your
"sympathy".  Sounds more like they just want you to shut the fuck up.  It's
almost like they're frantically trying to disassociate themselves from you.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Bill, the rec.games.abstract readership can plainly see that your colleagues
are a lot more concerned about you embarrassing them than they are about my
"shrill crackpot emails".   You can't revise the group history from less
than a month ago, Bill.  Memories are too fresh.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Consideration for others is a concept unknown to Steere, of course.

I suppose you're a model of consideration, Bill, with the non-stop
vituperation and the attempted banning of Christian Freeling from
Recre.Bills.Gibberish before he'd even said two words there.  Real
considerate!

As for my colleagues, they have Steere's number now,

Oh great!  Bill Taylor is actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>threatening<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> me now on behalf of his
colleagues at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand!  The math
professor gang is hot on my trail!  Bill, I think your colleagues might be
about due for another "tip-off".  I really think they would want to know
that, according to you, they now have "[my] number".

Bill, your whole world revolves around sympathy.  Sympathy for me, sympathy
for you, sympathy for your colleagues.  How about shit-can the sympathy?

Bill, you're <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>still<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> not accepting responsibility for your actions here. 
Just the whole notion of someone "getting you into trouble" is totally
infantile!  This isn't Wikileaks, Bill.  All I did was call your colleagues'
attention to your already very public belligerence here in public, academic
forum, rec.games.abstract.

I don't know, Bill.  Here we have an actual university professor who tried
to shut down a public, academic forum.  It's appalling, Bill.  It's beyond
belief!  I think <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> are actually a strong candidate for the Low Stooping

Your colleagues' emails are already "published to the world" on the
University of Canterbury website!  How do you think I got them, you idiot??
Their emails are no more public now than they were when I found them.  Could
you possibly be more of a buffoon????
