I see a long way back along the thread that a proposal was put forth on 
'philosophical' basis. In fact it was the type of philosophic argument which 
is also termed 'metaphysical'. That means that no one owned the opinion put 
forth, thus it was argumentation.

The thesis states that chess is stuck - but does not say for whom.

Part from an individual becoming 'stuck' at a certain level its stuckness is 
not so evident at all, nevermind changing the nature of the game to fix what 
is, after all, common to almost all chess players - reaching a temporary or 
permanent plateau where further improvement is elusive.

In that sense what is stuck is often the will to be self-critical and 
examine weaknesses, and a concommitant lack of will to study deeper in order 
to become unstuck. I am not saying this lack of will is a bad thing, but 
other things in life also require will, time, commitment, and rewards from 
chess perhaps do not compete, neither 'should' they.

Some people become stuck because of rote learning, and need to recognise 
that 'cramming' material of others can only provide a limited amount of 
progression, and the amount retained cannot usefully be increased because it 
cannot be deployed during actual play.

The route to 'unstick' this plateau effect is to attend more to looking than 
to remembering. Visual factors are the greatest stimulus to memory - and 
deep chess memory is not any sequence of moves, but pattern recognitions. 
and the important thing that every chess player should know is that these 
perceived patterns are learned without conscious effort by the act of 
playing chess itself, or by employing the will to solve game-diagrams.

In terms of performance time - the pattern recognitions cannot be recognised 
if the frontal lobes are busy straining to remember what to do from material 
learned elsewhere.

This situation is true for almost all players of complex strategy games, and 
to be 'stuck' in this is only to understand that one must get stuck-into it 
more for clarity to appear.
