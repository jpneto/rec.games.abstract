You mean you don't look at the board and play out sequences in your

   Yes... I do, however, the computer is allowed an unlimited number of
perfect boards and I am not allowed that (since my memory and
visualization are not perfect).  Furthermore, computers can increase the
number of these boards by simply adding in more chips and I have no such
option.  I don't know how much more strength a human player would gain if
he/she was allowed to use additional boards to explore variations but I
would guess that it would be a considerable amount.  I don't dispute that
computers have better memories than humans (or at least the potential for
better memories) but games like chess, go and checkers don't interest me
if they are simple memorization/visualization contests.  I say give the
human an extra board and let him/her play out the variations they want (in
the time alloted of course).
