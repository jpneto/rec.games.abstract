I was wondering about the Pie Rule (which, I think, is to put 2 of

which color to play).

Not exactly.  Black places one stone and White decides if he now wants play
Black, claiming the first move as his own.

From the context of this group, it seems that putting 1 stone and
letting the other side pick is apparently Not As Good, in the goal of
eliminating the advantage of going First (or Second in some games).

The pie rule can be pretty effective in connection games like Hex, assuming
the board is big enough.

Also, I have seemed to gather that a 1-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2... move

Clearly.  Personally I'm not a fan of multi move turns unless it's part of a
capture sequence, or a Dots and Boxes type thing.

Agreed.  Hate it.

My question is:

Where would I find studies on this issue?

I doubt if any actual studies exist.  Combinatorial game theory deals
mainly, though not entirely, with combinatorial games - which are defined to
have one move per turn.

For example, imagine Go using 1-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-....

This I doubt.

While some problems may go "out the window", others, I'm quite confident,
will come "in the window".
