I guess I got a little "ambitious" with the whole torus game thing.
Of course Bill deserves credit, so I updated my rule sheet
accordingly.

Bill also deserves credit for simplifying Mobius, and at some point I
will probably add his simplified version to my rule sheet, crediting
him when I do so.

I had attempted to retire from game design and Internet play several
months ago but then Scott Nesin programmed all of my games for his
site, GamesByEmail, two months ago.  At that point I got inspired
again and pounded out a few new connection games.

About half of my games are now connection games since I had that
little design surge, and so I split the games on my website into Games
and Connection Games.

Now it's all growing tiresome again as it had been when I retired the
first time, so I'm going give retirement another shot.  I'm fresh out
of ideas anyway.  I've been working with the Klein bottle for the past
couple of weeks but I just don't like how it's turning out so I'm
abandoning that.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll get back into game design
again at some time in the (hopefully distant) future.  It's kind of an
addiction.
