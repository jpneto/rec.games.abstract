The following is from Yann David, who asked me to post this on hid behalf.

			GALE'S GAME


Gale was a mathematician of the 19th century who invented
and studied a number of funny games, amongst which the one
discussed in this message, that I will refer to as "Gale's Game".

Gale's Game is a pretty simple paper and pencil game that involves
2 players and an ordinary (rectangular, m*n squares) grid.

The players play in turns; the one who plays last has lost.
Playing consists in choosing a free square and then colouring
the squares which are above and/or right of the chosen square.
The coloured squares cannot be chosen again.
Quite abviously, the last move consists in choosing the lower
leftmost square.

Here are the moves of a (rather silly) game on a 3*2 grid:

     1   2   3
     --- --- ---
 A  |           |
    
 B  |___ ___ ___|

(original state)
    

Player1 plays B2:

     1   2   3
     --- --- ---
 A  |    *** ***|
    
 B  |___ *** ***|



Player2 plays A1:

     1   2   3
     --- --- ---
 A  |*** *** ***|
    
 B  |___ *** ***|



Player1 plays B1 (and loses...):

     1   2   3
     --- --- ---
 A  |*** *** ***|
    
 B  |*** *** ***|


I have been told that Gale had published a simple general winning 
strategy for this game, but was unable myself to find neither the
publication nor the strategy. Has someone any idea about either 
one of them?
