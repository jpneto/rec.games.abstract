Hello all,

Cameron has had difficulty connecting to this group, so I'm posting
this message on his behalf.  It's a fun program to use, and there are
some games that represent an interesting combination of ideas/themes.

Hi,

A while ago I asked for volunteers to do a survey on board game
design for my PhD project. The survey is now ready!

If you've already replied to my request please ignore this message,
otherwise please consider doing the survey - it's simple, quick, and
fun.

If you're interested in participating, please send answers to the
following questions to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:cameronb@optusnet.com.au">cameronb@optusnet.com.au</a> and I'll send you a
copy of the survey.

1. Are you at least 18 years of age?
    Yes / No

2. Are you male or female?
    Male / Female

3. Approximately how often do you play board games?
    Hourly / Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly / Never

4. Approximately how often do you play video or computer games?
    Hourly / Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly / Never

5. Approximately how many different board games are you familiar with?
    0-10 / 11-20 / 21-50 / 51-100 / 101-200 / 201+

6. Thinking of your favourite board game, how would you describe
yourself?
    Novice / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert

7. How would you describe yourself as a board game player in general?
    Novice / Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert

Please do the survey even if you're not a games expert; fresh
opinions are appreciated just as much as expert ones.

Regards,
Cameron Browne
