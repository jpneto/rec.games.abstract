The descriptions of Twixt posted so far have all been incomplete.
A move consists of 3 parts -
1. Place a peg in any free hole,
2. Remove any of your own bridges,
3. Place bridges between any two of your own pegs which are a knights
   move apart.
In parts 2 and 3 you may remove (add) any number of bridges.

I sure never new about that rule before. My old 3M version of the game sure
doesn't mention it. Seems like a good rule to me, although as Mr. Hoey points
out, draws are still possible. It would seem that both 3M and AH messed up.
Jonathan Ferro mentions AH's modification that allows you to remove pegs as
well as links at the beginning of your move. Now, removing your own pegs
would be silly. Your own pegs cannot block you, only your own links can do
that. I think the order of play as stated above should be accepted as the
standard rules, especially since this is apparently the way the original
author wrote them! Hey Neil, looks like I was wrong.

If I understand this rule correctly, there is now NO reason to refuse to
link to a peg just played, since you can always remove the link later. This
could make game notation a little simpler; just assume any link that can be
made to the peg just placed is made. Also the ONLY reason for removing some
link k is in order to immediately make another link that would have crossed k.
(Unless you're trying to psych your opponent or something I suppose.)

Twixt was invented by Alex Randolph, a prolific inventor of games
(see Sid Sackson's "Gamut of Games"), who introduced it to a group
of artist freinds who used to frequent a Vienese cafe. It has been
produced by several manufacturers, all of whom are required to credit
the inventor (what a good practice).

Jonathan Ferro mentions AH did not give credit. Neither did 3M; they just up
and claimed the copyright.
