Here's a snippet from our last game chat:

=======
[15:18:46]Liberte&gt; I noticed your game M-Torus appears to actually on
the real projective plane

[15:18:58]Liberte&gt; actually be played*

[15:19:29]Liberte&gt; maybe I'm mistaken but it confused me because it's
not really a torus

[15:22:08]MarkSteere&gt; So, what's all the excitement about M-Torus from
5 years ago.

[15:22:24]MarkSteere&gt; I took that off my website because it was too
similar to a Bill Taylor game?

[15:22:44]Liberte&gt; yeah Projex, I know

[15:23:02]Liberte&gt; but it's not a trous is all

[15:23:05]Liberte&gt; torus*

[15:23:22]MarkSteere&gt; So? I never said it was. Who gives a shit?

I don't like wiseasses.  This is like round five of your wise-again-
ass-again campaign and I'm tired of your shit.

I think Ralf Gerring is probably easier to get along with.

Yes, Ralf, for all of his faults, is much easier to get along with
than me. He moderates a bunch of discussion groups you could join and
be really happy there.
