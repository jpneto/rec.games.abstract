Hello Chris,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There are a couple of my Draughts variants found on the Zillions site that
didn't get mentioned:  Tourney and Faustus.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Tourney:
According to my classification system of abstract games (mostly goal
oriented) Tourney isn't a Draughts variant, but a "Grundreihenspiel". I.e.
the player who is the first to reach his opponent's home rank or his own
wins.
(In my opinion, everybody may use his (or her) own classification system.)


Faustus:
I didn't know the game. It's a draughts variant according to my
definition.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Also, Armada began as a Draughts variant.  Whether it can still be seen
as one
after all the concepts I threw into is open to interpretation.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


Armada:
As the goal of the game is to control the enemy's dock (one peculiar
square), I don't call it a Draughts variant, but a "Felderspiel" (i.e.
"squares game").

23.
Polarity
--&gt; variant of Damas Espanolas by Chris Hunton; first player has a very
   strong advantage
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Interesting.  The strong first player advantage didn't come out during play
testing.  I'd like to hear more.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Strange. I'm a rather stronger Draughts player and usually win
against average players. When I did the play testing it was my impression.
I think the strongest strategy is to force your opponent to capture all
your negative pieces.

My definition of Draughts variants includes:

1.
All pieces can theoretically be part of winning or losing the game (i.e.
fulfilling the winning or losing condition). A game is won or lost if all
pieces of one or several types were captured by the opponent. In contrast
to Chess variants all pieces are potentially part of the winning
condition, not just some of them.

2.
Secondary Goal: Some Draughts variants also allow to win by blockading
                your opponent, but only as a second possibilty.

3.
Pieces promote when they reach the opposite end of the board (in Gorgon: by
returning to the own side).


Ralf
