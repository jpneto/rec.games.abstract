  Okay folks, I suppose it would be appropriate to define the rules of TwixT
before going any further .This is a 2-player game, or a 2-team game involving
4 players.
The board is a 24x24 square grid of holes. The holes
along the edges are referred to as border rows. The first player, red, attempts
to build an uninterrupted chain of linked pegs going from his/her "top" border
row to his/her "bottom" border row. The second player, black, tries to connect
the "left" and "right" border rows the same way. Since a link between pegs
is an uncrossable barrier to either side. It is impossible for both sides to
have a completed bridge. At the start, the board is empty of pegs. A move
consists of two parts:
1. Place one of your color pegs in any empty hole except along your opponent's
   border rows. (No one may play in the corners- the pegs don't fit!)
2. If it is possible to link two or more of your pegs on the board together,
   you may do so. Usually, you would want to, except in tight situations
   where you don't want to block yourself from making some future link. You
   could, for example, refrain from linking a peg just played, and then
   on some later move make the link (assuming the link has not been blocked),
   even though the peg you place is far removed from this link. A link may
   be played if the your two pegs are at opposite corners of a 2x3 rectangle
   (like a knight's move in chess) and there is no other link blocking your
   way.
For the 4-player variant, partners sit opposite each other around the board.
Moves proceed clockwise with no consultation. Only once during the game for
each team, a player may call out "privelege" which means the next player loses
his/her move, and play continues with the partner, meaning that team may
make two concecutive moves. Generally, being the first team to call privelege
is a disadvantage, so this feature is usually saved for the end of the game.

 Draws can occur when one player has an impenetrable barrier to the other,
but this barrier is not an uninterrupted chain of linked pegs. For example:

                H I J K L M
            10  * . . . . .
            11  .\@ . @ . @      *-RED  @-BLACK
            12  . * . @\./.        Note: only a portion of the board is shown.
            13  . .\* . @ .        Red's chain H10-I12-J14 is connected to the
            14  . . *\. . .        top, and J13-K15-J17 is connected to the
            15  . @ . * . .        bottom. Black's pegs prevent red from
            16  ./@ ./. . .        connecting these two chains.
            17  @ . * . . .

 I hope this explains how draws occur. This may not be as deep a game as chess,
go, or shogi, but there are some potent subtleties all the same. If anyone
would like to play an informal e-mail game please drop me a line. &gt;:)
