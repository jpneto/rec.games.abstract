In his other group, Clark posts "I agree that we need as many members
as we can get. There are still
some hold-outs. Michael Howe for instance has a personal grudge
against me for calling him Steere's hand-puppet."  Personal grudge,
no; I simply don't have any confidence that given this kind of
behavior, he has anywhere near the maturity to "moderate" a forum.
Since then, by the way, he has done worse.  He also announces his
intent to continue to spam this group.  I doubt that all those who
have joined that group know about Clark's personality problems, as
exhibited here, at BGG, and at IGCC.  Maybe his ISP would be
interested in his history of spamming and harassment and his announced
intent to continue to do?  If Corey wants my participation in his
other group, he needs to start by apologizing for all of his insulting
posts and his spamming of this group, and to desist.

You're not getting an apology buddy. I don't care if you join that
group or not. I couldn't care less about anyone who would defend the
sort of actions Steere took against Bill Taylor, as ridiculous as they
were. I think my internet service provider is the only party you could
involve in this petty bickering that could possibly have any less
interest in what goes on here than the staff at the University of
Canterbury. Jesus Howe you sound like that mustachioed trailer trash
that threatened to call the "cyber police" on everyone. :D

Okay.  I hope everyone over there knows just who they're dealing with,
God help them.

lol they're dealing with someone who isn't going to put up with the
sort of verbal abuse found on this site, even the verbal abuse he
himself posts. Besides which, I think a toddler could moderate this
thing. Somebody sends me a request to be invited, I click a button to
put them in the member list or else I invite someone onto the site who
seems interested in abstract games. What else did I do? Well I changed
the font settings to "fixed font", I made the group publicly viewable
(which is turning out to have been a mistake). Yep way too much
responsibility for one child to bear... :P
The only instance in which I will ban a member is if they are
blatantly insulting and I doubt I'll have to worry about that because
there is no one possessing Steere's mentality in the current member
list.
