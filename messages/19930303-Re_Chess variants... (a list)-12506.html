Okay - people have been talking about chess varients, so here are the
ones I know about and play frequently:

Monster: White sets up normaly, black sets up only his king and the four
center pawns (all one space ahead of normal).  Black can move twice for
each white move and blacks pawns cannot advance.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Two questions: can black's pawns capture?  Can black use his two moves
to move trough check on the first?

Let's see.  If no, no, then this is a pretty simple win for white, and
the only varisble is # of moves.  If yes/no, black still seems dead.  If
no/yes or yes/yes, then black has considerable stall power, but no chance
of winning, and can still only get the stalemate by white error.

Bug House: This varient requires two chess sets, and four players.  It starts
as if two games of chess were going to be played, but when a piece is captured,
you hand it to your teammate (so black on one board has to team with white
on the other)  On their move, they have the option of placing it on any open
space on the board.  If you play with clocks, they should typically be set
for about 3 min.  If not, moves should try to be made in under 5 sec, and
pieces cannot be placed on the board the same turn your partner gives them
to you.

We played a variant of this, without the speed.  Why so fast?

Here's a quick variant.  "March of the pawns" (by Mel Nicholson, 1986)

Each player sets up the eight pawns and king in normal positions, and
then proceeds according to the normal rules of chess (no castling, of
course, but en passant DEFINATLY applies).
