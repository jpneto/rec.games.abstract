There have been some majorly historic ko fights over the history of Go
(Wei-chi in China) of course, and the agonizing of many, if not all,
of the world's best champions have gone through to understand "living
in ko" life &amp; death problems will never be erased from their
memories.  They all later slap each other on the backs and talk of how
painful the particular instance of their ko fight was.  In my view, of
course, it is a sloppy rule to repair perhaps one of the two readily
known defects in the game (the other being the komi fix for the 1st
player advantage).
