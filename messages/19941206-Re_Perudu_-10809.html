I'm not at my library right now, but I do remember Perudo from a recent 
collection of games (The Games Treasury, author's name escapes me). It 
is, indeed, a dice game, similar to but significantly different from, 
Liar's Dice. It is of South American (Argentinian?) origin.

Perudo (also called "dudo" "Liar's Dice" and several other names) was a
Spanish adaptation from circa 15th century South America (mostly Paraguay)'s
game of unknown origins.  The game has even more variants than it does names,
but generally they involve increasing bids about the contents of several
dice (usualy not just the player's own dice, but all the dice).  In the
most popular mechanisms, this concludes with one player being forced to
hand over some amount of money to some or all of the other players, though
in many "parlour" variants, this involves the scoring of points or the
forfeiture of dice (in this last variant, my favorate, the winner is the
last person with dice remaining)  Included below is a description of the
variant I play.

The names "Liar's Dice" and "Perudo" have recently been trademarked and
attached to particular products which are sold commercially, but given the
long history during which the names were part of the Public Domain, I doubt
that these Trademarks will hold up in court.  It is similar to the motivation
which Milton Bradley had for using the name "Othello" instead of the public
domain name "Reversi" when it marketed that existed public domain game.
Claiming exclusive rights to "Perudo" now is like trying to claim ownership
and/or creation of the game "Hearts" or "Crazy 8's" or "Chess" where the
following predates the company trying to take credit.

GameRules Log: n-tuple bid-bluff dice game
Local Name: Lair's Dice
Location: Bay Area, California (Berkeley Campus)
Date found: August 22, 1987

1) Each player starts with five dice
2) At the start of the game, randomly decide on a first bidder for the first
round (usually the winner of the previous game, except the first game)
3) To start each round, everyone roll there dice and keep the result secret
from the other players (hide them with your hands or something and watch for
peering eyes when you look at them yourself)
4) Starting with the first bidder, a player bids a quantity and a pip count
(Example: there are five three's).  Each player in turn, can either raise the
bid or challenge it.  To raise the bid, pick a higher pip count at the same
quantity, or any pipcount at a higher quantity.
5) When a bid is challenged, everyone reveals their dice.  If the total number
of dice which show the bid pip count plus "wild" dice is at least equal to the
quantity bid, then the challenge fails and the challenger loses a die (remove
it from the game).  Otherwise the bid fails, and the bidder loses a die.  The
person who lost a die is first bidder for the next round.(Go to step 3)

Wild Dice: Dice which show a pip count of one are wild at the beginning of
each round, and remain wild until someone bids a pip count of one, at which
time they cease to be wild until the next round.

Object: Last person with dice remaining wins.

Variant: If no player has more than one die remaining, someone should call
out "pips".  For the remainder of the game, bid on the total pip count of
dice instead of the normal bidding.  Wild dice have no effect on a pip round.
