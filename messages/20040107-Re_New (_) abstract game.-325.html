<br><blockquote type=cite>Joao Neto and myself have discovered a new abstract board game, which seems
<br>so natural that I'm sure it must have been discovered before.
<br>
<br>We initially played it on a hexagonal board, but it seems just as adaptable
<br>to rectangular, which we are trying now.
<br>
<br>The original is like so:-
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously the size is variable, to taste.
<br>&nbsp; . . . . . 
&nbsp;. . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one "live" piece, the x, starting in the centre 
. . . x . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; as shown.
<br>&nbsp;. . . . . .
<br>&nbsp; . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The players move it around, moving alternately as usual.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .
<br>
<br>A move is any (positive) number of cells in any of the 6 directions,
<br>as long as they are all free.
<br>
<br>KEY POINT: every cell travelled over or landed on, cannot ever be landed on
<br>or travelled over again.&nbsp; So it is a bit like the racing in "Tron".
<br>One can imagine the "x" leaves a trail of impenetrable slime.
<br>(In fact the game is the well-known "Slimetrail", but with long moves legal.)
<br>
<br>Whoever first cannot move, loses.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; . . . . . 
&nbsp;. . . . . . 
. . . o o x .&nbsp; player 1 has moved 2 east.
<br>&nbsp;. . . . . .
<br>&nbsp; . . . . . 
&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . x .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; . . . o . 
&nbsp;. . . . o . 
. . . o o o .&nbsp; player 2 moved 3 northwest.
<br>&nbsp;. . . . . .
<br>&nbsp; . . . . .

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . o .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; . . o o . 
&nbsp;. . o . o .

<br>&nbsp;. x . . . .
<br>&nbsp; . . . . . 
&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . o .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; . . o o . 
&nbsp;. . o . o . 
. . o o o o .&nbsp; player 2 moved 1 southeast.
<br>&nbsp;. o . . . .
<br>&nbsp; . x . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that player 1 can move only 1 step northeast from here,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not 3 or 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or of course, 1 West or SW or SE, or 1/2/3 East.
<br>
<br>Because first-stymied is the loser, this is clearly a "standard" type of
<br>Nimmish game, a la "Winning Ways", though I don't recall ever seeing it
<br>noted there.&nbsp; Theoretically, the first mover (probably, for most sizes)
<br>has a sure win, but it would take Deep Yellow to work out what it was.
<br>
<br>When the remaining reachable areas become small or thin, ordinary CGT
<br>analysis would apply.
<br>
<br>.......
<br>
<br>So anyway, has anyone ever heard of such a game?&nbsp; And whether or not you have,
<br>give it a whirl - it's a lot of fun!&nbsp; And maybe an eventual member of
<br>Richard's play-by-email server?

<br>the only difference being in yours, the intervening spaces are flagged.&nbsp; and in 
survival, you can jump spaces... just so long as you have a place to 'land'
