Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Is there any evidence that the popularity existed outside Scarne's own mind?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Didn't you see the picture showing all these movie stars playing Teeko
simultaneously against Scarne? If you don't know the names, try to find
them in filmographies. They were all celebrities. It's ridicilous to state
that the popularity of his game only existed in his mind. His book was
obviously sold many times, it's still widely available in the US.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Scarne was great at hype and self-promotion.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I dislike his exaggerated claims too (such as Teeko is superior to Go,
Chess and Draughts). But Scarne also was one of the greatest card and dice
magicians of his time. It doesn't astonish me after the success he had as
a magician that he became arrogant.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Most of his own "inventions"
seem to have been variations on the same theme, and were highly derivitive
of earlier, better games by others, yet he hyped each one for originality
and superiority.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Which earlier, better four-in-a-row game was Teeko "derivitive"?
