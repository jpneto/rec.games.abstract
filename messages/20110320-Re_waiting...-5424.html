So, and just for clarity, how would the list system work exactly?  Like, a
judge's first choice is given 10 points, second choice is given 9 points,
etc?  Maybe it doesn't matter too much, but I'd rather iron out the details
ahead of time to hopefully preempt the inevitable complaint tsunami from
Christian.

I've emailed that statistic's professor friend of mine so I'll keep
you updated when I get her input.
What you mentioned about 10, 9 points etc was my initial thought and I
was thinking that everyone should make a list from 1-8 of the games in
their favorite order. After a pretty long discussion just now this was
a problem

If you like 3 games and think all of the other ones suck equally then
you're giving points pretty arbitrarily to the other games.  From a
voters perspective it might make more sense to order the games that
you like and then just not list the other games.  This means that if
they don't like any games they can say "all of these suck. I'm not
voting for any."

....anyhow I'm not drawing any conclusions on our voting process yet.
I'm curious what the Prof Dee says and I'll be discussing it with
various people before the jury ends up voting.  This may be another
reason to extend the date of judgment to after Ireland (I'll be there
for a bit over a week btw).  Something funny I also realized is that
I've played the games more than most of the potential judges put
together.  I know for myself at least which one(s) I will continue to
play after the contest :).
