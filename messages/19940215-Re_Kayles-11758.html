It sounds like the first player could always win by dividing the line into
2 identical regions on the first move. If n is odd, remove the middle token.
If n is even, remove the 2 middle tokens. Now any move the 2nd player makes
is answered by the corresponding move in the other region. The 1st player
must always win with this procedure, n'est-ce pas?

This is certainly true, that it is always a win for the first player.
In some sense all "interesting" impartial games are first-player wins,
because impartial games which are second-player wins are equal to zero.

Nevertheless if you want to know everything there is to know about such
games (i.e., which moves, if any, will win from any given position), you
need to know more than that.  You need to know not just that the game is
a first-player win but what it's value is in the mathematical theory of
such games.  In the notation of Winning Ways, we can compute the values
of some positions.  If we let X represent a token, then:

        X = *
        XX = *2
        XXX = *3
        XXXX = *
        XXXXX = *4

and so on.  Using this we can compute the value of various possible
intermediate positions.  If we let . represent a gap between tokens,
then:

        X.X = 0
        X.XX = *3
        X.XXX = *2
        XX.XX = 0
        X.XXXX = 0
        X.X.XX = *2
        XX.XXX = *

and so on.  Once the theory is in hand, the values can be computed as
fast as you can write down the positions.  The positions with value 0
are wins for the second player, and the positions with value *n are wins
for the first player.

All this and much, much more can be found in <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.

P.S. I believe the mathematical game of Kayles is based on an actual
bowling game in which a ball is bowled at a line of pins, and is large
enough to knock down one or two pins but no more.  The first player to
fail to hit a pin (possibly because none are left) loses.  Of course, in
that game bowling skill as well as mathematical theory would play a
role.
