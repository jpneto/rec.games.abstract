I am a casual player of Chess, Xiangqi, and Korean Chess, which uses the same
board and pieces as Xiangqi but the movements of each pieces differ from that 
of Xiangqi pieces. What I am interested in finding out is: Are there any other
game invented where the same strategical and tactical principles such as fork
skewer etc (which form basically exciting combinations) are applied? I used to
try to invent or combine the rules of Chess, Xiangqi etc to form new kind of
chess games but to little success. I heard about a game called MetaChess but
is that what I am looking for?
