Graham, this balancing rule of yours doesn't work, no matter
which number (odd or even, greater than 1) of moves are made
before the choice of colors. The point is that, if the turn
alternation starts before that, the choosing player will always try
to make the position as unbalanced as possible in order to
maximize his advantage, rather than the opposite.

I propose the rga Intelligent Man award, and nominate Luis.  He keeps

You can use the same protocol as in Loose: the first player
sets the komi, then the second player chooses sides.  As Bill
Spight explained in L19, half-integer komi is also possible by
giving Black a "conditional pass", which he can only use if he
passes first. This refinement effectively doubles the precision
of the pass komi.

(This conditional pass idea will ring a bell with someone...)

Ding, ding, ding!  It's alarmingly Sygo like, but I love it !!  Thanks Luis
and Bill (Spight, the new, intellectual Bill).  Bill may be a contender for
Intelligent Man as well, even though he works behind the scenes.

How does Christian Freeling, the most sophisticated balancer in the known
universe, remain silent throughout these proceedings??

I agree, this does seem like a nice and neat solution.

By the way, on KGS (the biggest English speaking real time Go server), Dusk Eagle and myself are 2d, illluck is 3d, and Bill is 5d and someone that has done a lot of theoretical study on the game, so you've managed to land yourself some reasonable players analysing this thing :D
