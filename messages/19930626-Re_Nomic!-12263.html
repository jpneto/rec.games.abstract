MR&gt;No.  I've been thinking of coming up with a modified version which could be
MR&gt;played via e-mail, though.  (Some of the basic rules could - and probably

MR&gt;effect, just to keep the game moving.)

Unfortunately, the Nomic MUD just recently went down (is that the correct
term?  closed?) and will not be restarted.  There is a Nomic mailing
list, and we're trying to use that to play Nomic.  I've developed
a rough draft of rules for e-mail play, cannibalizing from three or
four other Initial Sets I've seen.  The main differences between this
and other forms of Nomic you may have played before are 1) There are no
turns; players may make proposals at any time.  This is followed by
a one week period in which votes may be cast.  (This is how it was done
on the MUD as well); and 2) there is now the position of a Speaker, who
tallies votes, assigns numbers to proposals, etc., etc.  On the MUD, this
was of course done by computer.  The position of Speaker rotates from game
to game.  As was done on the MUD, after the end of a game, the new game is
begun not with the Initial Set, but as the rules were at the end of the
last game.

town very shortly for a few weeks (at least).  So I won't be able to
