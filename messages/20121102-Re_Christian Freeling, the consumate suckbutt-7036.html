Not that programmers are the enemy.  Au contraire. They're essential.  I, as well as anyone, understand the dynamics involved.  You've created an awesome game and now you need someone to program it.  A certain amount of ass kissing is bound to transpire. I suppose I'm guilty of that too. 

It's just that, amid all the praise for the fabulous programmers, let's not lose site of where the games come from.  They aren't a "given".  Without modern designers, these fabulous programmers wouldn't have anything decent to program.  They'd have endless Chess and Checkers variants, and a whole slew of other shit games.  

At sites where all they have are variants and shit knockoffs, the programmer praise isn't quite as lavish.  Amid the compulsory, sheep flock ass kissing, there's a steady sub-chorus of complaints.  Like "Oh great.  Checkers variant number 17.  Tie me down."  Yeah, I know.  There are complaints no matter what.  Well guess what.  There are a lot more complaints at sites like GoldToken and BrainKing that specialize in variants and crapola knockoffs created by the resident programmer who knows shit squat about game design.

I know, I complain about Christian too much, comparing his head to a scrotum and so forth, and it's tiresome.  But, in spite of his virtues, there's been too much revolting, crotch oriented behavior.  Volumes of Christian endlessly licking his own nut sack in the Arimaa forum.  Leaping at every programmer's anus with pursed lips.  Come up for some air, Christian.
