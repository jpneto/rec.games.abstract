What are your criteria for something being a game, since Stackers

Let's say two extremely defensive great, great grandmothers sit down
to play your game.  They've learned from decades of driving that one
can never be too careful.  They slowly advance their armies and meet
head to head in the middle.  And that's as far as they ever get.
Neither player wants to be the first to jump on the other.  Since
neither player will agree to a draw, they commit to sitting there and
jostling their back checkers from side to side for the rest of their
lives, which mercifully won't be too much longer.  Now what?  Do you
berate the great, great grandmothers because they aren't "playing
right"?  To me that's not a game.  A game is something you play, not
something you endure.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can make the same criticism about Chess: Players can just move a
rook back and forth and never commit.  That doesn't make Chess a
non-game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A draw doesn't have to be forced by a losing player.  Players can
simply find themselves at some sort of impasse, caught in a loop of
moves, where the first one to break out of it loses.  No forcing or
player cooperation necessary.  This is almost certainly the case with
your game in my opinion.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't agree, but unless we get statistics for a number of games played
by players who want to win rather than prove a point, I can't see how we
can resolve this.

Again, the fact that you, someone with zero experience in the game,

In the same fashion, another person with zero experience in the game
claiming that it will inevitably lead to a draw can not have any more
weight than that.

 Experienced players could possibly figure out a way to fall into a

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Does "draw prone" mean that draws are likely or just that they are
possible?  In the first case, your statement is a tautology, in the
other case, it is unsubstantiated.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 If players can have a draw by cooperation then it's probably only a
matter of time before they have a draw without cooperation.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, quite unsubstantiated.  It is easy for two players playing
Checkers to cooperate forcing a stalemate, where neither player can
move, but this doens't happen in actual play.

So we have opposing beliefs.  Until we get more hefty arguments than

Many good games have possibilities of draws: Chess and Go are just a few
examples.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, do not compare your game to Chess or Go.  Chess and Go are two
inevitable, very fundamental games.  Whether you like draws or not,
Chess and Go had to come into existence sooner or later.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Chess is far from inevitable: It is a quirky game with lots of
special-case rules.  Go is a much "cleaner" game, and I could well
believe it being reinvented if it is forgotten.  I can't imagine Chess
being reinvented.  Chess-like games, sure, but not Chess.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Chess and Go
have the benefit of thousands of years of evolution.  They've been
shaped to perform very well for beginners and advanced players.  Chess
begins to crack under the pressure of extreme expertise, attained by
years of intense study.  Your game won't crack under years of intense
study.  Your game will crack the first time it's played - by overly
defensive beginners who are not cooperating, as I've already
demonstrated.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I hardly call your claims a demonstration.  That would require more
substance.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In fact, you can argue that the possibility of draws is an advantage for
deterministic games, as absense of draws implies that one player has an
advantage.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's ridiculous.  I'm so tired of these crank-theoretical, "perfect
play" arguments.  One player will have an advantage anyway, regardless
of the presence or absence of draws.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So you claim that there is no possible deterministic alternating-turns
game that is fair?  That is a strong claim, so you should back it up
with some proof or at least some argument that would make it plausible.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Chess has a huge first move
advantage.  Its potential for draws does nothing to mitigate that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I did say that possibility of draws do not guarantee fairness, just that
it is a requirement for fairness.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 It
only makes the game worse.  The potential for draws can't possibly be
considered an "advantage" of any sort, in real terms or in theoretical
terms.  There's going to be move order advantage no matter what.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why?  I can easily construct a deterministic full-information game where
it doesn't matter at all who starts.  It will have the possibility of
draws, though, as it is obviously not possible to achieve theoretical
fairness if draws are impossible.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 The degree of move order advantage depends skill level of course.  A
balance should be struck between game length and move order advantage,
by, for example, varying the board size of a scalable game, experts
getting a larger board.  Move order advantage should be maintained at
such a level that the initial coin toss is more of an annoyance than a
liability.  The coin toss will never be a total non-issue.  The
abstract game is in the end, a game of luck, no less so than Poker
with it's initial, random dealing of the cards.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't see how luck gets into the picture in a determinsitic
full-information game.  I agree that lack of perfect play makes some
games end otherwise than they would with perfect play, and that this
might make the outcome not be determined by who starts, but rather by
who plays better.  But this is not about who is more lucky, but about
who makes fewer mistakes.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 No game is perfect and no game should be perfect.  Games can only
function as games when driven by imperfect play.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed.  I don't argue here, but games can be badly skewed towards one
player even if both play imperfectly.  All games where draws are
impossible will be skewed to some degree, and all larger boards or more
pieces will accomplish is to reduce the skew.  It will never go away
entirely.  This might not be a problem in itself, as you can always
arrange for a series of games where players play both sides equally
often.  This will eliminate the skew, but at the same time introducing
the possibiliy of draws: The players may win the same number of games.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Arguments based on theoretical perfect play are stunningly irrelevant.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No more so than arguments that say that games where draws are impossible
are inherently superior to games where draws are possible.

Stackers was not primarily an attempt to increase the game tree.  I
admit that the idea for Stackers grew out of this discussion, but the
main purpose was to make an interesting and fairly original game, the
original part being the rule for moving parts of stacks that are capped
on both ends by the moving colour.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Originality means nothing in a bad game or a non-game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed not.  I have seen highly original games that are unplayable,
either because they are blatantly unfair or because they take for too
long to complete even if no player deliberately stalls the game.  But an
unoriginal game will not be very interesting either.

I happen to believe that Stackers will be interesting to play and not
have an obvious winning strategy, nor be very likely to drag out
forever.  You may not agree, but unless you can make strong arguments to
support your stance, it will just be a difference of opinion.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Please, and I don't want to discourage you as a designer, but there
are unlimited avenues of creativity available to you - avenues that
don't begin with my games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Stackers does not derive any more from Basic than Basic derives from
Checkers.  Don't deride other games from being derivative of yours when
most of your designs are derivative of pre-existing games.

Many good games are derivative, but make crucial (but sometimes simple)
changes that make the new games interesting in their own right.  So
there is nothing wrong with being derivative, as long as the derivative
gives sufficiently different play from the original to make it
worthwhile to play both.

For example, Blokus Trigon is clearly derivative of Blokus, but the
change to a triangular grid changes gameplay enough that it is
interesting to play both versions.
