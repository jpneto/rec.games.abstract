The issues faced by this is that people can't buy 10x10 boards
anywhere.  Until there is mass adoption, it is hard to get that.  The
Chess variant community would like it a lot.  We just aren't there
yet.

Would adding rules for a Camelot-like game that used all the squares of
the board solve the problem? There are particular problems with that
approach, even if there were no legal issues, given the history of the
game (its publisher was also bought by Hasbro, and imitating one of the
games they own because of Parker Brothers, even if the letter of the law
were followed, would be unfriendly since they were nice enough to let
the creator of a game made by one of the other companies they bought
regain his rights).

Including chess pieces and the rules for my Spectral Realm Chess, which
is freely available to all, wouldn't help as much; that might be
likelier to exacerbate the problem than alleviate it. And English Gothic
Double Checkers would also make things worse, not better.

If you look at what happened regarding the boardgame Stonehenge, you
have to have at least one game in there that a lot of people want to
own.  Beyond that, you then would need a lot of other content.  You
need something like those 10-1 sets, but then have a community produce
a lot of content for it.  Sheer quantity alone won't do it though.
Even a Camelot type game won't.  I believe there also needs to be a
consumer demanded shift.

One's best bet is a themed videogame that has a bunch of abstract
strategy games that is positioned line minigames, and that get on the
shelf at Gamestop.  The IAGO World Tour can help in this capacity.
