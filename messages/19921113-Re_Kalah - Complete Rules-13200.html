Another way I was told that the game could end, though this could be wrong,
is if one player gets more than half the stones in his scoring pit. At this
point the winner is already known, but maybe play continues in order to see
how close a score can be achieved. Please correct me if this is incorrect.

This, I think, depends on who you are playing with. In light of the fact
that the KALAKH program uses coins instead of stones, and keeps track of
how much money you lose, it looks like there are a few people out there
who play for money. In that case, you might want to keep playing just to
lessen your loss. If the stakes aren't as high, though, I don't see why
you couldn't stop the game then.

I do have one other rule question. If the last stone I place lands in an
empty pit on my side (a capture normally) and there are no stones in the
opposite pit, does my stone go into my scoring pit?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No. The only time the stone is removed is if it captures pieces on the
opposite side. Otherwise, it stays were it is.
