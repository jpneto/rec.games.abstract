One of the combs would be an odd number of cells larger than the other.

Yes, draws are impossible. :)

 I had just been trying to explain how that position inspired me to get rid of passing and MAKE the game drawless.

Sorry i'm so bad at communicating.

I was thinking about how the "ring" win-condition in Havannah would be super drawish on its own, ...

Beware.  Christian Freeling is always watching.  Right now he's struggling with an irresistible urge to leap to the defense of his precious Havannah, but hopefully he can restrain himself.

It's not like I was attacking Havannah in any way. And guys like Christian are fine with me. I guess I got used to lots of bragging during all the basketball I played as a kid? 

I also think Nestor seems pretty cool. (even if I don't really care for most of the games his site sells)

That's a better description with the middle of the board ring.  I actually like Loops more than Loops-F.  Loops has its own identity.  It doesn't matter if cooperating players can create a draw.  Square Oust can draw, for example, if players cooperate in forming a checkerboard pattern of stones.

Just to make sure... 

There are no draws. :) 

I had just been trying to explain why I took out passing to get RID of draws, and i think i accidentally mislead you there.
