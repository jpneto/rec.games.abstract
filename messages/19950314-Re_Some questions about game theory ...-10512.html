1. Please, help. I'm in trouble with iterative deepening. Do you know how

First, the "why" of iterative deepening:

    In alpha-beta, the size of the search tree (and thus the time
    required for the search) can be massively reduced if the best move
    is tried <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> at as many nodes as possible.

    Anything which consistently gets the best move tried first will
    yield a big payoff in the search.

    The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>assumption<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is that normally the best move from a position
    doesn't change when the search goes one ply deeper.  But a
    shallower search will run much faster, because the tree grows
    exponentially with depth.

    So it pays off to do a (d-1)-ply search at a node to determine the
    probable best move, before doing the full (d)-ply search to
    determine the real best move.

    In turn, this (d-1)-ply search can be sped up by doing a (d-2) ply
    search to determine the best moves.  And so on.

Note the paragraph marked <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>assumption<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  If you are programming a
pathological game or a very poor program, these assumptions may not be
true.

To do iterative deepening, we need some data structure that allows the
operations "Write(position, move)" and "move = Read(Position)" which
store a move with a position, and which returns the stored move (if
any) for a given position, respectively.

This is probably your real question---How do I write those two
functions?  Unfortunately, the answer depends on what game you are
programming.  And even for a fixed game, there is a wide variety of
choices in data structures.

One big decision to be made is whether you are going to store the
position exactly, or discard some of the information and risk an error
in reading.  Errors are evil, of course---but storing an entire chess
or Go position requires a lot of memory!

A popular choice is to use hashing.  For example, write a function that
takes a position and converts it to 64 bits (8 bytes); if this function
is well-chosen, the chance of accidently confusing two positions can be
as low as 1/(2^64).  For most game programs, this is an acceptable
error rate.

So the "what" of iterative deepening:

    for d = 1 up to depth-limit do
       alpha-beta-search to depth d
    end for

Inside your search routine,

   move = Read(Position)
   if move found then
	try move
   end if

   try remaining moves

   Write(Position, best move)

   return best move

Hope that helps.
