Extremely so.  Every game is size dependent to some extent, even very
scalable games such as Hex Oust.  If you've played a lot of base 7 Hex Oust
and then switch to a base 6 board, the gameplay is awful.  It's like a
jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing.  For any game there's going to be a board
that's too small.

Moving to a larger board is not usually going to present a problem though. 
Base 8 Hex Oust is not dramatically different from base 7 Hex Oust gameplay.
 Base 8 gameplay can be described as a little roomier, and richer - more fun
to play if you have like an hour and a half free.

With Monkey Queen, a larger board does present a problem.  Moving up to an
8x8 from a 6x6 changes the geometry of Monkey Queen's gameplay considerably.
 A queen's range is much larger on the larger board relative to a baby's
range, which is always one square, independent of board size.

8x8 MQ is also not "cluttered" enough.  It's too easy for the queen to zip
off into the distance, forcing enemy babies to trek after it.  6x6 MQ is a
little trickier.  You might have to shuffle some of your babies out of the
way before your queen can make its getaway.  And the queen's getaway won't
take it very far on the 6x6.  You'll be right back in the thick of it before
you know it.

It is odd though, Christian.  In my 18 years of designing, I've never
encountered the degree of size dependence that Monkey Queen presents.

What worried me was Gert's suggestion to 'fix' the problem.

Not that I thought for one moment that you'd consider this 'solution',

I've never accepted a suggestion for a rule change from anybody, except for
superficial stuff like starting positions.  Nothing that would change the
identity of the game.  Call it designer ego if you must.  ;D

Gert's suggestion of the two stone move merely highlighted the original
complaint.  It takes a lot of lonely, non-interactive play to march babies
across a too big board.  Solution: Don't use a too big board.

In this case the babies just needed a cradle of a size

Exactly.
