I finally tracked down the (Unknown) in the Shello/Redstone discussion.  

[Redstone rule sheet: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Redstone_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Redstone_rules.pdf</a>]

I won't embarrass that person by mentioning his name, though I should after he dogpiled me with that hypothetical Oust nonsense.  Suffice to say that (Unknown) has now recanted his testimony.

MS: You can't play an eye [in Redstone] unless it results in a capture, either enemy or self capture or both.

(Unknown):  Okay.  It would probably be an interesting exercise to see how it plays if you can play eyes without capturing, just as a variant.  It would totally fuck up the Go resemblance.

MS: That's how it was originally. There was a paragraph stating you could do that. That was Luis' contribution. Snip out that paragraph.

(Unknown):  Ok.  I didn't know what you meant by cancerous eyes.  

MS: Luis' point was that it would be more Go-like if I snipped out that paragraph.  Then he's going all "co-designer" on me. F that.

(Unknown): Actually that was my doing.

MS: Yeah, but [Luis] was into it tooth and nail after you brought it up.

(Unknown): But I misunderstood what his contribution was.  If that's all he added I would say yeah he has no legitimate claim to co-designership.  But please for the love of god do NOT publicize this comment.

That only leaves monumental hypocrite, Christian Freeling, who only grudgingly gives credit after someone has thoroughly restructured his game (e.g. Arty/Hanniball).

Major adopted tweak #1: Woops, the spirit seems to have eluded me  :D

Major adopted tweak #2: Darnit, that wily spirit eluded me again  :)

Major adopted tweak #3: Fuck!!  Stop dodging me, spirit!!

Major adopted tweak #4: Ok, ok, I guess so-and-so deserves a little credit here.
