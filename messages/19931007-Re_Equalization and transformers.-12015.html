|&gt; What is "hypercontrol"?

You have hypercontrol on a go board, if you have a pattern of stones of your
color on the board such that: if the opponent may have arbitrarily many (legal)
moves consecutively (while you pass), then at the end of it you can still
remove all his stones from the board, (with normal play).

e.g.  . X .    is hypercontrol       but   . X .    is not, as white could play
      . X .    of a 3x3 board;             X X .    4 moves round the edge then
      . X .                                . . .    capture you at the corner.

It is quite fun to seek the minimal-stones form of hypercontrol on an nxn board,
for n from 2 to 19 (say).

The connection with "progressive go" (i.e. multimove 1-2-3-4-...) is clear;
because once the move numbers become large, you must secure hypercontrol 
of (at least your part of) the board, otherwise your opponent will get in 
and smother you, as above.

It is vital that the consecutive moves all be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>legal<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, of course; they may not
leave a position with some stones having no liberties.  Otherwise the whole
thing would become meaningless. As it is, groups with two (very small!) eyes
are still unconditionally alive.

Progressive go is fun; I've played quite a bit on a 9x9 board.


Progressive chess is already quite popular, as I indicated in my first post.
The standard rule (to support David Kassover's reply to David Bush's query),
is that check may only be given on the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>last<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of your sequence of moves, and
one must remove the check on one's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> move of a sequence. Also, one may
not allow oneself in check midway through one's sequence of moves.  In other
words, every move must be "legal" in ordinary chess terms, (just as if the
opponent was "passing", go style, while you had your moves).

Interestingly; for those who, like me, believe the whole concept of "check"
in chess (and its miserable corollary, stalemate), is an unnecessary and
irritating historical accident, spoiling the "clean lines" of the game, (which
should just be played to the king is actually captured); the above remarks
provide a cause-damaging counterexample.

In progressive chess, playing till the king is merely captured, makes a totally
trivial game; but playing with the above "legal-checks-only" rule, makes a
fascinating and far from simple contest.
