A student here recently lent me a computer game (from a few years back)
entitled "Seventh Guest". The player moves from room to room in a
creepy house solving various puzzles. One of the puzzles is a game
which you play against an unseen opponent. I wonder if anyone has
done an analysis of this game?

This is the game of Attaxx (not sure of the spelling).

  The more common spelling (the one I saw first, and the one with
more Google hits) is Ataxx (only one T).  Does anyone know where
this name originally came from?

  I have a copy of a Win3.1 shareware Ataxx clone called "Dominate,"
which is very nicely executed.  Graphically, I mean -- but also
with regard to the AI.  With practice, I got to the point where I
could beat the computer opponent almost every time, which is very
satisfying. :)  Given a modern alpha-beta-based Ataxx AI, it would
trounce me right out of the gate every time, which wouldn't be
satisfying at all.

  Philosophical interlude: The big thing in complicated computer
game AIs these days (Warcraft et alia) is to make the AI "balanced"
against the average human opponent.  Has there been any similar
development in the simple abstract games field -- e.g., chess
or checkers AIs that can adapt their "brainpower" in an intelligent
way (i.e., not by simply reducing search depth, but by using a
different set of heuristics or perhaps committing well-hidden
"blunders" every so often)?
