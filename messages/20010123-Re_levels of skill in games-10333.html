 and lets throw in the dan levels of Go, which in the old days used to
 have 9 pro levels, 9 amatuer &amp; then the bottomless kyu levels.  so my
 old 13 kyu was 31 stones behind the world title.  doubt that Go is the
 game that answers your question, but it's a start.  do the chess ratings
 roundoff to the nearest 10?  there are fractional go ratings, for example
 on the igs, but they cut back from 2 decimals to 1 after concluding they
 couldnt tell the differences that closely.

 interesting question, number of levels.

 how many belts are there in Kung Fu?  (i know - even now there are
 prisoners in window-less rooms under enormous coercive pressure to
 come up with new colors for the belts every day, but...)

 let's say the igs.  you start at 30k, somewhere around 6d you start
 overlapping with the 9 pro ranks...so i get 44 roughly.  given that
 they then go to a tenth of a point, you have a total of 440 levels.

 if the top chess player's rank is 2940, is that 2,940 levels?  or,
 more practically, 294?


 i suppose you could argue that #levels = population of earth, if
 you wanted to be that way.
