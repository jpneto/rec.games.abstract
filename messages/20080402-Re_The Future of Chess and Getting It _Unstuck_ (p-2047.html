I will say, keep in mind that merely doubling everything doesn't make
a game better.  Position, balance, protecting pawns, structure, etc...
all count.

In addition, Sanny the spammer didn't even manage to double 
everything.  He has twice as many men and four times as many 
squares.  Anyone who has played with a variety of chess variants
knows that having a higher percentage of empty squares makes
bishops and queens more powerful while weakening knights, pawns,
and kings.  Being able to move 16 squares away also strengthens
bishops and queens against knights.

Chess is just fine the way it is.  It doesn't need fixing.
