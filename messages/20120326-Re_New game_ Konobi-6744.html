'a' is a legal move for Black. It's only weakly connected to c2, but all the available placements (b2 and d2) which would be strongly connected to it would also be weakly connected to some other stones.

'b' is an illegal move for Black. It's only weakly connected to a3, and it's still possible to make strong connections to it (on a2 and a4) without making weak connections to other stones.

I don't know Luis. The placement conditions may be sound, even 'architecturally sound', but I fear strategical clarity is blurred by the amount of visual dexterity that is required. Of course experience tends to overcome much of this in the long run, but it seems quite a hurdle to me in this particular game.

I may be wrong of course (thought I'd better mention it :)
