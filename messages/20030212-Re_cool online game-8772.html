<br>I am quite sure that not all posters/lurkers/readers agree with
<br>this. However, the rest of your commentary is right on.

<br>&nbsp;we have had many threads drift from this, willingly so.
<br>&nbsp;but the definition of abstract game has to adhere to this.
<br>&nbsp;remember, the definition of an abstract game is more of a
<br>&nbsp;mathematical definition than a dictionary definition.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;we dont have to be so stuffy we rule out discussion about
<br>&nbsp;other games, especially those with a lot of abstract game
<br>&nbsp;thinking in them.&nbsp; and i havent seen the group get too
<br>&nbsp;stringent about this issue.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;i suppose we always have the option.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;when the mahjong players were discouraged, that was okay.
<br>&nbsp;when the 3-D action RPG-ers were driven away, that was okay.
<br>&nbsp;sometimes we drift.&nbsp; the group has been good.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;i did feel a little netcop-like saying what i did.
<br>&nbsp;but it's true.
