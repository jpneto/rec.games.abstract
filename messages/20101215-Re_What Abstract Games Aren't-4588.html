Abstract games are not hidden information games or simultaneous move games.
They aren't Poker, they aren't Matching Pennies, and they aren't any sort of
mathematical recreation, matrix games involving two players simultaneously
choosing a row and a column respectively.

The term "abstract games" has a meaning.  Something other than games that
are abstract.  Every game is abstract.  Stones and a board with a grid drawn
on it most certainly do not preclude a game from being abstract.

If mathematical recreation games need to be discussed here, I actually don't
see any harm in that.  It's not like we can't spare the bandwidth.

I can't argue that math recreation is interrupting something more relevant
here, not with professor Billshit trying to shut down the group with spam
attacks and complaining about abstract games and their designers.  Not to
mention professor Bushit, a fake Chinese guy, who's really German
apparently, here to vouch for professor Billshit.

You seem to have such a high reputation of Christian Freeling's theories 
about who that person is that you seem to accept them without question. 
A pity, because you both are completely wrong. I know that person in 
real life, and he has neither pretended to be Chinese, nor is he German, 
though both of your easy acceptance of country stereotypes may well add 
xenophobia to both your undesirebale traits.

It's a crime that these two integrity challenged clowns have been placed in
positions of responsiblitly with the malleable young minds of students.

Integrity-challenged is very humorous, coming from someone who had no 
qualms about trying to get Bill fired from his job, just because you 
couldn't counter any of his arguments with rational ones of your own. 
You don't know the meaning of integrity, though your liberal use of bad 
language and insult indicates the paucity of your own reasoning. I 
wonder, even, whether you had any great hand in developing the games you 
claim to have developed, given the lack of reasoning ability you show in 
this forum.
