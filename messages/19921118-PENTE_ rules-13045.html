Since the rules for Pente haven't been posted yet, I'll include the rules
sent to me by Bill Shubert.  I have edited Bill's rules, and put them
on agora.scs.leeds.ac.uk, in /pub/rec.games.abstract/games/pente.
Comments are welcome --- does anyone have any more background info on Pente?

GAME
	Pente

BACKGROUND

	Unknown.  Professionally marketed by an unknown company.

RULES

	Pente is played on a 19x19 grid (a go board) with players taking black
	or white stones (yellow and red in some sets).  Players take turns,
	placing stones at any unoccupied point on the grid.  A player wins by
	placing five stones of their color in a row (either horizontally,
	vertically, or diagonally) or capturing five pairs of the opponent's
	stones.  Captures are made when a pair of stones are sandwiched on
	opposite sides.  For example:

		.......
		.OXX*..  &lt;- Moving at the "*" will give O a capture.
		.......

		.......
		.XO*X..  &lt;- Moving at the "*" is safe for O.  You cannot move
		.......     into a capture.

		.......
		.OXXX*.  &lt;- Moving at the "*" will not cause a capture.  Only
		.......     pairs of stones may be captured.

		.......
		.OXX*..  &lt;- Moving at this "*" will give O two captures at once.
		...X...
		..X....
		.O.....
		.......

	When a pair of stones are captured, they are removed from the board.

	OPTIONAL RULE

	Moving first tends to be a bit of an advantage.  To compensate for
	this, the folloing rule is sometimes added: The first player must
	begin play in the center of the board.  The second stone of the first
	player must be at least 3 space from the first.  For example:

		.......
		.xxxxx.
		.xxxxx.
		.xxOxx.  &lt;- "x"s are illegal moves for O's second stone.
		.xxxxx.		"."s are OK.
		.xxxxx.
		.......

	After the second move play continues normally.  The player who moves
	second can always play at any unoccupied space.

BASIC STRATEGY

	This is basically a variant of go-moku.  Because of the capture rule
	it is no longer necessary to prohibit moves that get multiple
	three-in-a-row combinations at once.  If you can continuously keep
	your opponent blocking your double open three in a rows or single open
	four in a rows, you can typically finally get two three in a rows with
	both sides open and force a win.
