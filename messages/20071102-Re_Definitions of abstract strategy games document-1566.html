<br>I had the same objection about themes being allowed.&nbsp; In my mind, not
<br>that I'm an authority on abstract games, but in my mind abstract games
<br>are best defined by what they don't have: no random elements, no
<br>hidden information (which would exclude simultaneous move games), and
<br>(I always thought) no theme.
<br>
<br>Now I've learned that there is some degree of consensus that abstract
<br>games may be "lightly themed."&nbsp; People who play lightly themed games
<br>will tell you that the light theme has absolutely no bearing on the
<br>gameplay and that such games are "essentially" abstract.&nbsp; Still, I
<br>have some difficulty letting go of my view of abstract games being
<br>themeless, Reversi, Go, and Checkers being good examples.
<br>
<br></blockquote>I'm broadly in agreement with this, and would like to expand on it. From
<br>what I've read on this topic over the past few weeks I have the
<br>impression of an underlying assumption that games either are or are not
<br>abstract, as if abstraction and its opposite (representation?) are
<br>watertight compartments. I think it is more accurate to regard games as
<br>falling somewhere on a linear continuum from pure abstraction at one
<br>end (Go, Draughts/Checkers, Othello etc) to what might be called
<br>extreme representationalism at the other - that's the end where role-
<br>playing games begin to merge into an overlap between game-"play" and
<br>dramatic or theatrical "plays". Perhaps half way between the two
<br>extremes come games like Hare &amp; Tortoise (if you'll pardon the
<br>presumption), which is essentially abstract but dressed up in a
<br>picturesque thematic disguise to sweeten the underlying pill of complex
<br>arithmetical calculations (if you'll pardon the mixed metaphor). A bit
<br>further to the representational end comes Monopoly, in which you are
<br>actually invited to play the part of a landlord and the skills involved 
in
<br>play are a fair representation of the relevant real-life skills.
<br>
<br>It doesn't follow, however, that any given game can necessarily be 
placed
<br>at an exact point on the scale between one end and the other of the
<br>abstract/representational continuum. Much may depend upon the way it
<br>is perceived by the players, even by different players at the same 
table.
<br>Some may be more conscious of the thematic referent than others, really
<br>imagining themselves to be playing a thematic role, while others may
<br>ignore it entirely and turn all its eventualities into a mental 
abstraction.
<br>
<br>There also appear to be several other underlying assumptions as to what 
constitutes an abstract game. Three in particular are (1) that it is a 
game of perfect information - that is, no part of the current position 
is hidden (which for example cuts out Kriegspiel); (2) that it is a game 
of pure strategy - that is, progress is not influenced by randomising 
elements such as dice (which for example cuts out Backgammon); and (3) 
the starting position should be invariable (which for example cuts out 
Chess960 and nearly all card games).
<br>
<br>I don't think any of these features should, in general, be regarded as 
essential to the definition of "abstract", which for my money simply 
means at least non-representational and ideally non-referential. 
(Reversi
<br>and Othello are the same game, and both non-representational, but
<br>Othello by its very title is referential, giving literary significance 
to the conflict between black and white.) However, that's no reason why
<br>IAGO should not simply say that it exists to promote those abstract
<br>games which exclude randomising elements, hidden information, and
<br>variable starting positions. Or, to express it more positively, which 
are
<br>games of pure strategy, perfect information, and invariable starting
<br>positions.
