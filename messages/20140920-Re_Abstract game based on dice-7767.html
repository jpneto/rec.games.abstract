Hi my friend,

I added a new rule to reduce randomness.
The player who rolls only one die has the right to substract from his score up to the outcome minus one.
Example : if he rolls 6 he could remove, 1,2,3,...or 5 points from his present as long as the score is not negative. If chooses minus 3 then his opponent has to roll 3 dice.
It will give him some control over the game.

Your big friend Hazen
