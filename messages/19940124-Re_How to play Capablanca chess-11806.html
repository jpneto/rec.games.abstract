There's a similar variation which seems to be quite popular, although
I never played it.
It's called janus chess, a janus is the same piece as your
archbishop, but here you have two of them. I have read that there
will be a janus tournament at a chess open in Saarbruecken (Germany)
in some weeks, but I don't remember the date.

BTW I know the name archbishop for a different piece: 
It's a bishop that is reflected at the sides of the board.

As far as I know the story Capablanca invented this game because he 
was afraid that chess would die for draw. But in the meantime so many
new opening ideas have been developed and chess at GM level is so
interesting that in my opinion there is no need for new rules.
