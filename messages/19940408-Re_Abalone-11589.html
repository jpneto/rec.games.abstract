I have played abalone a couple of times but only with other novices. To us
it seemed to be centered completely around trying to be as passive as 
possible, and just wait for your opponent to make a mistake. Does anyone
out there have any good strategies for more agressive play?

	Not without messing around some with the rules. The game is flawed in
that defense is too strong. You can sit with your marbles in a tight lump, and
anything your opponent does to try to get through will wind up hurting her/him
more than it will hurt you.
	Try some rule modification which favors more aggressive play, such as
"four pushes three", or a different starting position where it is more diffi-
cult to get a large cluster of marbles. For example, you could try dividing 
your marbles into two groups of seven and starting them on opposite sides of
the board. Let us know how it works.
