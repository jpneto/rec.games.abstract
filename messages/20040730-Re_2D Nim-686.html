BTW - I really <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>love<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> your idea of using a build-up phase as the preferred
form of equalization.  Brilliant.  This can obviously be applied to ANY
subtractive CGT game, such as Nim.  I wonder if it can apply to other
sorts of games as well?  It is not unlike the "adoption" equalizer
of Unlur and similar games.   Very high-tension!

What about a build-up version of a partisan game like domineering? I
think such a game can be constructed with perfectly symmetrical
build-up and removal phases:

Harry plays against Vicky. Starting from an empty configuration, both
players in turn add one or two squares to a growing polyomino. When
adding two squares, Harry has to place them horizontally adjacent, and
Vicky has to place them vertically adjacent.
At any stage, instead of adding to the configuration, a player can
decide to remove one square or two adjacent squares. Harry's double
removals are restricted to horizontally adjacent squares, and
similarly Vicky's to vertically adjacent squares. Once a player has
chosen to remove, the build-up phase has stopped and both players are
forced to make removal moves. The last player who makes a move wins.

A simple example game in which Vicky starts:

Vicky:             Harry:


   X                  XXX  
   X                  X


    X                  XXX
    X                  X
   XXX                XXX
   X                  X

Vicky starts the removal phase:

    XXX                X..
    .                  .
   X.X                X.X
   X                  X

    X..
    .
   ..X
   .                Harry gives up.
