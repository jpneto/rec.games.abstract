A man stands by an isolated restaurant on a
straight highway, 100 miles from town. Along
comes a car. The driver offers the man a lift.

"How far do you want to go?", asks the driver.
"I'm not fussy", said the man. "Drop me off at
any point where the distance between the
restaurant and town is less than 30 miles greater
than the distance between the drop off point and
town."

What is the closest the man could get to town?
What is the furthest from town he could end up?

Hmm... a bit tricky.  After reading it for the
tenth time my mind started going to mush...

Okay, the questions are:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What is the closest the man could get to town?
What is the furthest from town he could end up?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Here are the conditions:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
"Drop me off at any point where the distance
between the restaurant and town is less than
30 miles greater than the distance between
the drop off point and town."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The distance between the resturant and town is
a fixed 100 miles.  Doing a bit of substitution,
the man requests:  Drop me at any point where
100 miles is less than 30 miles greater than the
distance between that point and town.

-- OR --

Drop me at any point were:
100 miles &lt; the drop point to town plus 30 miles.

If I did that right, than the drop point needs to be
no closer than just outside 70 miles from town.
If the drop point is at 65 miles from town for
example then then distance between the resturant
and town (100 miles) is GREATER than 30
miles greater than (more than) distance between
that point and town (95 miles).

So then, going back to the questions:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What is the closest the man could get to town?
What is the furthest from town he could end up?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The Closest the man could get would be a fraction
of a length outside of 30 miles.

Assuming the driver would not drive AWAY from
town, then the furthest would be 100 miles or where
he currently is.  If the man could move away from
town than it would be half way around the world,
assuming the man needed to stay on earth.  :)
