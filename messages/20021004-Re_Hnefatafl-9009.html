Hi all -

Two questions on the "hnefatafl"-like board games of (apparently)
Scandinavian and Celtic origin:

1) How does one properly pronounce "hnefatafl"? :-)
2) In the combinatorial games literature which I own or to which I
   have easy access, I recall no discussion of these games (henefatafl
   specifically, not general "tafl" games such as 9 Men's Morris, Fox and
   Geese, etc). Nor has Google found any formal analysis; lots of other
   info on them, for example <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.htm">http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Hnef.htm</a>,
   just no formal work. Does anyone know of any?

There is another game with much more than a passing resemblance to the
hnefatafl games: Breakthru by 3M. I own a copy from eBay and it is very
similar, only the capture takes place by moving diagonally onto the enemy
square. While this seems like a radical departure from traditional
"custodial capture", it actually makes the game much more interesting, IMO.
Also, each side gets *2* moves per turn (only one if you move the
"flagship," or king). This makes it much more difficult for the escaping
player to make it to the edge, because opening up 2 lanes to the edge is not
an automatic "checkmate" like in hnefatafl.

An interesting article (not sure just how scholarly it really is) is
available at the link below:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://user.tninet.se/~jgd996c/hnefatafl/hnefatafl.html">http://user.tninet.se/~jgd996c/hnefatafl/hnefatafl.html</a>

It purports to examine the variants, goes into a bit of detail on Linnaeus'
description, and also talks about the Roman games that might ultimately be
the ancestors to tafl.

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.renstore.com">www.renstore.com</a> has a pretty nice board that folds open to store the
pieces. It's only $24 or so, and priced just about right (it's not a
super-nice version, but it is made entirely of wood). The pieces could
really use a second coat of paint, and I'll most likely give them one, now
that I'm thinking of it.
