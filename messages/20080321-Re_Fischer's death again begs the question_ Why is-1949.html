<br></blockquote>
<br>I agree that it's a weak argument, but it's a step too far
<br>to say it has produced no cheating.&nbsp; There is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of money in
<br>top-level football, and there have certainly been allegations of
<br>match-fixing, betting scams, etc., some of which have led to court
<br>cases.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I am actually curious what changes the altered scoring had on
<br>soccer. Are you aware of any analyses?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Well, I'm not.&nbsp; But there do seem to be a lot of matches
<br>decided in the last minute or two of extra time ....
<br></blockquote>
<br>Are you suggesting crookedness? Isn't that a good thing
<br>from a dramatic point of view?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>[...]
<br><blockquote type=cite>If alternate scoring eliminates the GM draw, and makes chess games,
<br>on average, more combative and more interesting, what is the downside?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Lot of "if"s there.&nbsp; Draws, GM or otherwise, in matches are
<br>completely unaffected by [sane] alternate scoring schemes, and in
<br>tournaments no-one is going to win the event just by drawing, so you
<br>are talking about draws taken for other reasons -- perhaps because
<br>the game really is utterly dead, perhaps because the players want a
<br>break from a pretty strenuous activity, perhaps because the result
<br>is, or is thought to be, irrelevant.&nbsp; Alternate scoring does not
<br>affect the first of these;&nbsp; if it affects the second, its effect is
<br>to make players play when more exhausted;&nbsp; and it may make the third
<br>less likely, but it does not affect the situation where one player
<br>needs only a draw to guarantee the win, or a title norm, or even
<br>where several players are tied for the lead.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I'm not sure of your point. If draws are worth less, players won't accept them 
so
<br>readily. They won't design their repertoires to give them positions
<br>(when Black) where they can "hold the draw". When preparing,
<br>when playing, they will look for winning chances. Isn't that what
<br>we expect of contestants in just about every other sport/game?
<br>Why is asking the same of chessplayers outrageous?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>As for more combative/interesting, it could equally have the
<br>opposite effect.&nbsp; If the stronger player has more to lose by merely
<br>drawing, the weaker player has more incentive to stodge the game up.
<br>
<br>The "downside" is merely that chess becomes, like football,
<br>a non-zero-sum game.&nbsp; This mucks up a fair chunk of game theory.
<br>Whether this is important depends on whether you are a theorist ....
<br></blockquote>
<br>Is there a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>practical<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> "downside"?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>The fundamental mystery of chess is why such a
<br>popular game has so little attention paid to its best
<br>players. The answer, I think, is that the best
<br>players are playing in competitions in which
<br>draw-producing play and strategies based
<br>on drawing rule.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I think you think wrong.&nbsp; I think the reason is that no-one
<br>outside the top players understands well enough in real time what
<br>is going on.&nbsp; You can watch a football match, and you can see that
<br>the score is 3-2 to the Reds, but the Blues have the ball and are
<br>attacking.&nbsp; You don't need any expertise at all to understand that;
<br>and you need very little to appreciate the skills involved in an
<br>accurate pass, a successful tackle, a good save, and so on.&nbsp; So
<br>billions of people can watch the World Cup final and follow the
<br>action live.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Of course, there are many reasons why chess is not
<br>as popular as football, sex, food etc. Picking extreme
<br>examples doesn't help make the case that chess is
<br>as popular as it could be.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>Try that with chess.&nbsp; It's like watching paint dry, until
<br>there is a time scramble.&nbsp; Only expert players have any idea at all
<br>what is happening.&nbsp; Many games are resigned when a club player would
<br>still have no idea what is happening.&nbsp; I can play through a game
<br>between [say] Anand and Kramnik, but the only way to understand what
<br>has happened is to have annotations, preferably provided by the
<br>players themselves, constructed hours or days after the game has
<br>happened.&nbsp; There have been valiant attempts -- the BBC had excellent
<br>coverage of the Kasparov-Short match, for example -- but they really
<br>can't compete with live coverage of football, golf, cricket, ....
<br>You would get more "action" from 5-minute chess, but then you would
<br>have even fewer prospects of getting any appreciation of what is
<br>happening in real time.&nbsp; Chess is to be played, not watched.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Go is considered more complex than chess, but seems to
<br>have bigger purses. My cable stations are filled up with
<br>"contest" shows for all sorts of activities: fishing, cooking, singing,
<br>dancing, not to mention lots of made up "sports" invented by a TV
<br>producer that have no players whatsoever. Many of these
<br>have prizes that would make top chessplayers drool.
<br>But chess has millions of casual players and almost no
<br>high-level game that those players pay attention to.
<br>
<br>By the way, I am not convinced that playing wouldn't
<br>also be improved by a less draw-favorable attitude.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>We can all agree that a 12-move draw is not usually a very
<br>exciting game of chess, and that such draws should be discouraged.
<br>But I'd be quite surprised if many people give up chess because of
<br>them.&nbsp; You seem to me to be barking up the wrong tree.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>It is unclear. Elementary school chess
<br>has large numbers and almost no draws. Participation
<br>drops with age as the draw rate increases.
