Where do you think Christian Freeling is? He's on my site, you stupid

Actually I'm still here too. I don't easily feel offended by sharp
criticism, especially if it is misdirected, and I have no problems
communicating with Mark. In fact this is a good place to post for me
because I have some stuff occasionally, and I don't want posters to
feel I'm intruding by posting too much at RGC. I also feel this site
should not be the target of a systematic boycot. Those who want to
shun it can do so, especially now that there's a good alternative.
