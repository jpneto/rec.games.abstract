Does that mean there could be a version of backgammon with simultaneous
moves in place of dice rolls?  And that such a game would be the

That's hard for me to imagine.

Every time you need to make a die roll, each player secrectly writes down
an integer. Both integers are then revealed. The sum of the two numbers
mod 6 plus 1 is what you use for he die roll. As long as the players
are opposed to each other (the reason for the zero sum assumption) then
each player is best off picking a number at random (with each remainder mod 6
equally likely). It does give players an additional way to play badly
(equivalent to telling your opponent in normal backgammon that he can
choose his next die roll), but players trying to win will pick reasonably
random numbers to avoid giving their opponent an edge.
