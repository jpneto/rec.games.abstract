No there doesn't and the point is irrelevant anyway.  If and when
something happens for the first time, such a statement of surprise

I think definitely not.  This is in fact exactly the misconception that
cost Kasparov the match against Deep Blue.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I corrected you before on this point.  The position in question took
place in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>PREVIOUS<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> match.  From this game, Kasparov was able to
learn enough about how Deep Blue was choosing its moves to quickly
bounce back and win the match in convincing fashion (of the 5 remaining
games, Kasparov won 3 and drew 2).

In the final match, Kasparov wasn't able to figure out the reasons
behind Deep Blue's moves and that was a big reason for his loss.

But in any case, neither match is relevant to my point.

While much of what you say is interesting, it is at best only
tangentially related to anything I'm saying.  If you simply want
to say something about a related topic, then I would appreciate
it if you would start a new thread and stop pretending to
address my points.  If you want to disagree with me, then I
would appreciate it if you actually address my points instead
of rambling on about some tangentially related topics.

The only point I made was in response to a definition of strategy
and tactics.  My point was that while it was a good <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>general<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
definition, it is difficult to impossible to make a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>precise<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
definition.  Not once have you addressed my point.  Instead
you have posted pages and pages of stuff that have little to
do with strategy and tactics.  I don't even know why I'm still
bothering.
