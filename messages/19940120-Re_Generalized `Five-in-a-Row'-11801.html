I was thinking about modifications of the simple `Five-in-a-row' game
(two players on a go board, winner is who first makes a contiguous line
of five stones of his colour). (It is called `gobang' sometimes.)

Generalize this to (m,n)-gobang: m players, aiming at n stones in a row.
So (2,5) is standard, (2,4) is trivial (first player always wins).
You might enjoy (3,4) which is not at all trivial. Funny situations
arise where you're forced to cooperate against your will or where
you let the third player respond to a threat against both him and yourself.

I've played a version of this called Pente, where the object is to either
get five of your colour in a row, or to capture five pairs of your
opponent(s)'s colour.  Pairs being captured by blocking two in a row (and
only two in a row) of any colour that isn't yours, and this captured pair
is then removed from play.

I've only seen this game as published by Parker Brothers.  Does anyone
know if they have exclusive copyrights to it?
