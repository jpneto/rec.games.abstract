Lol, no indeed, Here's a case in point. One of the most intelligent
summaries of what abstract games are about is "Defining the Abstract"
by J. Mark Thompson:

Allow me a quote:
"A good game should also have drama: it should be possible for a
player to recover from a weaker position and still win the game.
Victory should not be achievable in a single successful blow; the
suspense should continue through an extended campaign. Otherwise an
early disadvantage makes the remainder of the game uninteresting: the
doomed player rightly guesses that the puzzle he is trying to solve
has no solution and that thinking about it is futile. A game's drama
might be measured roughly by matching a strong player against a weak
player, and having them switch sides after the strong player achieves
an advantage. In a dramatic game the strong player will still have a
chance of winning. But the difficulty of defining "advantage" clearly
will make drama harder to measure than depth."

Reflecting on this I think, yes, that's what's lacking in Symple, and
what you get an overdose of in Charybdis (while Lhexus is
inconsequential to begin with). They were singposts: Sygo was the sole
reason for the 'symple' vision to reveal itself.

But you can only get there by whispering and listening closely to what
a game tries to convey. These are the kind of observations I'd rather
not post at r.g.c for fear of 'hijacking' threads. I was recently
accused of that at bgg (no comparison implied), for instance, by
someone who kept bothering me about a theme I wasn't really interested
in. And then Symple revealed itself and I got nasty accusations about
publishing it prematurely. Because inventors are not at liberty to do
with their games as the see fit, I suppose.

I dislike that kind of response so I'm generally careful about posting
too much. But here I can, because the other posts make me look good,
almost regardless of what I write :)
