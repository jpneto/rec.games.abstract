That sounded like a good idea to me at first glance.  But then I figured
that what would probably happen is that each player would always take two
moves (except for X's first move, where it's prohibited).  This means that X
would end up with the extra cell on the board.  So not only would X go first
but she'd always get the extra cell.

Yes, that's exactly right.  There was a thread here (I think it was here) a
few years ago about Trax being the perfect game because (under perfect play)
it was not a win for either player, and had no draw.  The only remaining
possibility I could see was that the game never ended.

My motivation was to find a new pencil-and-paper game that I could play with
an 11 year old.  The rules had to be simple but I wanted to have some depth
of strategy.

It's poosible that this game doesn't have any obvious strategy until close
to the end game.  Similar, in that regard, to Hexbo (do you know that game),
which looks like a really clever but which, to me anyway, the first
gazillion moves seem like they may as well be made at random (which may just
mean I'm too stupid to understand the game).

It might make a nice little puzzle applet, where a 5x5 board is presented,
and you know you have a win, but you have to find it.
