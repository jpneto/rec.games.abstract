Agree that on-line and OTB tourneys should 
find you players appropriate to your playing 
level.  In fact, "Swiss" style tourneys are 
set up such that if you win, you'll get a 
higher rated opponenet &amp; if you lose, a 
lower rated.  The idea is that you'll eventually 
be paired against someone about your playing level.

You have the right idea but as a tournament chess player I must point out this
is not at all accurate.

In a swiss system you're paired up against players with (or near) the same
SCORE as you -- your opponent's rating is irrelevant.  If you win a game, your
next opponent may actually have a LOWER rating than both you or your last
opponent.  Subsequently, if you lose a game your next opponent may be HIGHER
rated than both you or your last opponent.

Players are paired up against other with similar SCORES, not ratings.  Lots of
times I've lost games and then found myself paired up with someone with even a
HIGHER rating in the next round!

Your last sentence would be more accurate if it said something like "the idea
is that each round you'll be paired against someone doing about as well as you
are... in that tournament."
