Tic-Tac-Toe has gotten somewhat trite, but some of its generaliza-
tions are very interesting.  The original Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in
2 dimensions on a square 3 units on a side in which 2 players take
turns filling empty squares until 3 squares in a row have been
filled by the same player, who is declared the winner.  There are
four variable parameters here: the dimension-space of the board,
the size of the board, the number of players, and the number of
squares which a player must line up to win.  A generalization of
Tic-Tac-Toe could be:

     A game in d dimensions on an a hypercubic board board s units
     on a side, in which p players take turn claiming empty cells
     until l squares in a line all belong to the same player.

For any game, let us call [p,d,s,l] the parameter vector.
Let us define some terms:

     trivial:       Player 1 can always force a win.
     non-trivial:   Player 1 can not always force a win.
     solvable:      There exists an algorithm by which Player 1
                    will never lose.
     insoluble:     There does not exist a finite algorithm by
                    which Player 1 will never lose.

Obviously:

p &gt; 2
l &lt;= s
pl &lt; s^d

Some interesting results that can be proven:

[p,d,s,l] is always solvable if s and d are finite.
[2,2,3,3] (Traditional Tic-Tac-Toe) is non-trivial.
[2,3,3,3] (3x3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe) is trivial.
[2,3,4,4] is non-trivial, according to TicTactics, from the
     Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows (c) Microsoft Co.
[2,d,2,2] is trivial.
[2,d&gt;3,3,3] is trivial.
[2,2,infinity,0&lt;l&lt;5] is trivial.

Some conjectures:

[2,d,d,d] is trivial.
[2,d,d+1,d+1] is non-trivial.
[2,2,infinity,5+] is trivial.


Can anyone add to this list or examine these conjectures further?
