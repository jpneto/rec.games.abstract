<br>No.&nbsp; The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is biased toward White, at least as currently played.
<br></blockquote>
<br>This is just wrong. Playing with 1867-scoring, we'd prefer White.
<br>Playing with BAP scoring, we'd prefer Black. No doubt there is a
<br>scoring systems that would make the colors equally desirable.
<br>
<br>The point is that the same theoretical objection you raised for BAP
<br>is equally present for traditional scoring. Hence, it is not a valid objection,
<br>even though I have conceded that BAP is unfair.

<br>Mig Greengard and Joel Benjamin aren't `random folks' -- they're

<br>If they wish to enter the debate, they are welcome to. It hardly

<br></blockquote>
<br>It is, as I have pointed out before, unreasonably of you to suggest
<br>that I am in some way deficient for failing to provide statistical
<br>evidence of the effect of something that has never been tried.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I never requested statistical evidence. But the fact that you
<br>haven't provided <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> evidence is telling.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Oh, for crying out loud.&nbsp; It's telling of the fact that this is an
<br>untried idea.&nbsp; I cannot possibly produce any concrete evidence.&nbsp; Just
<br>as you cannot produce any concrete evidence against the hypothesis
<br>that the first words spoken from Mars will be `Damn, but I fancy a
<br>bacon sandwich.'
<br></blockquote>
<br>This is not correct. The basis of your objection is that
<br>non zero-sum scoring will produce cheating, but the fact is that
<br>chess is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>already<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that way when prizes are considered. So we
<br>have tried the experiment, can examine the evidence, and draw conclusions.
<br>
<br>You refuse to, for obvious reasons.

<br><blockquote type=cite>but empirically the half point draw has produced a situation where

<br></blockquote>
<br>No.&nbsp; Empirically, the half-point draw has coincided with a situation
<br>where contestants occasionally avoid playing real games.
<br>
<br>I have nothing further to say to you on this subject or any other.

<br></blockquote>
<br>The point is that you haven't said anything meaningful yet.
<br>You are stuck with your prejudices and can't bring yourself
<br>to move beyond them.
