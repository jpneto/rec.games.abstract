                        SECOND REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION

                      CREATION OF "REC.GAMES.MINIATURES"

Copies on request from <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:bob@werple.apana.org.au">bob@werple.apana.org.au</a>

NOTES SINCE 1st RFD.

      *** IMPORTANT ***

      An alternate mailbox is being sought to take the vote for the
      creation of this newsgroup as my site has revised it's support for the
      creation of this group due to network affiliate limitations.

      If you can help please mail me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:bob@werple.apana.org.au">bob@werple.apana.org.au</a>

      ******************

      PLEASE, if you want your opinions known post or mail to the
      NEWS.GROUPS newsgroup. I cannot post them for you.

      If you feel any part of this proposal should be altered or changed
      please bring the matter up for discussion on news.groups.
      If we can get concensus for a change then it will be done.
      The proposal is what you make it.

      The gating of this proposed newsgroup to a mailing list has been
      suggested for people without a newsfeed. If you can help please
      post to news.groups or mail me.

      Several people have inquired as to the voting requirements for the
      group's creation. I have included a summary at the end of the RFD.

      Please note that voting for this proposal will NOT take place
      until at least the 17th of February, provided a concensus has been
      reached about the content of the group. Any votes mailed to me
      cannot be accepted (and may not be tallied by me in any case) as
      a Call for Votes (CFV) has not yet been issued detailing where the
      votes are to be sent. Please wait for the CFV.

MAILING TO NEWS.GROUPS

      People who do not have a newsfeed who wish to register their views
      in news.groups can mail to a news gateway by following these

DISCUSSION SINCE THE 1st RFD

       Discussion seems to have indicated that there is a need for this
       newsgroup. The vote will ultimately determine if the audience exists for
       it. Please refer to the VOTING section of this RFD for the
       requirement for group creation.

       One concern of note have been raised by one or two people regarding
       the inclusion of Fantasy/SF miniatures in this group as "noise".

       Also, several questions have been raised about the status of a
       modelling or collecting related discussions in a "rec.games" group.

                       SECOND REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION


RFD for creation of rec.games.miniatures group for tabletop miniature
wargamers in any period. Also mailed to Harpoon, Figures, Conflict
Simulation, Squad Leader, Pre-gunpowder, EIA and SFB mailing lists for
distribution to their readership.

REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION

  Create an UNMODERATED Usenet newsgroup called "rec.games.miniatures".

  This announcement is cross-posted to newsgroups and mailing lists whose
  readers may have an interest in the discussion about the new group;
  follow-up discussion will take place in "news.groups".
  Suggestions, comments or problems may also be emailed to me at
  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:bob@werple.apana.org.au">bob@werple.apana.org.au</a>.

PURPOSE

  The newsgroup "rec.games.miniatures" would be a forum for discussing
  the all aspects of the hobby of tabletop miniature wargaming of all
  periods, from figure painting, terrain construction, historical information
  and army and unit composition through to rulesets, tabletop tactics,
  scenarios, campaigning and competitions.

  A "rec.games.miniatures" newsgroup would provide its readers an opportunity
  to discuss their experiences with other hobbyists, sharing skills, ideas,
  information and techniques on topics discussed.

  One major aim of the group is to provide a focus for hobbyists on the net
  to gain assistance from others in finding solutions to specific
  problems, e.g. locating information and sources for a topic or range
  of figures, rules or terrain materials or providing information on a
  new period a player wishes to try out.

RATIONALE

  Much of the miniatures related discussion takes place on a number of
  diverse mailing lists, some of which are published in edited, digest form.
  As many miniatures gamers play more than one period, this requires
  subscription to multiple mailing lists. As lists are not widely
  publicised, relevant discussion can be easily missed. As list
  subscriptions are small compared to newsgroup readership, It is likely
  that many potential tabletop miniature readers may be missing out on
  participating in discussion as no central forum exists.

  As has been the case with other newsgroups, which had their basis in
  mailing lists, signing up formally to a list and then sending mail to
  publish an article takes a commitment of time. Some sites place
  restrictions on mailing list subscription.   Because participation in
  a newsgroup is easy, immediate, and spontaneous, it is hoped this will
  encourage and facilitate a greater amount of information and skill sharing
  among players of tabletop miniature wargames.

CONTENT

and genres.      The periods concerned are too many to enumnerate here.

NEWSGROUP CREATION

  The discussion period will be from 20 January 1993 to 17 February 1993.

  Please post all discussion in "news.groups".

  If a consensus is reached by  the end of the discussion period,
  a CFV (Call for Votes) will be posted at that time.

  The voting period will last for 30 days.

CREATION REQUIREMENTS (summarized)

If a need for the group has been demonstrated by the end of the RFD
period a Call for Votes (CFV) may be issued.

If no concensus as to the proposal or need for the group can be reached
by the end of the RFD period the discussion must go offline i.e. mail and
a proposal ironed out amongst the proponents. Once this has been done a
new RFD process must be started.

Once the vote has been taken a tally of votes addresses (and names if
available) will be posted to all the lists and newsgroups on which the
RFD appeared. The list indicates a vote result plus who voted for or
against the creation proposal.

A 5-day waiting period is held to determine if there are any irregularities
which might invalidate the vote.

AFTER the waiting period, and if there were no serious objections that might
invalidate the vote, and if 100 more valid YES/create votes are received
than NO/don't create AND at least 2/3 of the total number of valid votes
received are in favor of creation, a newgroup control message may be sent
out.  If the 100 vote margin or 2/3 percentage is not met, the group should
not be created.

A proposal which has failed the vote above should not again be brought up
for discussion until at least six months have passed from the close of the vote.

This limitation does not apply to proposals which never went to vote.
