Since mjd only heard this from a friend, he seems to have not heard
of the best part of the game.

Originally it was devised as part of the BBC Radio 4 programme ``I'm
Sorry I Haven't A Clue'' which is a spoof panel game.  The two teams
of panellist would take it in turns to name stations, and along the
way invoke archaic (and, naturally, completely ficticious) rules and
tactics.

This is a special example of the general class of games where one or
more players don't know the rules, like the "Chairmain Mao" card game
(which I think was also described in Scientific American with the name
of "Elusis").  The difference with Mornington Crescent is that there
are no rules.

A similar game is The Power Game where one player starts off by saying
"Power, power, power, he who has the power has it now".  The power
then passes to another player who must repeat the incantation.  The
secret rule is that it is the next person to talk who get the power
but it usually takes a long time before people realise that.
