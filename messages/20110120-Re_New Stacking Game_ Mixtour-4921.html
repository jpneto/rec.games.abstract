Hi Christian,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I have a couple of questions regarding the rules:

- "Generally, discs move orthogonally or diagonally in straight
lines."

I have found no instance where stacks moved otherwise, so why the
"Generally"?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Bad English, it seems; this is what I want to say: "first of all, have
in mind that all pieces move in those directions, further restrictions
follow in this text". I will correct this, thanks.

- "Players try to build stacks, at least 5 discs high, with a disc of
their own color on top."

Since such a stak is removed on completion, the last move of the
player must have been with a stack with his own color on top. "Of

No, you've got this wrong! ... see below

course" I hear you say. "players move only stacks with their color on
top".
Right. But then what about this?:
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Players may move discs of any(!) color."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Now I understand that this must confuse you...

Actually this means, regarding <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>moves<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, players can actually take any
disc on the board and move it, regardless of color. It can even be the
top of a stack. The receiver stacking mechanism can handle this, you
have to try it yourself. Wow?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Apart from these remarks, you've made an elegant game on a mechanism
that also crossed my mind in the beginning: Daniel's Charisma applied
to stacks rather than groups.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Strangely, I discovered the similarity only recently after the game
was completed. Maybe it was in the back of my head during the whole
process.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Note also that your entering procedure
is the same as Trounce's: entering or moving in the same phase of a
game. This is an undervalued procedure, although it is older than
Methusalem, as testified by Nine Men's Morris.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like this procedure very much. Players have to deal with material
vs. tempo.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The exhausting part of the process was probably related to the object.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It was also extensive computer-aided playtesting, something I did the
very first time. It was a great experience, but sometimes felt like
work.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I couldn't find one fitting the mechanism and diverted to elimination
and the Focus/Explosion mechanism. There's a smell of the arbitrary
surrounding Mixtour's object, although the mechanism connects
boardsize to stack height in a clever way to remove it for a large
part. But not entirely: "Generally, 5 points are needed to win a game
(5 is the number of Mixtour), but players can agree upon any other
number at the beginning of the game."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I know, I know! So I must say something about this: of course I wanted
to define the end with one completed 5-stack. But I figured it could
have resulted in too short games where some kind of first- or second
move advantage could emerge; on the other hand I didn't want to break
up this beautiful "fiveness" in the game. So, one winning stack is
still a way to go for stiff purists, the light-hearted ones can go
with the next snapping point at 5.

Finally, my compliments for the presentation!

Thank you,

ps. this was a lot of discussion on one single day ;)
