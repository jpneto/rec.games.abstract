But why do you need to worry about what the American Checker Federation

Of course, you don't need to worry about it at all.  People play
checkers with the very common red and black boards with red and black
plastic pieces, and enjoy the game without further effort.

The ACF specs, though, call for a board and pieces that is very
pleasant to use, with appealing color combinations that are easy on
the eyes.  The more common black plastic pieces on black squares can
be hard to see (maybe that's an advantage at times?) and I find the
red/black on red/black color combination harsh.

But yes, the game is the same, and I will play as poorly with one set
as I would with the other, I suppose.

I do feel that with chess sets it can make a larger difference.  Some
chess sets are unpleasant to use, and some of the more outre designs
cause confusion.  (Is that a Bishop?  Or what is it anyhow?)  I have a
large metal chess set which I like as an aesthetic ensemble (the king
weighs 18 ounces, I think, and doubles as a weapon) but it is not
especially useful for play, as under most lighting the black and white
pieces don't have nearly enough color contrast and it is too easy to
mistake a white piece for a black.  The tournament specs however call
for boards and pieces that are generally easy to use and practical.
(Although there are exceptions!  Once I played in an outdoor
tournament in Hawai`i, and sets which were "single weight" but still
up to tournament specs were literally blowing in the wind.)
