This is all 'intuition' of course, and since mentioning that concept
will trigger a response by Mark anyway, it would be nice to hear
something more insightful about Yodd than "it sounds like a Kris Burm

There aren't many games like that. The few that are, like Amazons,

block off territories where you you'd want to avoid putting stones.

I'm starting to see the tactics by playing through mini-situations in
my head and they look tantalizing.
