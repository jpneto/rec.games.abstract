The bgg abstract games forum will never make it as a serious game
discussion forum.  There's tons of traffic but spirited debate is all
but prohibited.  How can you bgg guys stand being lorded over by a
giant, staggering transvestite in size 13 high heels, whipping anyone
who comes within reach with a family size Slim Jim?  Mistress Octavia
effectively stifles all attempts to develop an actual topic.

Bgg was set up for socializing, period.  What's a good game to bring
along on a first date?  (Yes, that was an actual topic.) Who thinks
Puerto Rico is better than Carcassonne? My favorite gipf game (as
fizzy mentioned).

Richard Hutnik created this topic (also mentioned by fizzy) in the bgg
abstract games forum: "Would IAGO having an extended abstract strategy
games database make it a rival to BGG?"  The only reason iago would
ever have any chance of "rivaling" bgg is that Aaron Dalton is
programming iago behind the scenes.  Not because ignoramus Richard
Hutnik is out apologizing for abstract games all day.  ("The idea is
to grow all aspects of boardgaming, rather than have abstract strategy
try to take over a larger chunk of the pie.")

Can you believe the founder of the International Abstract Games
Organization even said that??  In an abstract games forum????  With
advocates like Richard Hutnik, who needs detractors?
