Hello group,

I am hoping someone more versed in the mysteries of game theory might help
me out on an issue. For a given position in a given game, are there any
smooth ways to calculate which possible lines of play might have led to that
position?

Specifically, I need to do this to an early endgame position in awale (to
include in a piece of fiction). I have tried exploring the variation root by
hand, but given the nature of the game, it grows immensely big after a very
short time. So I am at a loss. Is there any software that does this kind of
thing, or articles conserning it?

While I'm at it: Is there a standard way of recording a game of awale?
Thanks for any help consering all (or some) of this.
