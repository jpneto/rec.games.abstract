|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Monster: White sets up normaly, black sets up only his king and the four
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;center pawns (all one space ahead of normal).  Black can move twice for
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;each white move and blacks pawns cannot advance.
|&gt;   
|&gt; I've played a number of games of Monster with several of my chess friends,
|&gt; but the four Black center pawns started on their normal squares and moved
|&gt; normally.  All of my opponents were "A" class, Candidate Master ("Expert"),
|&gt; or Master class chess players.
|&gt; 
|&gt; We found that Black appears to have a large edge in practice, but that
|&gt; White tends to do better as she gains experience.

|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;Two questions: can black's pawns capture?  Can black use his two moves
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;to move trough check on the first?
|&gt; 
|&gt; We played with yes to both questions.  Both are essential to Black's tactics.
|&gt; 
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;Let's see.  If no, no, then this is a pretty simple win for white, and
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;the only varisble is # of moves.  If yes/no, black still seems dead.  If
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;no/yes or yes/yes, then black has considerable stall power, but no chance
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;&gt;of winning, and can still only get the stalemate by white error.
|&gt; 
|&gt; I disagree with the latter statement, as I recall winning about 70% of the
|&gt; games with the Monster against stronger (chess) opposition.  One friend,
|&gt; who is a very creative tactician, won closer to 90%.  But we seem to be
|&gt; talking about different games (Black would be hard-pressed to win without
|&gt; moving her pawns).  I will also qualify my results by noting that it is
|&gt; hard to distinguish between a strong position and Black's incredibly rich
|&gt; swindle potential (ie. the Monster can win a lot of "lost" positions).

|&gt;   &gt;&gt;the way i played this was yes/yes  and there is no way for White to avoid
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;checkmate.  the double-moving king is more powerful than a Queen.  this
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;first came to my attention as a bar trick to get a free drink off an
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;unsuspecting rube.  the pawns are unnecessary, but put in to make the
|&gt;   &gt;&gt;problem seem plausible.
|&gt; 
|&gt; We have never found a forced win for Black, but I would not claim that none
|&gt; exists -- our analysis has never been that thorough.  The pawns are
|&gt; absolutely essential, since otherwise there is no way to assail White's
|&gt; initial position, as pointed out by:

|&gt;   &gt;I have my doubts.  To start, let white's strategy be to move only the
|&gt;   &gt;two rook pawns.  I do not think black can stop both, so white will
|&gt;   &gt;eventually have a queen and two rooks free.  During this time the king
|&gt;   &gt;will be safe and black cannot move his pawns nor can he bring his king
|&gt;   &gt;past to the 7th rank (as the whole 6th rank is in check by the pawns,
|&gt;   &gt;so he can't start a move there, and the whole 7th rank is protected by
|&gt;   &gt;the rook/bishop/royalty).
|&gt; 
|&gt;   &gt;At this point white can use the two rooks and the queen to mate (even
|&gt;   &gt;against a superking) by creating a three space wide check zone, and
|&gt;   &gt;marching the king to doom.  Protecting the three peices from attack,
|&gt;   &gt;while not easy,is possible with good play.
|&gt; 
|&gt; This analysis is mostly correct.  But mating with a Queen and two Rooks is
|&gt; easier said than done!  I would need to have this shown to me before I
|&gt; accept it.  I remember winning a few games against this strategy, but only
|&gt; because other weaknesses allowed me to attack the White King from the flank
|&gt; (eg. K/c4 - b3 - a2 (if the original White Queen has moved away, we now
|&gt; threaten Kxb1 Kxc1 checkmate!), and then eating all of White's Queenside).
|&gt; 
|&gt;   &gt;The only trick would be that this would possibly take more than 50 moves
|&gt;   &gt;after obtaining the queen, and white could not afford any pawn moves
|&gt;   &gt;during this time, so black could claim stalemate this way.
|&gt;   
|&gt;   &gt;Lifting the 50 move rule, I still think black is doomed, unless there is
|&gt;   &gt;a flaw in this strategy I overlooked.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Well, you may be right.  But in our games, it seemed that the Monster
|&gt; always came up with new resources, and we never did perfect a winning
|&gt; strategy for White (but again, our objective was not to solve the game).
|&gt; 

I am used to playing Monster chess where White actually starts with
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> his pawns, but even then we found that Black could easily win 
by blocking or sacrificing minor pieces for several of superpawns, and
then pushing back the remaining king with his quen and two rooks (it
is really not that difficult).  

So, unless White is hurt by having 4 extra pawns, I think the version
you are discussing here is even easier for Black to win.
