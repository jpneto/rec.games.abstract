Why don't you put a little more effort into explaining what you do mean,
Christian.  Then you won't have to spend so much time refuting what you
don't mean.

I said: "its perfectly working and aestetically pleasing

Your current description of Sygo's balancing mechanism is considerably less
horse shit than your previous description:

  "To restate the obvious: it means that the move protocol and its
  balancing mechanism will in a hypothetical world with a large
  player base have these games naturally and inevitably converge
  to a 50/50 win/lose overall score at the highest level of play."

....but it's still horse shit.  No balancing mechanism is "perfectly
working", whatever the fuck that even means.  You're trying to save face,
Christian.  Trying to salvage something after I shredded your "50/50
convergence" asininity.  You're playing a game of semantics in a language
not your own - a fool's game.  Ralf Gering got bounced off the Internet for
that shit.

Stop perpetuating the discussion with ever more asinine, self-glorifying

Nor were they ever intended to, even though you have already blamed me for
Sygo's dudliness.  I made the one comment, when I first learned of Sygo,
that its balancing mechanism was an aesthetic Hiroshima.  At the time, I
didn't know that the balancing mechanism was actually a point of pride, or I
might not have said anything about it.  I was just making a remark, not
imposing a sentence of dudliness.
