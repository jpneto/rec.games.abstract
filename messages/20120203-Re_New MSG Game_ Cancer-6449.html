The Atlantis mechanism was so named after Martin Medema's game
Atlantis, eight years before

And Martin was familiar with and possibly inspired by Eric Solomon's
Alaska that had been published a year before:

Lots of games vary their board shape and size during play.  What's
your point?

But Symple is interesting.  This is why you've been mumbling to
yourself in the Arimaa forum for the past fifteen months, continually,
with no end in sight.

I understand, Christian.  I insulted your game, and now you have to
insult my game.  Here's the difference.  I presented Cancer as a
common variant.  No outlandish claims.  I'm not calling Cancer the
most sophisticated game in the current multiverse and all possible
future multiverses.

Say what you will about Cancer, but be clear on one thing.  No game
could ever be as ugly as Symple, in the current multiverse or any
possible future multiverse.  It's ugly and retarded, like the younger
sister you killed when you were eight years old.
