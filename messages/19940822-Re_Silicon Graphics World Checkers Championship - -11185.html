Hey guys I hate to ruin your party but this discussion group
is rec.games.chess, that's right <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>chess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> NOT checkers. You've
wasted enough bandwidth already and I have better things to do
than edit my kill file. Could you please move this f*cking
thread elsewhere? Thank you.

Please understand that this is not a flame nor is it intended to be 
sarcastic. In fact a reasonable answer could even change my behavior.

Obviously putting a note about checkers on this conference seems to have 
upset you plenty, even though we've seen comparisons between chess and go 
on this conference. In times past people have compared chess playing 
computers with checker playing computers so there is some overlap...

Let me ask you, do you read every posting in this conference or do you look 
at the directory and pick out the stuff you want to read. If the latter, 
can't you just hit the down arrow past the checkers stuff? 

Or, on the other hand is this a question of principle... that Chess 
conferences should be for chess only, just on principle... no intermixing 
of conferences... is that your thinking? I believe this is something upon 
which reasonable men may disagree... 

Or is it something else. Again, I just want to know what bugs you so much 
about a checkers post on the chess conference...

All non-chess related postings on RGC "bug" me. Even with a threaded news
reader I find myself skipping over a lot of material, some of it even chess
related. The point is it shouldn't be neccessary to spend so much time
weeding out articles. I subscribe to many other newsgroups and people are
doing the same thing there, posting articles that have nothing to do with
the charter of the group. So I find myself spending a significant amount of
time screening articles and in some cases have actually had to modify the
"kill" file because abuse was so blatant. Why do people think so many
newsgroups exist? If you can't find an appropriate group for your subject
of interest and a lot of support exists for it (which is apparently the
case with the computer checkers thread) why not form a new discussion group
or form a private discussion? Is it fair to just dump postings unrelated to
the charter on an existing group? I contend that anyone ought to be able to
start reading articles at a random point in any group and at least have some
expectation that the article which comes up is vaguely related to the charter.
In a nutshell, I support the principle that there be intermixing of conferences
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>ONLY<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> when a clear connection is apparent to the casual reader. As you can
surmise from my above statements I hold this view for pragmatic reasons. If
it becomes necessary for someone to invent a rationale for cross postings then
they shouldn't have occured in the first place. Again my apologies to the
regular RGC crowd for having to endure this.

I do get the impression you waste more of your time in writing these
messages than you waste in deleting checkers articles or editing kill-files.
