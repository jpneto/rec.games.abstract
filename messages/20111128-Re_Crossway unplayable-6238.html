The example game was a little lopsided.  There isn't a huge data sample to
draw on.

Fritzd is Paul van Wamelen, the best Crossway player I know of.  He
developed the Ninja tactics.  Chmeee is Nie Wiescz, world renowned Hex
player.  His Crossway play is comparatively weak.

I've got a lovely way to clear all this up, Nihlus.  Go to Richard Rognlie's
Gamerz.net, and challenge Fritzd to a game of Crossway, with you moving
first.  Claim the center point and ask Fritzd not to invoke the pie rule,
which I suspect he will oblige.  Then watch yourself get totally creamed,
Ninja style.  That should remove all of your doubts about the validity of
Crossway.  Let me know how it turns out.

Perhaps it is time to make this discussion more constructive. I do not
claim that this game is broken, i.e. it is trivially autowin for any
side. Please note I said that the first move assault CAN be stopped
before it reaches the edge. It may well turn out that at this point
the side pushing the attack will be in serious trouble so a previous
restraint should be exercised. The problem is elsewhere. Grab a goban
or MultiGo program and look at the following examples:

1) Black: K10, White: K6, M8, O6, M6, M4, L5, K4, L4, L3

The L3 move is the tenth move in the game and only then the X pattern
starts to work. The real problem here is that the Black's tactic's is
entirely trivial: move in steps of two, but the tactics for White have
to be calculated with surgical precision five moves forward - misplace
one stone and the game is over. Calculating such long exact sequences
in over the board play is very difficult. This creates a huge
imbalance between the attacking and defending side (not necessarily
specifically between Black and White). You may proudly claim 'I do not
play the game I make the the game' but not playing the game makes you
blind to the practical difficulties your games create in real play.
Difficulties which can render the game 'unplayable' from the practical
point of view, not 'broken' in the sense of a trivial winning tactics.

Another example:

2) K10, K6, K7, K8, L8, L9, M10, M9, N9, N8

This is another sequence forced by putting the second black stone on
K7. The reply K8! is far from trivial and required a lot of trial and
error on my part to discover. Essentially every move in this game
becomes a complicated puzzle requiring in excess of 10 plies of
analysis just to avoid immediate disaster which in practice excludes
any long term planning and turns the game into a russian rulette for a
vast majority of players (if not for all of them). And for every game
the community of players forms a pyramid - without a wide base there
can be no high summit.

The game is not trivial just too tactical to play. I would compare it
to solving the traveling salesman problem by hand. It theory feasible
in practice not so much.
