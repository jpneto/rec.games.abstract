hex 2014 by turn 3, then that's tactics.

Take go: my strategy would be how loosely I arrange my pieces at first, or
whether I immediately attack an opponent's corner, or something like that.
Tactics would be how I position individual pieces (making reference to the
intersections, for example).

It's all a question of granularity. I think the scope of the game counts

a lot. What might be strategic in Bitter Woods is too granular for even a
discussion of tactics in Axis and Allies. So the game's scope is a big
determinant of what will be classed as strategy and what tactics.

Hope this helps!

Well, it's a start... Let's try this another way.

-Avoid entering enemy units ZOC's during movement.
 That's without reference specific individual units, but it has such a
 strong tactical element to it, I hesitate to label it strategy.

-Attack units when you have a tactical advantage.
 Strategy or tactics?

-Actually attacking a unit in the open with one under cover (terrain
advantage).
 Tactical decision or strategic?

-Securing supply lines

-Flanking an enemy

I started this after watching an argument in comp.ai.games
on whether chess or Age of Empires has more `tactical depth'.
 From the programming standpoint, chess responds well to
alpha-beta searches, I imagine AoE is driven by a general
rule based system. That could be seen as encouragement that
chess places responds better to tactical analysis than AoE
at the very least. I de-lurked briefly to see if terms could
be defined but the post was mostly ignored.
