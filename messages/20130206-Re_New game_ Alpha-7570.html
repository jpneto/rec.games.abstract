I wouldn't go as far as to say that Alpha is better than Produto, though. I'd have to test it more thoroughly first.

Related to a general frustration I have: I think most of us are too prone to judging games without first playing them. I'm increasingly skeptical of the idea that you can know how a game plays by examining the rules. I've seen judgments on unplayed games turn out to be wildly wrong too many times to trust them anymore (speaking both of my own judgements and those of others).

For the record, I said I liked the object of Alpha better. I didn't say the game was better. I like the object better because a) it is not arbitrary, while considering "the two largest groups" is just a bit arbitrary, and b) the argument I gave about the threat in Alpha being "clear and present general threat". You don't have to actually play the game to see that. 

In Produto you have to specifically consider the say 3, maybe 4 largest groups, of which two are the 'target' for a connection (provided the third largest group is small enough). In Alpha you have to consider all groups for possible connection by the opponent.
