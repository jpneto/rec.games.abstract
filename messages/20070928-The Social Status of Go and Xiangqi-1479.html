I am very interested in the cultural status of Go and Xiangqi in China. In
the US (where I live) international chess is being promoted in many schools.
There's a body of research that indicates that students improve greatly
academically when they study and play chess. Is Go or Xiangqi or both
promoted in Chinese schools?

What is the status of Go relative to Xiangqi in Chinese culture? In the
West, generally speaking, international chess is considered an
"intellectual" pursuit and it's players are considered highly intelligent.
There's no money in it if you play in the US (I hear it's better in Europe),
but it's a respectable game.

 From what I've read, Xiangqi appears to be a game for the "masses." For
example, Sam Sloan,  in "Chinese Chess for Beginners" says that nearly
everyone in China knows how to play xiangqi."

In contrast, in "Games Ancient and Oriental", Edward Falkener suggests that
Go in Chinese culture is considered a game for the "elite." A person who
seriously plays Go would be expected to be a person of accomplishment and
refinement in China.

A quick search on ebay shows Xiangqi sets made of plastic or cheap wood with
paper boards are quite inexpensive.  Go equipment on ebay or from, say,
Yellow Mountain Imports, can be quite expensive.  Can this difference
between the two games be taken as a sign of their different social status?

I'd be grateful if you could provide any assistance or insight to my
research.



Thank you.
