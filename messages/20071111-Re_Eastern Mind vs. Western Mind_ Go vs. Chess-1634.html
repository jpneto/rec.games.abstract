May I ask what evidence you looked at to come to that conclusion?

It's your theory, if you can even call it that, and the burden of
proof is on you.  Your entirely subjective, kooky diatribe and your
long list of book titles only provide evidence that you're a couple
beers short of a six pack, nothing more.

In contrast, Go, a territorial game of maneuver, has had a hold on Asia
that Xiangqi, Shogi and international Chess have never attained
historically. Businessmen of Japan and military leaders of China often
express their strategies in terms of Go whereas their American
counterparts would never do so.

Sure, if I think I've made a particularly salient point in an argument
I might say "checkmate".  That's a long, long way from Chess having a
"hold" on me or on society as a whole.

I think you've identified a psychological disorder that happens to
people who play a particular game way too much.  Eventually they start
to "see things."  The game becomes more than just a game.  It takes on
an elevated, aggrandized purpose in their thought process and, so they
believe, assumes a prominent role in society at large.

I probably shouldn't say anything more about this.  I don't want you
to seek me out and kill me as a way of enacting a checkmate.
