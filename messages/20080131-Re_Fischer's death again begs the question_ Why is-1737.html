chess.

And, of course, since the way to learn to spell well is to read a lot,
it isn't surprising that it's newspapers that sponsor spelling bees.

I mean, if the United States government felt it had to sponsor
cultural activities such as chess and classical music in order to
prove that it was a civilized, cultured nation - and to provide
constructive leisure activities for the laboring masses - then Fischer
would have been just one of a cadre of dozens of American grandmasters
who would dominate the world chess scene.

Of course, in that alternate universe, presumably Russia would be the
foremost nation dedicated to liberty, in which the excesses of free
enterprise occasionally produce lapses of taste (i.e., equivalents to
Hollywood and Las Vegas in the United States of our universe).

Possibly North Korea will emerge as a country with significant
governmental chess sponsorship.

Of course, there are countries with traditions of interest in chess,
and so it may be that eventually a solidly democratic Russia, along
with Germany, France, and, say, an Israel secure and at peace, see a
resurgence in chess-related activities. Even at present, the chess
scene is doing well enough - those who are interested in playing chess
competitively have good opportunities to do so. But as for chess
becoming a mass spectator sport - in the United States, at least, that
is a dream that has proven to be a will o' the wisp, and barring
unusual circumstances, it is likely to remain so.
