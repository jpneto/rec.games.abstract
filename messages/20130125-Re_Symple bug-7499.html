Hear, hear.  Subjecting the players to an exhaustive stone counting ritual when the game should already be over is Geringesque.

Play on a physical board is a big concern for me.  All of my games are designed primarily for real world play.  Computer play is secondary.

Symple is not a game.
Symple as other games of Christian Freeling are "bad-solution-games" for existing games.
The same conclusion is valid for Markrappy games.

Here is the philosophy of designing games :

- any game in fact does not belong to his designer. Only the players can give the game his "definitive" form.
- designing is creating new mechanisms news components new games area (boardgames or anything like) new rules new strategies new tactics...

No one of you created something new.
You change only superficial aspects of the games.

What about a game who never finishes? but where every hour of game is unique and different from others.
You can play it all your life...
Why are you trying to put "absurd constaints" on games?
A game could be theoretically draw but practically drawless.
A game could be easy to master but with 10.000 of was to win. If the game is fun then where is the problem. Any language is composed with words syntax and so on but anyone interesting can change the way you talk. Nothing is eternal.
A game with cycles? why not yes if the goal of the game is to try to solve the cycles. When a cycle occur the 2 players try to solve it. What is really a problem is that only one of the players can force the cycle. If one of the players can break it then it is not a cycle. Building a game on cycles is a big challenge. Any rule used to prohibit the cycle for example is the kind of "botched" solution. It take time to find the right rule. Elegancy is hard to reach.
When Markrappy prohibit on 2x2 a cross (b-w-w-b) to make the game played in square board he solved nothing!!! He produced a Hex clone. No impact at all on the playing.
The same is valid for Slither and other botched solutions.
