I will use a metaphor to define what chaos means in games.
Imagine someone who spent lot of time building sand castle and then a guy come an remove part of the castle. So the one who is trying to build need to repair the damage. But when he starts to repair ideas come to his his mind to change what he plans originally to do. He will fix the damage but differently.
As it is a game then each player is going cause a damage to the opponent castle. This will go indefinitely. In the end after many "turns" no one will build castle in fact. Each player will have to minimize his efforts to build something interesting. Less efforts to better result. 
That is in few words the core of chaotic games.
More sophisticated models will include set of rules where each player could apply under constraints. Out of 10 rules he need to use for each "round" (filling the board, emptying the board) only 5 rules for example. The rules used by both players could be different. They are part of the game play.
I recognize anyway that it will hard to establish equivalency between rules.. This will surely lead to the use of some rules rather than others.
A mechanism of equating the rules seems to be necessary.
