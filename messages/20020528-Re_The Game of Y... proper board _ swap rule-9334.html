|&gt; 1) The Zillions board is slightly different than that of the board

|&gt; 
|&gt; Can I assume the boards shown in the above two links are the official
|&gt; "Y" board, and the hexagon board used when playing with the Zillions
|&gt; engine is simply one of many alternate boards to play on?

|I think the simple hexagon board was the original format,
|and that the inventors later found that the slightly
|altered board gave a better game. Surely the hexagons are
|easier to implement on Zillions. HTH.

I haven't downloaded the Zillions Y package, but I assume you mean
a 'plain' triangular grid. This would indeed be easier to implement,
not just for the sake of the 'grid' command, but because the game object
would be much easier to define. Ea described the process to me:

Suppose the grid were filled with tokens, and suppose the tokens
were spherical, held in place on the 'bottom' layer. A triangular
pyramid of spheres could be built up, one layer at a time, each
layer is a triangular grid with side length one unit less than
the layer it sits on. The color of each token is determined by the
colors of the three tokens it rests on. Majority rule wins; e.g.
if two of the base tokens are white then the next layer token is
white. The color of the top token determines the winner of the game!
I don't know if the Zillions script uses this property of the
'plain' Y board, but if it does, it might make decent moves in
the endgame at least.

But this algorithm does not seem to carry over to "official" Y
or to Hex... :-(
