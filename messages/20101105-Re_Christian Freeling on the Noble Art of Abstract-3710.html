Ok guys, goodbye. I tried to get the focus on a game (any game but I
happened to be occupied with Symple). Apparantly few have even tried
to understand a new and interesting mechanism, focused as they are on
proving some point regarding Mark, of which they also claim that
anyone can see it. Why keep pointing it out then? It's a Pavlov
reaction and I don't discuss games with dogs.
