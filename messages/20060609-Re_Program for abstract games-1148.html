<br>I'm a big fan of Lua so it's always neat to stumble across something

<br>Thank you! This is the first time I used Lua, but it was a long time I
<br>wanted to.
<br>

<br>And this is a bad thing...

<br><blockquote type=cite>I have a PC with Windows XP (Home Edition) and Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I

<br>I don't have SP2, so it's a bit difficult to solve this problem. Since
<br>my program didn't crash, but it showed an empty frame, I think the
<br>problem must concern the graphics library I used: SDL. I saw in
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.libsdl.org">www.libsdl.org</a> that there's some conflict with SDL and SP2. I read
<br>there some solutions, which I've included in the code. I have
<br>recompiled, and you can download in
<br>nomignolov.blogspot.com
<br>from the right bar: "Nomv 06 temp version for WinXP SP2", or directly
<br>here:

<br>I really do not know what else I could do :-)
<br>
<br>Bye, Jean
