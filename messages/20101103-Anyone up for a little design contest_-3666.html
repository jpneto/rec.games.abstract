Inspired by the folks over at the board game design forum, who hold
monthly design contests (mostly for euroish games), I thought it might
be nice to have a little abstract game design competition, where
everyone tries to design a game featuring some mechanic or dynamic.
Perhaps we could get Nestor to agree to publish the result.

I thought it might help to productively channel the competitive juices
that seem to destroy conversation here.

let me know if you're interested.  If there's enough interest, I'll be
happy to organize it.
