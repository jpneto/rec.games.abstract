2) Not in love with the win condition. It's good in the sense that it
will probably create the right tensions, but I prefer win conditions
which are simple enough and visual enough that you know who won by
glancing at the board, without calculation. Hex and other simple
connection games are my ideal here. Ketchup's win condition works for
me only because it's possible to play with a scoring track, which
keeps each player's status visual, and even that skirts the edge of my
preferences.

So a question for me is: what simple, visual win condition is most
naturally paired with your supercool mechanism to produce a good
game?

Corey Clark has been trying for a loooooong time to create a
connection game with just the right amount of coldness in it, and it
occurs to me that your mechanism might be the ticket. So while the Hex
connection goal is horrifically unoriginal, combined with your
feedback mechanism it might solve Corey's problem and make an
exquisite game.

But ideally, I'd like to think of an original win condition which is
the natural conclusion to a game with your mechanism, and which is
also visual. Nothing's popping into my head. I'll think about it later
when I have more time.

A square board should be odd sized to prevent draws.
I think Nick the win condition in itself isn't problematic in this day
and age. It's easy to keep track of the score in an applet. Yet I feel
Nick has a point - an intuitive point - about the goal.
Despite the 2-3 moves per turn, this game has a slower pace than
Symple. However, it has ample opportunities for combinations because
it isn't bound to extending existing groups by one stone, so it
behaves more flexible in this respect.

Territory can be claimed much the same way as in Symple: you can't
'invade' if it requires a new group that can't grow enough to
compensate for its penalty. So basically its Symple at a slower pace
and slightly different tactics. If I had a sense of humor, I'd say the
slower pace gives you more time to count, but if you follow Nick's
intuition, there may be a far less tedious counting procedure at hand:
what if you added your own XYodd to the mix in terms of a connection
goal?
