Yes but then it was an insult based on your serial-killer appearance, now its been elevated to a truism.

You already said that, fool.  "I saved a secret weapon back in October."  And I already told you to go ahead and post it.  Now you're backpedaling like Christian Freeling with his "perfect balance" claims.  Holy shit you're a fool.

Well it doesn't say much that hasn't already been said now. There's no point in going to the trouble of posting this shit. You could probably deflect it with this ridiculous fabrication that stretches the limits of credulity. Except for the fact that your excuse stretches the limits of credulity. You've already hoisted yourself by your own petard, my job is done.

Oh no.  Corey Clark doesn't recognize my standing in rga.  Boo hoo  :(

Well I dunno Mark between the shitty releases and the half-assed political rhetoric and disruptive blog entries I think your standing was already in question. This whole thing about you finding 11 year old girls dressed as fairies sexually arousing is just about going to be the old nail in the coffin.

You started it, you fucking weasel.  And now you got a taste of your own medicine, you can't handle it.  Man up, little baby.

I'm handling it right now. handling it, handling it... Still handling it. I'll let you know when I've failed to handle it okay Mark? Some drunken internet comment on New Year's didn't have to spiral out of control into a massive mudslinging campaign. I can't help it if Bailey's and Eggnog is a fucking good drink.
