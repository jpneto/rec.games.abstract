Dots and Boxes starts by drawing a square grid of boxes. After that, players
alternate connecting dots (no diagonal lines). Whenever a square is
completed, the player that drew the final line claims that box with their
initials, and moves again. When all boxes have been claimed, the person with
the most boxes wins.

My only gripe against Dots and Boxes is relatively slow game opening. I
tinkered with the rules, looking for a fix. Quick Dots &amp; Boxes (QDB) is
played in the same way, but each player draws two lines per turn. The
instant that a player draws a third line on any box, their turn ends, and
play goes back to normal Dots and Boxes, with one line per turn. QDB is a
fairly deep game. I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the second player can always force a win on the
3x3 board. A book on Dots and Boxes was recently put out by Elwyn Berlekamp.

It was reviewed in Scientific American.
I discuss a notation for this game at

I've started a 3x3 game of QDB.  So far, the moves are:
1. B1|  C3|    .........   A2|  A3|
2. B4_ A3_

Already, it's a deep game.
