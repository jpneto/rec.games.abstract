Couple o' things here. We were past this forum wars business. See when
you seemed so upset that I was declining to enter the contest I had to
think about why you would be quite as upset as you were and I came to
the conclusion that it was you who hadn't moved past all this nonsense
seeing as you mentioned the "fudgepack" and all that when I was just
trying to explain that I'm having trouble keeping myself interested in
abstract games. My waning interest in abstract game design has been a
shitty experience for me as I was having some success in the field.
Now I'm drifting aimlessly like a dandelion spore. Okay enough poetry
lol. The second thing is I was never Bill Taylor's recruit, it was
just a coincidence that he was flaming the forum at the same time as
me. You have this whole Darth Vader, Emporer Palpatine dynamic in your
head about me and Bill Taylor, there's a whole lot less to it than
that. Bill Taylor didn't give me my impetus and I never took orders
from him...
