Well, here's my idea: if m=n&gt;1, play (2,2), leaving
oxx.x
.....
oxx.x
oxx.x
ooo.o for your opponent.

Then you can always play symmetrically to your opponent until he has
to make the last move.

Now, suppose m=2, n&gt;m.  Play (2,n); then, if your
opponent plays (1,n), repeat the same strategy; if he plays (2,x),
play (1,x-1) so as to repeat the same variety of position.

Hmmm.  I thought this was easier than it really is.  I think I could
win this game playing first, but it's hard to verbalize the winning
strategy.  However, it is pretty easy to prove that the first player
wins:  Suppose the move (m,n) for the first player does not win.
Then there must be some refuting move (i,j); but the play of (m,n)
followed by (i,j) must result in the same position as (m,n) alone;
thus, the move (i,j) wins for the first player.

Anyhow, back to work.
