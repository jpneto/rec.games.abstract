Some have tried, I think, but it hasn't taken off.

how about awarding each side a quarter of a point instead of half a

That could work, although I think draws may just be a fact of playing
solid chess, and it's like we're trying to goad people into making a
mistake. The problem really is the danger of losing. It doesn't
encourage risk and brilliancy.

I think there should be a way so that a draw is not enough, although
they will happen. I think the way to do that may be a bonus situation
where positions are compared, and the person who shouldn't win from
that position gets an advantage. It would be daredevil, flirting with
danger, but it would also be a challenge for perfection, resulting in
brilliant counterplay, even with a draw at hand.
