This is definitely not true.  The games which can be reduced to Nim

three lives per vertex is too arbitrary to call it perfect.)

It doesn't seem very arbitrary to me.  It has to be greater than 2 (or
else the game would be pointless) and less than 4 (so that the game
terminates).  How many integers are there in that range?

   Ummm...the game DOES terminate with 4 provided that with a new point on a
line the two new lines must appear on opposite sides.  Sounds odd, but it
works as a game.  It's called "Brussell Sprouts" (sp?) and instead of points
crosses are used so a game goes like:

  +          +        +        +          +
             |        |        |          |
             +        +        +-X      /-+-X
             |        |        | |     +  | |
  +    +     +   +    +-+-+    +-+-+    \-+-+-+

etc. Note that at the "X" and the leftmost "+" only one new line can be drawn
because the other growth possibility has no point to connect to without
crossing a line.
   So, with some modifications it can be said that there are at least TWO
integers in that range.  I do agree, however, that calling Sprouts "imperfect"
because of the three rule is stupid; you could state with equal validity that
ANY game is imperfect since ALL games have limits of some sort.  Traxx, for
example, could be said to be arbitrary in it's restriction to two dimensions.
Or Nim could be called arbitrary in its two level hierarchy (piles of stones).
