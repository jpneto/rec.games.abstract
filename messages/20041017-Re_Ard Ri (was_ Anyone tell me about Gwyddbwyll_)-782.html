Quoting Chas's message of Yesterday:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I'm afraid I haven't found any historic references to it either. Was it
Parlett who said something that there were "vague" Scottish references
to Ard Ri?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, but I remember the comment you're referring to.  It's on Some Web
Page Somewhere, which I revisited recently, but can't find now.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It seems me one of them describes Ard Ri as a version where
the king must reach a corner to win, as opposed to just reaching the
edge of the board?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In David Parlett's book, the corner squares are marked, as on other
boards where the king's objective is the corner.  In the version on
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~leif/games/Hnefetafl/">http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~leif/games/Hnefetafl/</a> the king has to reach
the edge, though.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
How large a grid board and which layout are you describing below?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sorry, I should have mentioned the size.  Ard ri is associated with the
7x7 board.  The layout has the king in the centre with the defenders
around him forming a 3x3 grid.  The attackers are arranged in four
T-shapes around the edges, as in tablut.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And are you playing that the king has to reach the edge, or must reach
a corner?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

At the moment, it's not really relevant.  If the pieces have the rook's
move then the king won't get anywhere near either.  But the web page
above at caltech.edu has the king trying to reach the edge.
