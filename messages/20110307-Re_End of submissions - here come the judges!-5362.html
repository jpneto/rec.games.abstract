Because of, but not limited to, this kind of shit:

You didn't read the discussion, Alex, and you're not fooling anyone who has
read the discussion.  Waxing authoritative in a discussion you haven't read
identifies you as Bill Taylor or Harald Korneliussen, not as someone with
judge qualifications.

Mark, would you be so kind as to give me a direct quote from this
thread stating that the contest would be judged purely on quality of
play, and not at all on relevance.  I have not seen it on this thread,
and i have now read every post in the thread 3 times looking for it.
Since this is the only specific reason you gave for protesting my
application, i would at least like to see what you are referencing
that puts me in error.

Also, i ask, if for example Larry Wheeler (just chose a random name
from the list) had objected to the 2 judges you currently had, would
you call off the judging until a judge could be found that everyone
agreed on?  what if he objected to every judge?
