This is clearly very different from the other game. I don't know if I
like it as much, since there are an infinite (but countable) number of
distinct guesses between the lower bound and any other guess. The
"second smallest" rule does little to clarify what a winning strategy
might be. There's too much freedom in the guessing to allow for mind
games, like you could imagine in version 1, where we had integers &gt;= 1.
There you could think things like "I'll guess 1 because no one else
will. but wait, what if someone else thinks this? I won't guess 1. What
if everyone else is thinking this? Maybe I should guess 1. then again,
maybe I should guess 2." and so on.

I'd like to see another version of game 1 played, since the capacity
for mind games probably won't diminish until about the 100 game mark,
as long as the results are always published after each game.

After saying all of this, I'm still interested in seeing what the
winer is...... :-)

also: I'm not sure about the original post, but if we were allowed to
send in algorithms which could refer to the results of all other
algorithms sent it, this might be more interesting. On the other hand,
then nobody would win, because the algorithms would probably get stuck
in an infinite loop.
