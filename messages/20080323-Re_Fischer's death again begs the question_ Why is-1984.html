Decisiveness can increase interest even with no understanding of the

Here they do. Even in the absence of real time suspense, or stunning
visuals, people like to follow results. None of the sports covered
in our newspapers have the characteristics that 60% of encounters
end in ties, with a significant number of those occurring without
even playing, though.

Yes and none of them have the property that they can only be fully
understood by people who have studied the sport since childhood to the
near exclusion of all else.  Perhaps <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and not the high
proportion of draws, is the reason why the game doesn't command huge
reports in the newspapers?

It's especially offensive that this [uncontested draws] occurs in

Many sports organise their major competitions as KO events, which
puts a different complexion on things.  In leagues, it is very
common in the sports I know anything about for end-of-season
matches to be meaningless -- almost all issues of promotion or
relegation are decided, and most teams just go through the motions.
Why would you expect chess tournaments to be different?  If you've
just had 10 days of gruelling mental activity, it's not surprising
if on the 11th, with nothing at stake, you don't want to take it
too seriously.  Even if there is still something at stake, you may
be in no mood to put yet another six+ hours of thought into it.
Been there, done that.

No, he isn't.  There is often nothing to play for in the last round or
two of a round-robin tournament (or `league' as they're called in most
sports).  The team that always wins has an unassailable position at
the top of the table; the crap team that always loses has an
irretrievable position at the bottom of the table.  All that's to play
for is the occasional minor distinction in the middle of the table.

Players who have a chance of winning the tournament generally attempt
to do so in the last round.
