Whenever you allow an opponent to capture a piece, with the knowledge
that you can immediately recapture the opposing piece and thus
re-equalize the material balance, you have made a "sacrifice": you have
traded a material disadvantage (after the opponent's capture, you have
less material than the opponent) for a positional advantage (your
position is actually better than the material balance would suggest,
because you have the immediate opportunity to capture an opposing piece
which is not adequately defended).

The only difference between one sound "sacrifice", and another, is how
long it takes before the material balance is restored.  In some cases
it's only 1 ply, in other cases it might be 10 ply, in other cases it
might be 40 ply.  It has to happen eventually, if the sacrifice is
sound.

A big reason why Deep Blue won is that due to faster hardware, it was
able to search deeper into the position than ever before.  The
available data consistently shows that the ELO rating of a given
computer program increases linearly with the depth of the search.
Another reason for the loss is Kasparov's inadequate preparation, due
at least in part if not in whole to the fact that there were no public
games between Deep Blue and other grandmasters.  If there had been
some games, Kasparov would have had a more accurate idea of what to
expect and he could have studied the games looking for weaknesses in
Deep Blue's play that he could exploit.  Also, the programming team
spoke tantalizingly about some secret algorithms that have never been
make public.  It's impossible to say what effect they had. Blah Blah
Blah Blah ....
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This all seems true, but overriding all of this is the self-evident fact
that Kasparov had a mental breakdown which causes him to blunder away
the decisive game.  If in his normal competitive mental state, he might
have won the match, or might have tied the match, but would have been
very unlikely to lose the last game.

Anyway, this is all beside the point; the reasons for Deep Blue's
victory have nothing to do with my statement about strategic
sacrifices.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The primary reason for Deep Blue's victory is that Kasparov had a false
perspective on what to expect from Deep Blue as an opponent, and how to
prepare to play against it.  A perspective that seems very similar to
the one you stated---whether or not this is what you meant.
