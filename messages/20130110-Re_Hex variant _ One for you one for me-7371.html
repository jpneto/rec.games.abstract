Unfortunately for Hazen, almost no programmers are adding new games to their servers now.  I've already warned those who might remotely consider implementing Hazen's game what a douche he is, providing links to his rants here at r.g.a.  They've all firmly committed to never programming Hazen's games..  They don't want trouble from a raving lunatic who will threaten them and demand that they keep pace with his endless game tweaks.

Good luck, Hazen.  That's what you get for being a douche.
