What is you definitive answer to my post : is Connecticut a twisted Twixt? yes or no.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, if anything its an UNtwisted twixt. someone with a keen design sensibility like myself doesn't need to refer to Twixt to design something like Connecticut. I routinely expunge Twixt from my memory every time it reasserts itself there because regardless of how popular it is, its slightly more interesting than the garbage that sporadically ejects from the wheelhouse of Hazen Abouricha. Its not worthy of my consideration and if someone wants to call it a plagiarism of Twixt that presupposes that I care if Twixt is trounced upon in the first place and no I don't. I don't care, so the conversation is over.

I would be trying to intimidate you if routinely exposing you as a complete moron and all around god-awful human being was not already exceedingly easy to do. Intimidate you? You arrogant prick, there is no need to intimidate you. I am the authority on abstract game design here.

I can understand that a perfect information game is completely mathematically analyzable. Read Winning Ways, you retarded frog. 

YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT DESIGNING ABSTRACT GAMES SOMSHUT UP!
