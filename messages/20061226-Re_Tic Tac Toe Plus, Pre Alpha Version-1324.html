Can I make a suggestion up front, without having seen the software?
You guys need a real name, like Red Dragon Video Games, or Omniware, or
Mtoshima Video Games.  Something.  Anything.  Makers of Video Games
sounds like something poorly translated from Chinese.  It's so plain
vanilla that . . . no, vanilla is a flavor.  It's more like plain tofu.
 It sends the message "We're so non-creative that we're afraid to
actually design a name for ourselves.  So instead we're just going to
use this placeholder-in-lieu-of-a-name, Makers of Video Games."  Naming
your company is an opportunity to convey creativity, not an obstacle to
be avoided.  Your current name only says what you are, not who you are.
 There's also the trademark issue.  You can't trademark something that
generic.

The pre-alpha version of Tic Tac Toe Plus, which is actually a Tic Tac
Toe game, will be made available on Wed 27th.

Your contribution is needed and will be appreciated as we would like
persons to sample this version of the game and give their honest

good idea that will be splendid for the game.

This version is only a pre-alpha version, it is not a completed game,
therefore do not expect mush visuals, options or gameplay as a matter
of fact.
