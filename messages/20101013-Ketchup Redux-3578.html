It was discovered that my game Ketchup, as originally conceived, has a
big first mover advantage, and that this ignominious problem grows
worse on large boards (which is unusual).  Luckily, there's a natural
fix, which results in a finely balanced game which might be better
than the original.

The fix is: the asymmetric move rules don't kick in until someone has
formed a group of at least 2 stones.  That is to say: the 12* move
rule is in place until a group of at least 2 is formed, and from then
on the player with the largest group plays 2 stones on the player
without the largest group plays three.

So I'm writing to post the new rules here, and to note that the ig
game center, where Ketchup can be played online, has been updated to
reflect the modification
