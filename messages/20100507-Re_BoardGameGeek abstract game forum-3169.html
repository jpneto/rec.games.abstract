Rich, Iago is not a metagame.  You are not admired by anyone, with the

I'm not sure I even know Rich, so don't know upon what you're basing 
that assertion. One might say that I do generally admire anyone who's 
contributed to the field of promoting the playing of games of skill, 
specifically for those contributions. Heavens, I even admire your 
actual contributions, despite the fact that as a human being you are 
intollerable.

However, I do know why you made that assertion. You simply made it to 
elicit a response from me. Which makes you a troll as well as a crank. 

You may tally one bite. It will be your last.

I think we need to see a little more deference out of you, Iago man,
and a little less blustering.

Quoth Captain spittle-laced bluster.
