|&gt; &gt;Currently, the limit of (overnight by a PC) Othello perfect-play
|&gt; &gt;analysis is within the range of the last 26-28 moves of the game.
|&gt; &gt;The 6 x 6 game has only 32 moves (31 actually since the first move
|&gt; &gt;is determined WRT symmetry) and each player has fewer options to
|&gt; &gt;consider per move (as compared to an 8 x 8 game).  So SURELY the
|&gt; &gt;6 x 6 game has ALREADY been solved... 
|&gt;   Some other interesting and solvable variations on Othello are:
|&gt;     1) 4x4 Othello
|&gt;     2) 'Reverse' othello - player with the fewest disks at the end of
|&gt; 	the game wins. This could be a viable 4x4 or 6x6 game
|&gt;     3) A variation on othello where the 'flipping' rule is changed.
|&gt;        Instead of just flipping pieces between the just-played piece
|&gt;        and similarly colored pieces, also flip any other pieces that
|&gt;        are between similarly colored pieces as a result of the first
|&gt;        series of flips.
|&gt;     4) This just popped into my head as I'm typing - but what about
|&gt;        a semi-Othello-like game where 1) Players can place pieces
|&gt;        anywhere, and 2) A newly placed piece flips all of the existing
|&gt;        pieces in the same row or column (regardless of color). Hmmmm,
|&gt;        I'll have to get out my board and see if it's viable.
|&gt; 

That's interesting, it looks as though there is an entire class of
othello-like games, which generalizes othello in the same way that
my class symmetric chess-like games generalizes chess and checkers. 
Does anyone want to try to define this class, and possibly produce a
generator for it?  One interesting consequence would be the need to
produce a more general evaluation function:  How might we generalize
features like STABILITY to apply to different sets of rules? 

|&gt;   Also, a general question for the group:
|&gt; 
|&gt;   I have a semi-general minimax program that I use (sometimes) to analyze
|&gt;   games that I have an interest in. It occurs to me that other people have
|&gt;   this as well, and if they do, that their programs are probably better
|&gt;   written than mine. This could be useful information to exchange for those
|&gt;   who are unable to run Barney Pell's (hope I got the name right!) Metagame
|&gt;   workbench.

There is also the Smart Game Board by Anders Kierulf, now supported I
believe by Martin Muller (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mueller@inf.ethz.ch">mueller@inf.ethz.ch</a>), but sadly this only
runs on Macs.  However, Kierulf's phd thesis may give you some ideas
on how to make a useful general minimax engine.   

What interesting games have you analyzed?
