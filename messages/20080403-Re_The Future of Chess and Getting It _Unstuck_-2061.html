Why would you assume that?

I love all sorts of variants, some more than others.  That doesn't
mean that chess needs fixing.  Chess is just fine the way it is.

I don't think that liking the 50-yard dash implies that marathons 
are broken, I don't think that likeing deep-sea fishing means that 
fly fishing is broken, and I don't think that liking chess variations
means that chess is broken.

Do you see that variants are useful

Useful for what purpose?  I see that some of them are fun to play,
and that's enough for me.

Either produce actual evidence showing that those who disagree
with you do so for religious reasons, or drop the constant
accusations that they do.  The above is simply a cheap shot
debating trick.  More light, less heat, please.
