Getting tired of stone placement games and connection games.  Granted, I have
plenty of each, and stone placement is ideal in a sense, but I'd like to see for
example cocktail napkin games.  I.e., you're on a flight, you've got a cocktail
napkin and one pen (or two pens of one color).  What do you play?  You could
play Scribe if you both have the glyphs memorized.

I worked on that problem for quite a while, and came up with two games that I haven't been able to test very thoroughly, but seem interesting:
A3G <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://xifeng.posterous.com/a3g">http://xifeng.posterous.com/a3g</a>
and Yusailo, <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://xifeng.posterous.com/new-game-yusailo">http://xifeng.posterous.com/new-game-yusailo</a>

Yusailo has been driving me nuts, I keep thinking it must be completely broken, but every time I think I've broken it, I find some counter-strategy.

So for now I think Sprouts is easy enough to explain. The strategy is a nightmare though.
