I was just kicked off of the forum here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking_games/">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/stacking_games/</a>

....for reacting to criticism of myself.  I regretfully didn't copy the
whole post, but it ends with:

Moderator: ... and the initiator seems to be too weak to resist
Steere's domination.

Me (denied posting):  are you a dick in real life or just online?

Moderator (via email):  criticism is ok, abusive languague isn't

Me (trying to log in): "what? but I'm logged into yahoo, why can't I
check the forum? oh haha.  I already got 86'd."

Me (now at r.g.a.):  Just thought I'd share here since there's a
distasteful, non constructive post about me in a place that I have no
access to anymore.  Somehow on a forum where it's ok to call someone
"weak" it's not ok to call someone a "dick". I'm baffled at the double
standard.
