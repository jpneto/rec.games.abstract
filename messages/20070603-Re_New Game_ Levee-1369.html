I was trying to demonstrate two things in my PDF file.  First of all,
I'm answering the question, "Is it possible for Player 1 to win simply
by filling in all of Player 2's edge points?"  I think we can all
agree that the abundantly obvious answer to that is no.

The second thing I was trying to demonstrate is that the obvious
counter-strategy to the edge-fill strategy is only slightly more
sophisticated than the edge-fill strategy.  I think it's safe to
assume that a strategy to foil the strategy that foils the edge-fill
strategy would be more complex yet.  Simply because the counter-
counter-counters start piling up, it starts to get a little
complicated.  More of a guess than a fact though.  There could be a
kink in my theory, but only time will tell.

The only thing that would demonstrate is that I'm a lousy game
player.  I'll concede that up front.  Now on a 9x9 there's probably
going to be a first move advantage, even among beginners.  I've only
played one complete game: a 9x9 against myself.  But I've started a
couple of 19x19 games on superdupergames.org, one of which I'm quickly
losing, as anticipated.

Well you could try out the edge strategy yourself, and maybe you'll start
winning! :)

Obviously you don't play randomly on the opponents edge - you just "squint"
at the opponents stones and think "Is he starting to bunch up his stones to
present a focussed threat to force a channel to a particular point (or
general area) on his edge?".  If so, play your stone at or near that
point...  It seems to take <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more moves to build up a channel threat
like this, compared to responding to block it.  On the other hand, if the
opponent plays unfocussed moves dotted around the board, simply reply on the
opponents edge roughly parallel with the played stone (on the same side of
the board).  (I.e. maintaining an overall "balanced" position.)

I tried out a couple of 19x19 games against myself, but if anything the size
seemed to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>help<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the edge strategy.  It seems that playing further away from
the centre actually helps with the blocking strategy, as you have more time
to see a threat coming!

One thing I did notice - the most troubling counter-strategy I found
involved playing moves on the diagonals - these moves are connected, and can
end up threatening to direct a super-wide channel to one of the opponents
entire edges.  If you've been playing too many moves on the opposite edge,
you could be caught out by this, although it doesn't seem to be a problem if
you keep a balance between your moves and your opponents as I described
above...

E.g.
   . . . . . . . . .
   O . . . . . . # O
   O . . . . # . . .
   . . . . # . . . .
   O . . a * c . . .
   . . . . b # . . O
   . . . . . . # . .
   O . . . . . . # O
   . . . . . . . . .

O has carelessly played too many moves on the left, given the number of
moves # has made on the right.  If # can get to play a and b, O won't be
able to block the edge fast enough.  (But even at this point O can easily
win by temporarily abandoning the edge strategy to block at c...)

Let's keep our fingers crossed.  I only develop games that seem
architecturally interesting to me.  It rarely happens that they
develop flaws.  Somewhat more commonly, though still infrequently,
they turn out to be not fun to play.  I don't really have any control
over that.  If they work, and they seem pretty cool, I release them.

Well, most of these sorts of games I never look into at all, so I fully
agree with you this one sounds interesting.  It would be a shame if it turns
out to be unbalanced for some reason.

Hmmm, superdupergames.org?  I've not come across that before - I'll have to
investigate it...!
