A kind of "interleaved combs" shape. Even allowing filled in loops wouldn't fix this. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

One of the combs would be an odd number of cells larger than the other.  If the combs each spanned half of the perimeter cells, their size difference would break the tie.

It is where both players always have the same type of moves available to them. So in this case it would be the ability to place either side's color with each move. Games like Yodd and Produto are good examples.

I think Flume, with a superficial similarity to Dots and Boxes, might fit that description.

I think every designer should have an impartial play game. But, that being said, I'm kind of biased against impartiality.  Somehow each player only having access to stones of his own color is more aesthetic, at least to me, though this is not a criticism of Yodd, etc.

I also really appreciate Atoll, and Cephalopod seems pretty cool as well. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Atoll is liked by a small percentage of players, and Cephalopod by an even smaller percentage.  Most of the feedback on Cephalopod has been negative.  On the other hand, Cephalopod is my most programmed and most played game.  Kind of a paradox. Hex Oust is the only one that has attained kind of a reverence.

I was thinking about how the "ring" win-condition in Havannah would be super drawish on its own, ...

Beware.  Christian Freeling is always watching.  Right now he's struggling with an irresistible urge to leap to the defense of his precious Havannah, but hopefully he can restrain himself.

Technically, you could say Hex and Y are Loops variants where one player is guaranteed to get 100% of the territory :)
