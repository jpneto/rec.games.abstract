For example, Mr. Freeling is well known at Little Golem and if he tried to promote Konobi there then it would mean something. Or at least he could implement Konobi at his own site. Therefore I addressed the problems he raised in his post. I know that he thinks rather highly of Slither and my  impression was that the initial difficulties in learning Konobi are rather similar to those of Slither while Konobi offers static connections which is a big plus. And I also congratulated the author in order to "promote" his further work as a designer. I was very impressed by his earlier XOdd and now by this game. What I especially like is that his games can be played on small Go boards, have deep gameplay and are not simple modifications of existing games.

Those who care to read what I actually posted will notice that I voiced some doubt regarding clarity, framed between "I don't know, Luis" and "I may be wrong".

This doesn't translate in anyone but Mark's opinion in "inaccessible". Actually I'm a bit sensitive to placement restrictions because Mark's frequent use of it. But not enough to not mentioning that apparent lack of clarity as perceived initially, can be overcome in the long run, in particular in a 'placement only' game.

I gave an initial impression, please don't consider it a final one. I don't know who goes behind the nick, don't care for nicknames anyway, but I agree with you in every respect regarding Luis' work and his approach to game inventing.
