I'm certainly not going to ban him because he thought the corners
being excluded as part of the adjoining edges was "ugly". The most I
can do is defend Havannah and tell him that I disagree. I'm doing my
part to keep the peace there but please let's not have this escalate.
I certainly wouldn't call it a deal breaker that Bill Taylor doesn't
fully appreciate Havannah.

You're right, retard Clark.  The fact that Bill Taylor doesn't fully
appreciate Havannah is not, in itself, a deal breaker.  If Bill Taylor had
gotten to know Christian a little better, and then at some appropriate time
revealed his feelings about Havannah in a sensitive manner, no problem.

Here's the deal breaker, retard Clark.  YOU DON'T WELCOME AN INDUSTRY LEGEND
TO YOUR GROUP FOR THE FIRST TIME BY SAYING "HI! I'M BILL TAYLOR! YOUR GAME
IS UGLY!"  You think Belligerent Bill's "ugly" comment was a coincidence?? 
Boy, you don't know Bill Taylor very well.

Bill Taylor has gone out of his way to insult the entire abstract game
industry.  The designers, the programmers, the players... all the people who
are wasting their time not fawning over Bill Taylor.  Bill, we'd love to
fawn over you but you've got to give us a reason.  Slime Trail is not a
reason.  Slime Trail is... just a slime trail.
