*** RUMBO ***

INTRODUCTION

Rumbo is a territory game for two players: Vertical and Horizontal. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of stones in two colors.

The four orthogonal adjacencies of a point are named after the cardinal points. Vertical owns the north and south directions, the pairs north-east and south-west and the triplets north-south-east and north-south-west; Horizontal owns the east and west directions, the pairs north-west and south-east and the triplets east-west-north and east-west-south.

DEFINITIONS

In these rules, "adjacent" always means "orthogonally adjacent".

A group is a maximal set of orthogonally connected, like-colored stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.

A liberty of a group is an empty point adjacent to it.

A hole is an empty point adjacent to four stones of the same color.

To claim a group is to mark it as yours, e.g. by placing a marker of yours on top of one of its stones.

PLAY

Vertical plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must place one stone of any color on an empty point and fill all resulting holes with stones of the same color. Then, each unclaimed group without liberties is claimed by the player who owns the set of adjacencies of stones in that group to the first stone placed on that turn.

The game ends when the board is full. A player's score is the sum of the sizes of the groups that they own, plus a komi in the case of Horizontal. The player with the highest score wins.

KOMI

The komi is the number of points which is added to Horizontal's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. To avoid ties, the parity of komi should be different from the parity of the board size.
