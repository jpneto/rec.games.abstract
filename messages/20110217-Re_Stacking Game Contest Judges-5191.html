I will continue working on the set of games that I have started and
bring them to completion.  I hope in the process, I haven't slighted
anyone's game, my goal is to help facilitate the contest by making as
many games as possible available.  Unfortunately, 100% coverage is not
possible, but I believe that in this case, something is better than
nothing.

Greg, I'm sure I speak for all when I say your efforts are highly
appreciated and have contributed tremendously to bring an ad hoc
contest to the point where it is, which is certainly already farther
than I had dared to hope for. If it becomes the succes we may now
expect it to be, it will be to a large degree thanks to you :)
