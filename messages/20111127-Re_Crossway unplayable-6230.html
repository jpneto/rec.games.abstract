May I see an example game between two 'highly intelligent Crossway
players'? I would like very much to change my mind about Crossway
(given that I would like to see a good connection game on a standard
19x19 Go board) and a high level example game with commentary would go
a long way towards this end. As I mentioned in my other comments
example games and hints about tactics and strategy are an essential
part of responsible game design. There are none on your website.
Unless you can supply the evidence of of the existence of such players
and such games I take it you are just trolling. The game sites which
support Crossway have no indication of any activity around this game.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed, if the beginners cannot figure out how to stop an advancing
chain it will take just 19 Ninja-like moves to finish the game. I hope
you enjoy doing this. I don't. According to my analysis 7 lines of a
buffer space are needed to stop the advance of the first player after
his first move. This means that the initial advance starting from the
middle almost ends on the edge of the board. If anything, this game is
not particularly suitable for 19x19 goban. And why bother if Slither
can be played on 13x13? The problem is with too many degrees of
freedom of chain extension and weak blocking mechanism. Anyway I look
forward to seeing the example games (without much hopes though).

You're entitled to a full refund.

Rush is not my best game.  But Crossway is among my very best.  Nay, not my
