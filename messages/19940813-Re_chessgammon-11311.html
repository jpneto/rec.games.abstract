There are three interesting questions:
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The first three have been covered in a previous post.  The fourth is tough.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 1: In chess, you may only capture en passant on the first move after the
    opponent's pawn moved.  Is this rule relaxed to allow you to wait until
    you next roll an ace?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nope.  Next roll only.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 2: as Thomas Hayes asks: can you capture en passant a pawn that made a double
    move [rather than a two-square single move]
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nope.  Has to be the result of the two-move priveledge.

 3: generalizing 2:

     White's pawn is on E5.  Black rolls 11 and plays D7-D5-D4.  White rolls
     1X; perhaps we can let him move E5-D6*?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yup, this was Example 2.  The capture is possible because the two pawn
moves are considered to be simultaneous with respect to en passant.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 4: If white moves a pawn two cells and puts a real piece behind the pawn can
    Black capture both?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
     White has a pawn on E5.  Black rolls 12 and plays pawn D7-D5 and N-D6.
     Can white play E5-D6** and gobble up both?  Can he play E5-D6* and take
     only the knight
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yikes!  I hadn't considered this possibility at all.  Ugh.  Good question.

Hmmm...  I guess there are a few reasonable options.  Here are some ideas
that I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>don't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> like.  We could forbid the en passant capture in this one
case, but that is inconsistent.  We could change the en passant rules
entirely, to take order of moves into account, but that would virtually
eliminate en passant situations.  We could take out the en passant rule
entirely, which some purists may prefer anyway.

My ruling (not that I have any authority in the matter) is that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
pieces can be captured with the single pawn move.  In the example above,
White would play e5xd6 and capture both the knight (directly) and the
pawn (by en passant).

The justification for this rule is that, in some sense, both pieces
occupy the d6 square.  The pawn is on that square in a virtual sense,
just as it is in any en passant situation, while the knight is on that
square in the physical sense.

PS I won't be able to answer questions over the next week, as I am on
   vacation.  Keep playing, and have fun!
