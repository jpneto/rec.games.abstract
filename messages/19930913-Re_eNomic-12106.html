    &gt; Lars Clausen told me that you were running a Nomic-like game
    &gt; called Senator.  Could you tell me about it please?

    Sure. It's a bit like Nomic, but it starts off with less rules.
    Essentially, there are a bunch of people who vote on proposals
    made by the players, and if a proposal passes, it goes into rule.

    That's the whole basis of it. We've been going for a few months
    now, and have a good number of rules, and an interesting dynamic
    as well.  Are you interested in joining? If so, mail me a
    description as to why you would want to join, and I'll post it for
    the Senators to read.  Then, they'll have a vote as to whether or
    not you can join.

    Thanks for the interest.
