I think that one can always go 'outside the system' and come up with a

A large, but poorly-defined finite set, therefore, can behave for
practical purposes as if it had properties that, in an exact
mathematical sense, can only apply to a set with at least aleph-one
elements. This doesn't defy any law of mathematics (and, indeed, due
to the subject matter, I've pulled sci.math back in, since it's
relevant now).

So, then, to make this more mathematical, are the number of rules
variants for a game like chess an Aleph of any sort?  I will re: this
topic to have it ask that.  Maybe someone else who is more math(y) in
their knowledge could frame this in a more mathematically proper form.

It is relatively simple to come up with an infinite number of
variants.
Consider that in standard chess the king can be captured by a single
attack.  Consider a variant where the king can only be captured by
two attacks.   This generalizes to 3,4,...,n,... attacks.

(Actually, Simon Smith's argument above falls a bit short.  It is
not enough to show there are an infinite number of descriptions
of variants of Calvinball chess (after all for each variant there
are an infinite number of descriptions))
