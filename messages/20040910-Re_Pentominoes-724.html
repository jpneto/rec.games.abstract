One of my favourite games has long been the two-player version of Pentominoes, whereby each 
plays in turn and the one who can't play loses. My problem with it is that there's not much to 
think about in the first few moves and you might as well play more or less at random until the 
position begins to crystallise, usually after about five moves. Over the years I've 
experimented with various ways of overcoming this problem, and have recently come up with a 
version in which you do actually have to start thinking right from the first move. Before 
sharing this with you, if anyone is interested, I have a question. Can anyone advise me as to 
a cheap and foolproof way of making sets of pentominoes that are accurate and dimensionally 
stable, based on squares of about 25 mm each? Cutting them out of balsa wood or thick 
cardboard is not 100 per cent reliable - at least, not in my hands.

You can buy a set of pentominoes from many manufacturers. In Japan I
found a very nice set made of wood. In Germany, there were also nice
sets of plastic, together with many puzzles (tiling) with the
pentominoes set.

By the way, the game on an 8x8 board where players move alternately
and the one who can not move loses is solved (as a win for the first
player). I can provide a reference if you are interested.
