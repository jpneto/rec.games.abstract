(Somewhat) guilty as charged.  I needed a lead-in for an essentially off
topic discussion.  But....  you do see a lot of Christian symbols alongside
abstract game symbols on bgg.  And....  there's Aaron and a bunch of other
game programmers who are big into Christianity.  People I shouldn't piss off

I have zero experience of most of the other places where abstract
gamers congregate, if that's the right word. Only a few times have
my strident atheistic hackles, and many others', been puffed up on 
the only site I frequent.

Imagery-wise, you may have a point. The only people I know who have
had fancy-ass (marble/jade/ivory etc.) decorative chess sets have 
all been pro-monarchy godsquad. So the symbolism may actually reflect
something.

What a quirky detour.
