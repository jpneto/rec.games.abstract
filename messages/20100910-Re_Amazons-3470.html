As for Rush.. Mark, you said a couple of times that Rush was
implemented on igGC though it was "non-recommended". I just checked
our correspondence: it was you who offered me to implement Rush back
in Feb-2008 because some other site "after nine months of delays,
they've reneged on their promise to program it".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Quite correct, Arty.  I got my wires crossed.  After you programmed
Rush I started to realize it wasn't too good and I recommended against
it to Wes (games.wtanaka.com) who went ahead and programmed it anyway.

As for "PC", Mark, we haven't had any conflicts. I've been trying hard
to avoid any conflicts with anyone.

And there's no reason why you should have conflicts.  Conflicts is my
department.  I like conflicts.

But
using igGC as a "tool" in your war against Arimaa's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>fans<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> on the
Arimaa site would certainly provoke kind of "understating" igGC in one
form or another. What did you expect, Mark? That they would agree with
you? Fans of Arimaa would agree with your example of igGC's
statistics? No they wouldn't. And they didn't. It was clear from the
beginning that igGC's statistics will be devalued. Now, tell me,
should I be happy with that?

Yes, it was a jackass stunt that opened up IGGC to a powder puff
snub.  So what?  It was not diabolical.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Yeah, I can evaluate the igGC's activity adequately: it's not that active site.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Arty, stop beating up on yourself.  IGGC is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>huge<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for a real time
site.  You easily achieved "critical mass" in a couple short years,
something Boardspace has been "on the verge of" for the past decade.
I.e. when you want to start a game at IGGC there are people there to
play against.  You don't have to play a fucking bot.

If there's a real time game site that's better than IGGC, tell me
now.  I need to go there and talk to them about Cage.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And that's something I want to
change. Now tell me, what kind of comments help to improve activity:
"cool site, lots of games, serious players" or "not an active site,
secondary road near a village". Aha?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you want ensure the best possible image for IGGC, just keep doing
what you're doing - building a great site with great games.  Don't
become consumed with your image to the extent of monitoring discussion
on the Internet.  That seems like a control issue to me.  People will
form their own opinions independently, intelligently - not based on an
offhanded remark some random zero said.  Welcome to Earth, 2010.
Nobody has a perfect image.  The Pope had a perfect image, but now
he's the guy who institutionalized molestation cover-up.
