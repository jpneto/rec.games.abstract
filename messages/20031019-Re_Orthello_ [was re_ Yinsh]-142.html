Off the top of my head, the corner and edge squares would retain most
of their usual importance.

ObFollowup:  What would Othello be like if you could only flip pieces
diagonally, but not orthogonally; and if the starting arrangement were
changed from

    WB
    BW

(which would result in neither player having a move) to

    WW

After two turns you would have

     B
      BW
      WB
     W

And both players would be congratulating each other on another draw ;)
More sensibly, if you added more fixes, you'd still be left with two
simultanious games which didn't interact with each other.  And you'd
probably want to put the two games onto separate boards in order to
stop getting too confused.

Hmm, good point-- Bishop Othello is isomorphic with Rook Othello on a
suitably shaped board:

        ..
       ....
      ......
     ........
      ......
       ....
        ..

Analysis of Knight Othello is left as an exercise for the student.
