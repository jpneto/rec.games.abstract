I will look over Parlett's book if I can.  The categories were based
off of the way Zillions site categorizes it.  The reason for the
categorization is mostly for tournament play.  It is useful for
determining champions of classes of games, but also if you wanted to
have a range of games, Athlons, then you want a representative game of
each type.

That seems like a pretty good reason for the "why", but moving on to the
"what", I'd further question the degree of detail.  The definition of
the NULL non-board area, for example, seems a bit like more information
than needed.  Can you envisage having a tournament class of "Games with
multiple queue NULL features", for example?  If you can, then fine, but
if not it's just something to put people off... "I just wanted to play
checkers, and this leaflet goes on about all kinds of weird shit I've
never heard of, I think these guys are way beyond my league, best leave
'em to it!"

Also, the idea of the names is to give better
sounding names for people who play tournaments for games.  For
example, the chess variants site, is having a chess variants
championship.  Calling such games "Royal Elimination" sounds better
and more professional and serious than calling them "Chess Variants".
Doing this helps to get recognition.

Though OTOH it may obfuscate recognition.  Tell me "chess variants" and
I know what you're talking about.  Tell me there's a "Royal Elimination"
tournament and I'll have to get into the small print to know what on
earth is going on, but lots of folk never get into the small print.
