Well, I don't know whether it was just hype or real popularity.  But the fact
that there are pictures of celebrities playing the game is not evidence for
real popularity.  That could have just been a typical publicity stunt,
requiring nothing more than cash to set it up.

Sure, the tournament was sponsored for publicity reasons. Nevertheless, the
fact that these celebrities agreed to participate also means that they thought
the game is worth to be "related" with their names. Your view is rather
superficial. Do you think that all people are prostitutes who do ANYTHING for
money? These celebrities were rich and didn't need any $$.

I didn't say this <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>was<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a publicity stunt.  I said it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have been.
And no, I don't think that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> people would do anything for money, once
they have enough.  But there certainly are plenty who will.

The celebrity photo is consistent with the theory that Teeko was a game
enjoyed by millions of players worldwide over the course of five centuries.
The confused look on Judy Holliday's face might be because Scarne was such a
great player, and he made a brilliant move she wasn't expecting.

The celebrity photo is also consistent with the theory that Scarne just
showed up at the club one night and asked the celebrities to do him a favor.
After all, he had some degree of celebrity himself.  The confused look on
Judy Holliday's face might be because she had never seen the game before.

My point is, and was, that you can't tell anything about about which theory
is true from the photo.  The photo isn't evidence of anything about the
popularity of the game.

You may well be right, that Teeko was a very popular game.  I'm just saying
that I haven't seen much evidence to support that claim.

One of them looks like Judy Holliday.  Another might be Walter Slezak, I
think.  I don't recognize any of the others.  But that's not saying much.

Why do you not simply read the names below the picture. The names are

Oooops.  That was off the bottom of my browser window.  Hey, at least I got
two of them right.  The only other one I think I should have noticed was
Steve Allen, but he's kind of off in the distance with his head turned.  The
other names aren't familiar to me.
