How can I reduce analysis paralysis,
without removing what I regard to be the defining element of the game,
which is that your score depends on how many letters your word shares
with your opponent's most recently played word (see rules below).

Anyway, I'm hoping that by raising the issue here, one of you guys
will have something in your bag of tricks that will simplify the
game.  Here are the current rules:


1.  It's played on two side-by-side grids, each 9 cells wide

2.  You own one grid, and your opponent owns the other.

3.  Players take turns.  On each turn you write down a word in the
upmost available horizontal row on your grid.  Your score for turn is
the number of letters that your word shares with your opponent's most
recently played word, times the number of letters in the longest word
that you formed <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>vertically<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> when you added the new word
horizontally.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What if you form two mor more vertical words?  Does only the longest
count, or do you get extra for the others?

Let us say that the first word on your grid is "bat" and you play
"today" under it such that you form "at" and "to" vertically.  Will this
score more than positioning the new word so you only form "by"?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.  the first letter of your word may be in any cell, as long as the
word fits completely in your grid.

5.  No word may be played twice, and you may not play a word that
contains in its entirety a word previously played by any player.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It seems like you can obstruct by playing the words "A" or "I".
Granted, they won't score much, but some players may do this if they
can't play anything better.  Maybe you should limit word lengths to
three or more letters (many word games do).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
6.  There's a bonus if your word is an anagram of your opponent's most
recently played word.

7.  Game ends after say, 8 turns.  Highest score wins.

8.  If you think your opponent played a fake word, you can challenge
it, and if it is a fake word, you're opponent gets zero points for his
turn.  If your challenge fails, you must skip your next turn.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why not let the falsely challenged word count double instead of letting
the challenger lose a turn?  This seems simpler.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Fake words <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> removed from the board after they've been
played.

9.  Since the score is undefined for the each player's first turn, the
first turn of the game works differently:

-To begin, a word is picked randomly from the dictionary, and then
player 1 writes that word into his topmost gridline.  He also adds any
number of points he wants to either player's score column.  Then
player 2 decides whether to play as player 1 or player 2.  This acts
as a pie rule, and the randomly chosen initial word ensures that each
game will proceed very differently.
-The score for player 2's first turn is the just the number of letters
that his first word shares with the randomly chosen word that player 1
wrote down on his first turn.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think some of the problem with analysis paralysis is if you have too
many choices that are not obviously bad.

One change that might reduce the number of sensible choices is to make a
word score the number of letters it shares with the opponent's word
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>minus<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the number of letters it has that the opponent's word does not.

For example, if the opponent wrote "bats" and you write "basin" you get
3-2 = 1 point, so it would be better to write "bans" instead, which
scores 3-1 = 2 points.  Obviously, this doesn't account for vertical
words nor that "stab" or "tabs" seem like even better choices.

The idea is that you would get no benefit for looking for longer words,
so you stop searching for better solutions earlier.  Also, you can
remove the extra bonus for anagrams.

You could also make play simultaneous: After each round, you swap grids
and secretly add a new word underneath the bottom word.  You reveal
simultaneously and score.  You could add that a player has to finish in
no more than 30 seconds (or 15?) once the other declares that he is
done.

Simultaneous play also allow more than two to play, since there is less
down time.  You could also do away with the random seeding and let each
player write the first word before passing his grid on to the next.  You
can require these initial words to be exactly (say) four letters long
and give penalty to players that use the same initial word.
