Yep. There was a surge of interest and design activity for a few years there, but those days seem to be gone.

Evaluating "quality" of discussion is a quagmire that I won't enter. Who is the arbiter of what is significant or not ?

I guess it is subjective.  I can only say that personally I find topics such as "My favorite gipf game" unbearable.  No I'm not jealous.  Gipf games were always for me a primary example of what not to do.  Other unbearable topics: New, bad, arbitrary, non-organic games.  Old, bad games revisited.  Anything related to Nestor.  Nobody is as fucked as Nestor.

I listen to everybody. I find the style of Mo not very conductive to proper discussion; in particular the many replies in short succession and the "black or white" approach. Nevertheless, I recognize he has good points at times. No need to sugar coat anything; the objective of discussion is to be productive and intellectually stimulating.

No but there is a need to sugar coat contrary opinions at bgg, megamau.  That's the most fucked up thing about bgg.  It's an Orwellian, sugarcoated lala land.  Without the sugar, you'll be labeled a troll, and eventually Bitchtavian will boot you out.

Abstract Games Designers, in particular good ones, tend to be self-centered. I'm sure you are aware of that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Self-centered is kind of an overly simplistic label, except when applied to Christian Freeling.  The good designers tend to have issues such as Asperger's syndrome, as I probably do.  I'll find out when the extensive testing I'm going through right now is completed.  E.g., yes, I have a strong interest in license plate numbers.  So far I'm doing extremely well in some cognitive areas, and terribly in others.

Even if you ignore all the posts from Christian, there is still a lot going on at BGG.

lol, good strategy

As of today I am still not certain if the "ms_designer" account is yours, a sockpuppet of Massakra or a third person altogether: that's why the "perhaps" is there.

Isn't there a clue in the name, "MS_designer", megamau?  :D

In any of the three cases, I won't discount his points "a priori": I prefer to evaluate the merits of a position instead of the people who present them.

Good outlook, megamau :)
