Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
       o x o x o x         (1) Double-move -- x places one stone, then
      . . . . . . .            players alternate placing up to two stones.

  . . . . . . . . . . .        row wins.
The game couldn't be simpler or quicker to play, but I haven't "figured
it out" after several games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The game appears to be interesting. However, I would like to see a
much bigger board or do you intend to create another children's game?


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The next variant would allow a stone to be
placed at the same level as a friendly stone (2A).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think i just solved this variant for any board size.
Both players try to reach the central square(s) of the bottom-most row as
fast as possible. This results in a straight race of one flow by each
player. As soon the bottom is reached the players spread their stones to
one side of the board.
If the bottom-most row numbers an even number of squares the game is a
draw, otherwise it is a win for the second player because he is ahead in
the race.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A more chaotic variant
requires only adjacency to a stone of either color (2B), but a stone cut
off from receiving (downward or sideways) "flow" is immediately removed
(similar idea as Greg's).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pieces cannot move, right? This means that a stone cannot be cut off
from the "flow" except it is placed on a square where it is not connected
to the flow right from the beginning. However, it doesn't make sense in
this game to place a  stone on the board which is removed immediately.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Finally, stones can be placed anywhere (2C).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This makes no sense to me either. Could you please explain your idea?
What would be the goal of this game, etc. ???

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I call this series of games Cascades.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Except the first one, these are not games. These are just ideas of games.
