            DAO VS. NEUTREEKO

After seeing how "hyped up" the game of Dao
was on the web page <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.playdao.com">http://www.playdao.com</a> ,
I decided to take William Chang's "challenge"
in another thread here on rec.games.abstract
and analyze it as I had done with Neutreeko
(for details about this game, see the bottom
of <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm">http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm</a> .
Btw I decided not to add any rules and just
cancelled my post about that idea.) Here are
my findings.

Approximately 4 out of 5 legal Dao-positions
are draws. More precisely, the program found
700,354 positions where black is to play and
neither player can force a win. This is 79%
of the 884,106 possible positions that it
considered (which includes just-finished
games, but not games where one player had
just lost by isolating one of the opponent's
pieces in a corner). In comparison, only
about 5% of the positions in Neutreeko are
draws. The starting position in Dao (with
the two diagonals) is a draw.

The longest perfect games in Dao where one
player eventually wins have only 11 moves.
I count one move from each side as two moves.
This is only one third of the length of the
longest perfect games in Neutreeko. A computer
could store a selected part of the P-positions
and be invincible even with a shallow search.
Of course, that doesn't really separate
Neutreeko from Dao, but even a human could
probably memorize the 8-move and 10-move
P-positions and learn to look for wins or
losses at most 8 moves ahead. There are 48
11-move N-positions but only 16 10-move
P-positions, and they are all rotations or
mirrorings of these two:

+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | o |     | o |   |   | o |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
| o | o | o | x |     |   | o | o | x |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   | x | x | x |     |   | x | x | x |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+

   x to play; o will win in 10 moves

Here are two possible starting positions
for Neutreeko. The first one is the one
that is a win in 33 moves - theoretically
interesting but not very symmetric. The
other one is the first possibility I
thought of after coming up with the rules,
and it turns out to be a loss in 16 moves.
There are also lots of draws to choose
from.

+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   | o |   | o |     |   | o |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   | x |     | x |   | x |   |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
|   | x |   |   |     |   | o |   | o |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+
| x | o |   |   |     |   |   | x |   |
+---+---+---+---+     +---+---+---+---+

               x to play

I hope I can decide on one suitable starting
position in the near future. One of the things
I am concerned about is that neither side should
be able to force a 4-move loop (which would be a
draw) very early.
