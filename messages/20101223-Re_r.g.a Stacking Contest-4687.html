Mark,
Deadline - First of spring due date is alright by me.  That would be
March 20th.
**Any other deadline date preferences anyone?
Entries - I see no harm in having multiple entries.  I was just
thinking that there might be a lot of games to test for the vote and I
had a hunch that Christian could bust out 20 or so in a week ;P
Topology - "The only limit on how wide to crack it open is that it
should be playable in real life."  Sounds good.  I guess I would add
that you can stray from the norm 'at your own risk'.  Meaning that if
you're gonna use some crazy rhombic dodecahedron stacking you'd best
have a program that we can all use to play it on or it might not get
tested.  I wouldn't reject an entry on this condition though, I'd be
way to curious for one thing :).  It'd just be hard to get votes for
something nobody can play.

Dieter,
I see no problem with pulling out unfinished work.  If a contest can
motivate finishing something then I'm all for it.
About the stacking I guess you're right!  I never thought of it that
way, but I suppose a stacking game would need to distinguish itself
from a game where there's a pool of something having an arbitrary
position such as a mancala game or a territorial majority.
**Any other thoughts on stacking definition?  I wasn't expecting this.
Günter says hello btw.  I work with him at the Spielwiese boardgames
cafe.  I was really surprised to see his name on one of your design
pages at BGG!
