Many board games can be generalized to however many players.

The main problem with such games is that it is difficult for the players to
have an overview of the board. If the player can not see/analyze the whole
board, the game in effect becomes one of imperfect information.

Another problem is that in a multi-player game in many cases either
1. have the leader bashing problem (i.e. the other players may cooperate to
stop the leader)
2. have too little interaction between the players to make the game
interesting.

Also, again thinking of an abstract game as a strategic/tactical game where
you can make long-term plans. With multiple players too much changes between
the turns for this to be possible.

I just had a thought.  Are there any such games?
Well maybe not on the order of thousands like Ultima,
but how about a game that could accommodate 10 or 20
and yet be purely abstract.  At the moment, the most
I can think of is 6-bowl Abalone.
