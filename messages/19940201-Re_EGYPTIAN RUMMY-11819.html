Anyone know the ruled to this card game?
I seem to remember it was a combination of slap jack and war, but with
a number of rules that made it more strategic and complex.
I've also heard it refered to as ratscrew(sp?)

If you can help me out I'd appreciate it.

heh... egyptian ratscrew, my most favorite cardgame ever :)

the rules that i learned are as follows:
  
 the object of the game is to get all the cards.
 divide the deck as equally as possible between all players, keep the cards 
   facedown in one pile.  no one is too ever look at the cards in their hand.
 each player in turn takes the top card from their pile and turns it face up
   onto a central pile.  the card should be placed as quickly as possible so
   no one sees the card before anyone else.
 if the card is of the same value as the last card (e.g. if plater A puts down
   a six and the player B puts down the next card, which is also a six) then
   the first player to slap the central pile gets all the cards in that pile.
   play then passes to the player who first slapped in.  this applies to ALL
   cards, royalty included.
 if a player should put down a royalty (A,K,Q,J) then the next player must 
   also put down a royalty.  if that next player fails to get a royalty, the
   player who played it gets all the cards in the central pile.  the chance
   for the second player to get a royalty is depenedant on the type the first
   player played:  4 chances if it was an ace, 3 if it was a king, 2 for queen
   and 1 for jack (making the jack the most powerful card in the game).
   e.g.  Player A plays a Queen.  Player B now has two chances to play a
         royalty himself - lets say Player B reveals his card and get a 4.
         Player B now has one more chance to get a royalty - if he gets a 
         7, for example, Player A then claims all of the cards in the pile.
         If, however, Player B should happen to get, for example, a King, 
         Player C will now have 3 chances to get a royalty - if C fails to do
         so, Player B can claim all the cards; if C does get a royalty, Player
         D will then be so obligated, and so on.
 (this next rule i am not too sure if it is 'standard' but i always insist on
    it whenever i play)
 when one player has finally acquired all the cards, he must run through the
   entire deck one last time so the other players can slap in if doubles 
   should occur.  this can be skipped if you are pressed for time.
 any time anyone does something illegal, the offending player must take the
   top card from their hand and place it, face up, at the bottom of the 
   central pile.  such "illegal" actions include, but are not limited to:
     playing a card out of turn
     slapping in when you should not have
     playing a card so slowly such that the person playing it sees what it is
       before anyone else.
   these acts are called 'slurfs' or 'sluffs' and committing one is 'slurfing'
   or 'sluffing'.  when a player detects such an act, that player should call
   out 'slurf' (or 'sluff') and announce what the problem and the players 
   decide on the appropriate action to be taken against the offender [usually 
   the placing of the top card on the bottom of the pile]

 ummm... i think that's it - i feel as though i have forgotten something, but
  i cant think of what.  oh well - if you have any questions, mail me at:
