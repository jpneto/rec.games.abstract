<br><blockquote type=cite>Here is a game for 2 players.
<br>
<br>Needed: An n-by-n grid drawn on paper (with an n of at least 8, I 
suggest). Two markers (such as coins), one for each player. The markers 
should be small enough to both fit in one square of the grid (possibly 
by stacking them). Two pencils/pens of different colors.
<br>
<br>The players start the game by each placing their marker in any square
<br>of the grid different from where their opponent placed her/his marker.
<br>The players then mark the squares they start in with an X (or with
<br>different symbols, especially if the colors of their pens/pencils are
<br>similar).
<br>
<br></blockquote>Let there be two players, with marks X and O.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>A "move" consists of both players moving one square each.
<br>Players alternate, taking turns who is the "directioner" and who is
<br>the "decider".
<br>
<br>On a move, first the decider decides if the players will move in
<br>opposition or in synch, and announces this decision. Then the
<br>directioner decides which of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right,
<br>or diagonally) the directioner will then move, then he/she moves his/
<br>her marker.
<br>
<br>If the decider decided that the players move in synch, then the
<br>decider must move his/her marker one square in the same direction
<br>(from his/her current position) that the directioner moved her/his
<br>piece (from the directioner's previous position).
<br>
<br>If the decider decided that the players move in opposition, then the
<br>decider must move his/her marker one square in the exact opposite
<br>direction (from his/her current position) that the directioner moved
<br>her/his piece (from the directioner's previous position).
<br>
<br>Based on where the players are at the beginning of a move, the
<br>directioner must pick a direction where both players stay on the
<br>board.
<br>
<br>If any player moves his/her marker onto an empty square, then that
<br>player draws his/her symbol in the empty square. But if both players
<br>move onto the same empty square, or a player moves onto a square with
<br>a symbol already in it, then no symbol is drawn by that player on that
<br>move.
<br>
<br></blockquote>A more dynamic version would be to let the player
<br>put his mark on unmarked square or change the mark to his mark.
<br>
<br>A choatic version would be to let the player put his mark on
<br>unmarked squares or squares with the opponet's mark and to
<br>remove his mark if moving onto a square with his mark
<br>(alternatively instead of removing, change to his opponents mark).
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>When all squares are filled up with symbols, or when one player has
<br>more symbols than the number of symbols his/her opponent has + the
<br>number of empty squares, then the game ends. The player with the most
<br>squares with his/her symbol is the winner.
<br>
<br></blockquote>For my variations, the game ends when the board is filled with marks.
<br>The variation allowing removal of marks may be prolonged forever.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>A variation: (Is this more or less fun than the first version?)
<br>The directioner picks the direction first, then the decider decides if
<br>she/he will move his/her piece in synch or in opposition. (The
<br>directioner, in this version, only moves based on whether he/she can
<br>stay on the board, then the decider must move to stay on the board.)
<br></blockquote>
<br>Simple versions would be to take turn moving while leaving, removing,
<br>or changing marks according to the variations discussed above.
