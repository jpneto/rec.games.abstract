	Hi,

	I have just bought an interesting "Trivial Pursuit like" new board game
which enables to learn foreign languages with fun.
	It is called "TRIACTION" and can can be played in :
French, English, Spanish, Italian, German and Portugese.
	The aim is by miming or drawing to make your partner find a
word or sentence in the languages he speaks.
People of different countries which don't even speak a tongue in common
can also play together.
	Has anybody else already heard of it?



PS: if somebody is interested I can provide the address where to get the game.
