Strong Havannah bots:

Castrohttp://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player.jsp?plid=21870
Rating to date: 1794
Rank to date: 19
Havannah program written by Timo Ewalds at the University of Alberta,
Canada. UCT based, with rave, some knowledge, and a few other tricks,
written in C++. Currently accepting unrated games on all sizes, and
rated games on the smaller sizes for now. Used 90s per move for the
first few games, using 5 minutes per move now.

An Havannah bot written by Richard Lorentz with the help of students.
Thanks to klaashaas for providing the Ruby s-cripts that allow
wanderer_c to work without any human intervention and thanks to
Richard Pijl for his technical advice.http://www.csun.edu/~lorentz/

This is the program Valkyria written by Magnus Persson spending about.
2-10 minutes per move on a fast machine. If the game is over I will
take over and just finish it. The program will resign if you get a
clear won position.http://senseis.xmp.net/?Valkyria

Quote by Timo Ewalds:
In Hex, virtual connections are guaranteed connections, assuming you
choose to defend them, but there is never any reason to not defend
them. In Havannah, they are not guaranteed. Frames are often broken,
like in the game against Christian Freeling, or could be broken like
in this game. A frame that can't be broken is also not necessarily a
winning formation, since it could be too slow. It's also not obvious
how to use a partial frame, since it could be used in many different
ways but with different speeds or certainties.
There are several examples of games where the opponent had a
guaranteed win in 2 while Castro was about 10 moves away from a win
and without a good frame, but Castro still won by using 9 forcing
moves.
Castro does recognize the bridge virtual connection, and is encouraged
to maintain them, both in the tree and in the rollouts. It can't be
forced to maintain them though, since there may be more important
moves elsewhere, like if this virtual connection is now in a dead
area. Even when it is encouraged to maintain the virtual connection
and when there is a frame, it is tough to see it since the frame may
not succeed in a rollout because some other winning formation could
happen first. Finding the specific move to refute the frame is even
harder given random rollouts.http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=50&amp;topic=459

In the summer of 2012 I will play ten base-10 games against the
offspring of these bots and/or other bots.
My current rating is 1947, rank 7 and a good record against bots,
although I've lost a couple of base-8 games and even one or two
base-10, if I remember correctly.
On small boards, say up to and including base-6, strategy and tactics
become so intrinsically linked that it's all tactics and humans have
little chance. If they drift apart, base-8/10, the bots get blind
spots.
Fortunately :)
So, do I stand a chance to win the 10 out of 10 implied in the
challenge?

The most interesting thing about all this is not necessarily whether
you will win or lose in 2012, Christian (Yes, I think you have a
chance, but given that the bar is set at 10 out of 10 I would tend to
favor the bots), but how much programming effort has gone into
Havannah.  I'm sure the challenge prize accounts for some of it, but
not all of it.  Other modern games I can think of that have attracted
significant efforts from programmers include Arimaa, Lines of Action,
Amazons.  I believe there is also a challenge prize for Arimaa.
