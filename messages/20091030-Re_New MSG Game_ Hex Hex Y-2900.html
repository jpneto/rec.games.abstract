Well, after you accused me of "stalking" you for posting on the same
forums as you (apparently it didn't occur to you that I might be
interested in abstract games), you can hardly blame me for not
examining your site in detail, can you?

I'm not bored enough right now to go through all the sites you have
convinced to carry your games. I just repeat: Tanbo, 27 games all
time. Slime Trail, 39 games this month alone. On igc at least, the
real-time site with most abstract games, Mark Steere games are hardly
played - all of them less than Bill Taylor's "Slime Trail", as far as
I can see.

You're good at getting your games to servers, I'll give you that. But
when players have a choice, they seem to prefer other designer's
games...

If you want to really blow a fuse, Mark, compare your own games'
popularity on IGC to that of Ralf Gering's "Kauri"!
