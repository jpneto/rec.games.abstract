Interesting statement, but I doubt that it's defensible.

The complexity of R-P-S arises from psychology. In Go there are no perfect
players, so it is necessary to adapt strategy according to the understanding
of the other guy's personality and perceived technique.  For example, I'm
less inclined to make risky moves against someone who I believe has a
strong understanding of tesuji. Given the much greater range of effects
that psychology can bring into the game, how is R-P-S more complex or
challenging? I'm sure Chess players can make a similar case for their game.

No.  My statement is quite defensible.  The false warrant you use is
that the psychology involved in chess or go is equatable with the
psychology involved in RPS.  Given that my statement was qualified to
limit scope to "it's own way" I can choose <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> means of evaluating
the complexity issues, or <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> definition of challenging which puts
RPS ahead of the other two.  You next statement will help my derive
my final point out of this.

|&gt; Trying to justify game preference logically is a futile proposal, and we
|&gt; can do without the psuedo-logic that comes from the attempt.

Within limits. Would you argue with the claim that Chess is objectively
better than 3x3 tic-tac-toe because the latter is well within (adult)
human capability for complete analysis, with no room for psychology?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No.  Consider the phrase "objectively better", as my whole argument is
that this is a meaningless phrase.  "Better" implies a set of values,
which are nescessarily individual, while "obejctively" limits to things
which are not individual.  I state categorically that such a system of
universal values which transends point of view does not and can not
exist.  What is "better" depends on what you want.
