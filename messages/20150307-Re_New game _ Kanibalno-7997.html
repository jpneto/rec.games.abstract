Name game : Kanibalno

Kanibalno is an abstract game for 2 players based on new capturing system.

Goal : capture all of your opponent tokens to win

Material 

Squared board : 6*6
36 tokens : 18 red 18 blue
Each set of 18 tokens is composed by 6 copies of tokens numbered from 1 to 3.

Setup :
At the setup all 36 tokens are placed randomly

Rules :
Choose who play first 
Blue start the game and then players take their turn alternatively

On his turn a player :
- move one of his token without capture
- or move to capture one of his opponent token

Moves :

Only orthogonal move is allowed (horizontaly or verticaly)
Token are moved like chess rook
No jump is allowed
No passing turn is allowed

Capture :

Capture is allowed only if the token to be captured has a different value than the capturor token.
Examples : 
1 can capture 2 or 3 but never 1
2 can capture 1 or 3 but never 2
3 can capture 2 or 1 but never 3

Only opponent tokens can be captured
No multicapture is allowed
Capturing is not mandatory

The game ends when one of the 2 players has no token to move. 
The winner is the one who annihilated his opponent.

Modification : 
Move one square orthogonaly if no capture
Move like rook if there will be a capture at the end of the move

End of the game : the game could be draw if no one could annihilate his opponent.
