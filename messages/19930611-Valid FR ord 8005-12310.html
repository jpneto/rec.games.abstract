These are the Round 8 Fantasy Rule Valid Ordinances: 


Ordinance 8001 (Chatham):

Rule of Hypocrisy:
Any subsequently posted fantasy rule must violate any and all 
restrictions it would impose on future fantasy rules.

Ordinance 8002 (Chatham):

Each subsequent fantasy rule A must include an example of a fantasy rule
B that would be valid if A were valid and this rule (this very rule, the
one you are now reading) had not been posted.
                        
Ordinance 8003 (Davidb):

Any future Fantasy Rules Committee Ordinances must be written using words
of only one syllable.  The 8002 mandated example is:
         All new rules must have the word "smile" in them.

Ordinance 8005 (Ferro):

 From now on, no rule may state a word more than once.  To wit, "No new
rules can have the word 'smile' in them."  Note that this one says "no"
and "word" three times each.

P.S. Are you going to score the previously posted ordinances?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
No. Nor am I going to score this one.  Nor any future ones.  Scores
are for morons.  People need to have their own sense of an aesthetic; I'm
not going to be the one to say what's better or worse than what else.

(Ferro scores -3 and a boot to the head for bringing the issue up)
