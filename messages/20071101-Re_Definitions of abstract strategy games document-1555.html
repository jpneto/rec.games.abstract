<br><blockquote type=cite>Let's look at the NULL again for a minute:
<br>[Null attributes]
<br>* Types:
<br>- Void: Pieces into Null never return to game (eliminated).
<br>- Single space: Has capacity of one. Prior pieces sent to equivalent
<br>of Void (described above)
<br>- Pool: Pieces can enter back into play into play in any order
<br>- Queue: Pieces enter back into play into a sequence.
<br>- Multiple Queue: Each player has his own queue.
<br>
<br>The reason has to do with exactly how games would leave or enter the
<br>game.&nbsp; It is a minutia difference, but important for games where there
<br>is queuing, and how pieces enter the board.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Sure it's important to the individual game, but back at our 
Checkmate Championship we have Shogi with a pool of taken pieces to 
re-enter play, and we have [Western] Chess which has a potential 
pool from promotions, and I'm sure there are variants with all 
sorts of other flavours including a void, and so on, and yet 
they're all being played in the Checkmate Championship.&nbsp; So my 
question remains, why do we need to know all that in the basic 
taxonomy document?
<br>
<br>For your tournament taxonomy you only want it if you're using it to 
define the tournament parameters, or at least so I'd have thought. 
&nbsp;As well as e.g. Chartrang plus descendants, do you envisage a 
tournament category of Null Multiple Queue games?&nbsp; I'd have thought 
it's an entirely secondary characteristic for your taxonomical 
purposes?
<br>
<br>I'd be putting that sort of detail in small print in a second tier 
document, rather than giving it to people to wade through at the off.
<br>
<br>Pete.
