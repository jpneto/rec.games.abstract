I agree that a free PDF magazine is where you start.  If you can't get
a sufficient reader base for a free online magazine, you'll never
succeed in print.  Luca, if you are ever interested in publishing in
English as well, let me know.  I would be happy to help with
translation.

I believe a good chunk of the new Abstract Games magazine would need
to be dedicated to traditional abstract strategy games, and be used as
a promotion piece for all abstract strategy games, not just newer
ones.

The idea of the magazine and the association would be to get more
people interest and also allow the other associations to experiment
with new rules, like the use of a doubling cube for more abstract
strategy games.
