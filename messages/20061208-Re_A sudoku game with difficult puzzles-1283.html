Me, I'm lukewarm to sudoku; I find them repetitive, but they can
be a fine way to warm up my brain for other things, or a way to
kill a few minutes (or longer, for difficult ones) in waiting rooms
or the like.  Analysing how to solve them can be interesting at a
meta-level.

However, they're most certainly not "games".  They are puzzles.
Like other puzzles, you could consider them to be solitaire games,
though I would propose a definition where a puzzle, where a solution
is guaranteed to exist and you're just trying to find it, is not a
game.  Shuffling a deck of cards and then trying to reach a winning
position according to some set of rules, but you don't know if it
can be done, is a solitaire game.

So though I think Mark's reaction is a bit over the top, I would have
to agree that the original post is off-topic for the groups to which
it was posted.  Which raises the question: can a game -- for two or
more players -- be derived from sudoku?  For instance, consider a
game where players start with an empty 9x9 grid, or perhaps one with
a few digits filled in, and on your turn you can do one of three
things:

1) fill in another digit
2) assert that the grid defines a unique sudoku solution
3) assert that the grid no longer permits any sudoku solution

It's sort of like playing "ghost" or Lairs Dice or other such games,
where you have to raise or challenge.  Checking the assertion could
be done easily by computer.  Would sudoku-lovers enjoy such a game?
