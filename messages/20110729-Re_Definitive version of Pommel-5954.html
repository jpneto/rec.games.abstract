Insead, if a captain, when not capturing, had to stop on a hexagon
where it can be captured (i.e. with an empty cell behind it or behind
the line of men it belongs to, if the oppossing piece is a captain,
and also adjacent to it, if it's a soldier), and stalemate were a
loss, then Pommel would be, needless to say, categorically drawless. I
guess the rule I've quoted doesn't mean that.

On the other hand, according to the same rule, captains must stop in
hexagons where they can "see" <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> oppossing piece, soldier or
captain. If that's so, many trivial draws are possible. Imagine a
position where each player has one captain on any square and one
soldier on a corner cell. Players could move their respective captains
always in line of sight of the oppossing soldier, but never actually
capturing it. Am I right?

This looks like an unnecessary restriction to me. Captains are already
very open to attack with the Mad Bishops rule. Why add another rule to
demote them further?

Meanwhile, linear capture makes for a very attacking game, doesn't it?
The games must be real slaughters (and great fun).
