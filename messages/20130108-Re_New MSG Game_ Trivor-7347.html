Trouble is, perfect balance already has meaning.  Perfect balance simply means perfect balance.  It's an ideal.  It's a limit which is approached but never reached.

The only one "bending" here is you, Christian.  If you want to define a concept, use a term which isn't already taken.  Don't use an existing, well defined, long established term, and bastardize it for your own self-serving purposes.  That's all I ask.

How would you define a balancing mechanismlike the pie rule, that serves the ideal by resolving possible conflict about it? Is there anything else that matters than resolving the issue? Does it matter that 'perfect' cannot be reached?
More generally, what is 'imperfect' about say 'perfect information'. Is that too 'an ideal that never can be reached'? Not to mention a 'perfect day'. Did you ever have one?
