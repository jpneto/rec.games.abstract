We have now got the Azacru software available to play on the net (IE5
upwards) either side by side or against the AI player. (bottom of page at

Azacru is a sophisticated abstract game for 2,3 or 4 players. (More complex 
than Shacru, but much less than Pacru)  The art of the game is to build 
possible connections around the board so that as the game draws to the close 
you can gain as many of your opponents tiles while losing as few of your 
own:

Azacru Rules:

Each player is represented by one colour: and they use the pieces and tiles 
of that colour.

The order of play between the different colours is a matter of choice. You 
can decide which player is using which colour, and the order of play, by any 
reasonable means.

If there are three or four players in the game, then each player has three 
pieces to start: for the two player game each has four.

Take it in turns to move one piece at a time.  You cannot pass on a turn 
unless you cannot move.    You can move any of your pieces one space 
straight ahead, or at a 45 degree angle to the direction it is pointing. 
After a move, leave the piece pointing in the direction you've moved it. 
This is the only way that pieces move from tile to tile.

Each time you move a piece you replace the tile you are arriving on with 
your own colour tile.

When you move a piece across a border, you can set it down as normal after 
the move (leaving the piece pointing in the direction you've moved it) or 
choose to twist the piece forty five degrees to the the left or to the right 
as part of your turn.

You may not move onto a tile that is another player's colour.  You may not 
move onto a tile where another piece is sitting.  Except for a connection 
jump you may not jump over any piece.

POWER OF MOVEMENT: Count the tiles of your colour in the borderland and that 
number is the power of movement of the piece.  If there are no tiles, the 
power of movement

is one. You can move that particular piece any number of tiles between one 
and

its power of movement.

LONG MOVE: When you move your piece more than one tile (a long move), you 
cannot change direction in the middle of the move.  You must move in a 
straight line (directly ahead, or ahead at 45 degrees).  At the end of the 
move leave the piece pointing in the direction you have moved it, unless you 
have crossed a border in which case you can twist it as usual.

CONNECTION CHANGE: When you make a long move from one tile of your colour to 
another tile of your colour (a connection), and you are not jumping any 
pieces, you must change all the intervening tiles to your colour.   If your 
connection change involves changing one or more tiles belonging to another 
player, then your piece is taken off the board as soon as the move is made.

CONNECTION JUMP: When you move from one tile of your colour to another tile 
of your colour, you are allowed to jump any intervening pieces.  However 
when you make a connection jump, you do not make a connection change and so 
no intervening tiles are changed.

Eventually one player in the game will not be able to make a move on their 
turn: either all their pieces have left the board, or none of the their 
remaining pieces can move.  After this has happened all the other players 
(or those that can) continue for just one turn each.   The winner of the 
game is the player with most tiles on the board at the end of the game (this 
may be the player who was first unable to move).   It is possible to use the 
number of tiles on the board of each player as a score and then play several 
games as a set, totalling the score from each game.
