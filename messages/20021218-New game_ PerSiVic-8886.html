Last summer, Ernesto Amezcua Montes [1] invented a game called
PerSiVic.  It is inspired by chess, but has some mancala-like and
go-like aspects to it.

It tries to have rules which are as simple as possible, and as high of
a branching factor as possible, so as to discourage computers from
beating humans at the game.  I have not play-tested the game myself,
but it looks worthwhile to look at.

He orignally posted his rules in Spanish; I have translated them in to
English.

He claims a copyright on the rules; I am copyrighting my translation
as a result.

The rules in English are here:

The original Spanish rules:

Montes is his mother's last name.
