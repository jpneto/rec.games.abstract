Introduction

It's not much fun to play sprouts with playing cards, but it is
possible. Why would anyone want to do such a thing? Maybe it will be
easier to analyze the game this way, or more straightforward to
implement it on a computer. Maybe you're just fresh out of pens and
paper.

To play a game with N initial spots, you'll need three identical decks
of playing cards with at least 3N+1 distinct cards in each deck. This
way each card will have exactly two identical "twins". (Actually, the
cards are incidental; integers will suffice. This document is really
about how to generate legal moves and update a position represented in
Dan Hoey's boundary-list notation.) In the rules below, we'll assume
you've combined the three decks into one large deck. You will also
need a flat space for at least 2N+1 rows of cards. A large wooden
table will do nicely. Each row will contain zero or more stacks of
cards, and each stack will contain one or more cards.

To "cut" a stack of cards means the usual thing: remove one or more
cards from the top of the stack (preserving order) and put them under
the remaining cards in the stack.

To "play" a card, remove it from the deck and place it in the
specified location.

Initial position and play

The initial position consists of N different cards, each in an
isolated stack, all in the same row. Players take turns moving. There
are two kinds of moves, joining moves and dividing moves. On his turn,
a player must execute either a legal joining move or a legal dividing
move, but not both in the same turn.  Under the normal play
convention, the last player wins. Under the misere play convention,
the last player loses.

Joining moves

A joining move combines two stacks in the same row. If any step of the
move is not possible, the move is illegal.

   1. Choose two different nonempty stacks A and B in the same row.
      Optionally, cut stack A. Optionally, cut stack B.
   2. If A has more than one card, then play a twin of the top card to
      the bottom of stack A.
   3. If B has more than one card, then play a twin of the top card to
      the bottom of stack B.
   4. From the deck, remove two identical cards that are not already
      on the table. Place one on top of A, and one on top of B.
   5. Place A on top of B.

Dividing moves

A dividing move divides a stack into two stacks, one of which is
placed in a new row. One or more stacks from the original row may be
moved to the new row.  If any step of the move is not possible, the
move is illegal.

   1. Choose a nonempty stack. Optionally, cut it.
   2. Play a twin of the top card to the bottom of the stack.
   3. Remove one or more cards -- but not all of them -- from the top
      of the stack and place them in a new row.
   4. If the original stack or the new stack has more than one card,
      then play a twin of the the bottom card of the new stack to the
      top of the original stack.
   5. From the deck, remove two identical cards that are not already
      on the table. Place one on top of the new stack, and one on top
      of the original stack.
   6. Optionally, move one or more stacks -- other than the original
      stack -- from the original row to the new row.

Example game

Consider the following game (in the notation used by the World Game of
Sprouts Association): 2+ 1(3)2 1(4)2 1(5)4 2(6)3

Here's how that game would be played with cards. To represent the
position in text, we will use the following conventions: A stack of
cards is written in order from top card to bottom, with a comma
between each card. A semicolon separates each stack from adjacent
stacks in the same row. A slash separates each row from its neighbors.
is the notation used by Dan Hoey in his paper on sprouts
notation.)

Analogy with graph theory

We have represented a plane graph using rows of stacks of cards.
