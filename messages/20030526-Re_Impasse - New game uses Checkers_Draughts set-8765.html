I'm using a thin client model for tanbo.com.  Your browser is your client. 
I tried make it strictly html, but I ended up including a few snippets of
JavaScript to set the focus on form elements, etc.  It's not essential
though for the site to function.  My own ignorance was and still is an
obstacle.  I kind of got over the hump by reading a stack of books three
feet high.  And I got invaluable help from a few saintly souls in various
help forums.  Starting out though, there was a good three month stagnation
period because my initial host providers were f'ing idiots who kept
"escalating the matter" indefenitely.  I, being an idiot too, kept believing
this.  I got a new host provider and made a few trips to the bookstore.  Now
I'm a few weeks away from having a functioning Tanbo site.  (At leas it
"feels" like it should be a few weeks.  Don't quote me on this though.)

I tried to find a reference to Xong with google.  Apparently it means
something in Vietnamese.  I got about 18 pages of mostly Vietnamese
references.  I know I've seen Xong somewhere though.

I never made a penny with Tanbo.  But I may set up cash tournaments on
tanbo.com at some point. For Impasse, I'd like to publish a mini-book, and
I'm just now looking into the possibilities.

Fortunately I have my own apartment.  So if my girlfriend breaks up with me,
I can just go home.  My cats would love to have me back full time.

i too am in the process of formulating a server/client
package for my game, Xong. i find the innards of CORBA
and IIOP rather alien &amp; stuffy for my taste, yet i must
do something along that line. also, it appears that the
world of IT jobhunting favors the CORBA expertise. :-(
i have the java applets for Standard Xong &amp; Random Xong
single workstation play all done. but playing over the
internet has been put on hold for quite awhile because
of my ignorance.

on another topic - do you make any money with tanbo? or
is this similar to the plight of the folksinger? (you
know, like "What do you call a folksinger who just got
dumped by his girlfriend? - Homeless."
