In my (not very sophisticated) understanding of Chess, the weaker player
can try to reach a draw by forcing the stronger player into a situation
where any departure from a repetitive sequence is a disaster.  If the
repetition were simply ruled to be illegal, the idea of what constitutes
a strong position would change.  But the rule that no captures for some
number of turns is a draw could be unchanged.  It seems to me that this
is fairly simple, and removes many draws.  Is it a bad idea for some
other reason, am I missing something, or do some people consider the
draws desirable?

  As someone else pointed out, the no repetition move in chess would make
endgames very strange.  This is not to say it wouldn't be interesting, but
if you think the endgame has a different feel now, this would far more so.

The latest candidates for 'flawless' games seem to be Hex, Traxx and
Twixt.  These are all games involving a sequence of placed pieces, with
no moves or captures.  If I'm remembering 'Winning Ways' correctly,
these games can all be reduced to Nim or Sprouts, and can be solved
without exploring the entire game tree.  I speculate that any game which
does not have the potential of infinite duration (thus requiring the no
repeats rule or some equivalent) is in the general class of games that
can be reduced to Nim.  Does anyone know of any proofs or disproofs of
this speculation?

  This is definitely not true.  The games which can be reduced to Nim
(Sprouts can't, and hasn't been solved ... another good game, but the
three lives per vertex is too arbitrary to call it perfect.) are exactly
those where 1) The game always terminates, even it the players don't
               alternate moves.
            2) From every position both players have exactly the same
               legal moves, and exactly the same winning podsitions,
               etc.  This is not true for games like Hex, Twixt, Traxx,
               or Go, since which color you are makes a difference.

  There are many games which are of this form, and still unsolved. 
The isomorphism with Nim requires knowing the entire game tree (more
or less), so it's not that helpful.  An example of this is Sylver
Coinage:  The players alternate naming positive intergers, and are
not allowed to name anything which is a positive integer linear
combination of previously named numbers.  You lose if you name 1 (or,
equivalently naming 1 is illegal, and you lose if you can't move).

We are faced with the very real possibility that "digital" and 
"manual" will be used as antonyms.
