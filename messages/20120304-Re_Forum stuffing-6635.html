My idea was that either player starts with Black, and they alternate for those 4 moves (2 moves each), then Black chooses to play move 5, or swap colours because even with the initiative to Black, he prefers White.

This doesn't work. Black will simply play optimally from start and play move 5 as Black to retain his advantage.

Quite right, what a boneheaded suggestion of mine. Yes, it would have to be after 3 or 5 moves - 5 would be interesting I think, as it's likely to constitute the first approach move, which makes strategic understanding particularly important.

Graham, this balancing rule of yours doesn't work, no matter which number (odd or even, greater than 1) of moves are made before the choice of colors. The point is that, if the turn alternation starts before that, the choosing player will always try to make the position as unbalanced as possible in order to maximize his advantage, rather than the opposite.

I think the komi / pass idea is a good one, but I suspect it will be quite hard to balance without a considerable number of games to draw upon.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's not a problem. You can use the same protocol as in Loose: the first player sets the komi, then the second player chooses sides.

As Bill Spight explained in L19, half-integer komi is also possible by giving Black a "conditional pass", which he can only use if he passes first. This refinement effectively doubles the precision of the pass komi.

(This conditional pass idea will ring a bell with someone...)
