This does not answer your question, but the half-board TwixT puzzles will
help you understand early situations in TwixT on a small board (if you
haven't already seen this):

If you have the Zillions player program, I'd be happy to try out some small
board openings sometime.

And what about C3 C5?

If next
(D6 or C7) D3
E5 G5

What about G5, is this the only winning move for white?

G5 E5 E4 G6 C7!

And what about B4 C6 E6?

E2 fails to D5
E3 to F4?

Seems difficult to move on to larger boards :)

I asked before (in "move number one in hex") who
wins after a given first move on different places
in hex. Now I'm wondering about Twixt. I'm new to
to this game so please excuse me if my suggested
moves are stupid. But I have become quite
fascinated by it, especially after trying it out
at the MSO. That's why I want to learn more.

So what starting moves are wins for white and
which ones are wins for black on 8x8?

     A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H

       ------------------

As far as I can tell, C3, D3, C4 and D4 are
all wins for white (who plays first and
north-south), while B2, C2, D2, B3 and B4
are wins for black. In particular, black
wins after D2 with D7, and after B4 with C6.

So, is this right? Have larger boards been
completely analyzed w.r.t. the first move?
