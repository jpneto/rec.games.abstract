Hello!

I am interested in information about good games played on a board consisting
of hexagonal pieces (usually Hexagonal shape too). Also I would be
interested in how to get boards for the following games.

One idea I had was to buy Hexagonal shaped wood pieces that can be assembled
to the board depending on the game. War game mats have also struck me as a
candidate but I don't know much about that market.

Below is my list of interesting games so far. Who can add to this list?

X-in a row games: Boku, Hexade
Chess: Glinski's Hexagonal chess and a few more
Connection games: Hex, Havannah, Star, Superstar, Y, Unlur (usually played
on a special board)
Draughts: Hex-emergo (flawed), Hexdame
Gipf series: Gipf, Tamsk, Zertz, Dvonn
Other: Kensington, Medusa, Hive, Zenix, Abalone
Themed: Through the desert, Samurai

regards,
Carl Johan
