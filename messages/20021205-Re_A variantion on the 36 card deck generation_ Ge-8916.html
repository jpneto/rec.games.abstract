<div class="moz-text-flowed">A long time ago we used to do things like that with dice to 
sim multi-siders we didn't have. You would roll a d6 and a 
d10. If the d6 = 1,2, or 3, the d10 roll stood. If the d6 = 
4,5, or 6, you added 10 to the d10 roll, giving yourself a 
flat "20" sider. With 2d6's you could fake a d10. The first 
was low end/high end, while the second was 1-5 (6's rerolled 
due to out of range.) Clunky, but it worked okay when the 
only 10 siders cost $1 a piece, only came as part of a set, 
and then only via a 3-4 week snail mail parcel post. Ahhhh, 
the good old days. ;-)
