Agreed. In any case, the difference between Go and Chess is not that
between east and west, since both are of Asiatic origin. Furthermore,
Chess, in one form or another, remains pretty well the national game of
Asia. While both are equally Asiatic, Wei-qi (the ancestor of Japanese
Go) is more specifically Chinese, so the contrast is between China and
the rest of Asia rather than between Asia and the west. Indeed, until
about the middle of the 19th century "The West" has hardly come up with
any original game of its own.

Oh, there are things more stupid than that, and odds are Mark can
probably mention four or five other things I have written that he
would consider that, and he would likely (with relish) let the world
know it is so :-P  However, I believe it is a valid question to ask,
at least from the perspective of why games like Go (positional
territory control) placement games really never caught on.  The west
went into capture games.  Oh, there is tic-tac-toe, and 9 Men Morris,
but is there anything in the West like Go?  If not, it is important to
ask why here, and see if maybe there is a cultural basis for it, in
how people think.  Maybe the question or hypothesis is wrong, but
hardly the "most stupid thing anyone had heard" (using "stupidest"
rather than "most stupid" might be argued to be more stupid).

In the case of both Chess and Go, some individual was probably messing
around with some equipment which was used for some purpose other than
game playing, and discovered the simple mechanism and principle that
would form the basis of the game.

I should think that this, in one form or another, accounts for the
origin of nearly all games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Odds are the reason is probably more than below.  It likely had to do
with generals and kings trying to use a model to predict the future.
Along the way, they found it fun, and codified it as a game for
training.  Again, the "divination" angle.  Other theory has that they
were derived from gambling games of a sort.

 Something resembling a Go board and
Go stones may have been used for divination.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Possibly. Stewart Culin, the 19th century ethnographer and games
researcher, made great play of the divinatory origin of board and table
games, but I think he went a bit overboard on it. It certainly seems a
likely explanation for Wei-qi, as it is supported by documentary
evidence, but there are many other possible source activities for other
games. Think, for example, of accounting and book-keeping devices, and
surely Mancala owes something to seed or bean planting?

The idea is that the board represented a map with key territories?

What I'm getting around to is that a Chess-like game and a Go-like
game were designed by two different individuals, people found them
entertaining, and the games evolved, probably Chess more so than Go,
while retaining their essential identities.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It may be misleading to think of the origins of traditional board games
in terms of individuals. It is natural for us to do so because we live
in an age that has become extremely conscious of the significance and
importance of individuality. Folk games, like folk tales and folk
dances, are perhaps better regarded as the products of cultures and
communities rather than of individuals.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Chess and others have been evolutionary designs.  They start out and
the community needs to make adjustments to how things are.  Eventually
things settle down until enough people get unsettled with the way
things are and make changes.  With Chess, it was in India, and then
went east and west, and as it went west, the Muslims removed the dice
element, and then the crusaders increased mobility of pieces in order
to make the game play faster.  An interesting not here it is the West
that sees pieces with large mobility.

There are a LOT of questions in here as to why certain games catch on
in a certain area, and which shapes which.  An question in this line,
for example, would be why are pieces in the east more likely to lay
flat and not stand up in 3D.
