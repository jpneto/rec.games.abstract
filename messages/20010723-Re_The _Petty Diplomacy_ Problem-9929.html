I looked at the two pages cited for rules for Faustus and Cerberus.
The rules for Faustus were fairly complete, though I didn't quite
follow how the Archpieces capture.  Do they move an arbitrary
distance in a straight line and then jump one piece and land on
the immediately following space?  Do they move an arbitrary distance
in a straight line but jumping at most one enemy piece (with any
amount of empty spaces before and after it)?  Or what?  The thing
that particularly confused me was the bit about how they can capture
only one piece at a time, but most still capture as many pieces as
possible.  Is that saying that they can do a series of capturing
moves, but each part of the move captures only one piece?  Anyway,
it was unclear.

The "rules" for Cerberus were no more than a brief top-level
description.  No mention of how the pieces move.  (Not even a
link to another game that might've mentioned how they move.)

I apologize for the lack of clarity about the moves.  Unfortunately,
illustrations were not an option. 

To answer your questions, the Archpieces have the "long" moves of Kings in such
Checkers games as Turkish Checkers, Spanish Checkers, International Checkers,
etc.  They can move any distance in a straight line over unoccupied spaces. 
They jump over an enemy piece and then can continue on in a straight line over
any unoccupied spaces.  Just as in regular Checkers, once a piece has jumped an
enemy and is in the posistion to jump another enemy, it continues to do so, but
can't jump over two pieces together.

The pieces in Cerberus move just like their counterparts in Chess.  The only
difference is that because it is a hexagonal board the pieces usually have more
directions to move in.  For example, the rook in HexChess moves in 6 orthogonal
directions rather than the 4 orthogonal directions of regular Chess.

If you're sitll unclear on the moves, it is fairly easy to find websites on
both HexDame and HexChess which are very similiar games.

But at the more abstract level, I don't see how making the goal of
a game be "to lose" really helps solve either of the cited problems.
There will still be cases where one player is threatening victory
unless the other two work together to stop him.  And there will
still be cases where two players are threatening victory, and the
third cannot achieve victory himself but can stop either -- but not
both -- of the other two.

The question isn't do such factors as alliances exist.  The question is do they
exist to the point that they unfairly imbalance the game.

Let's take Faustus for example and remove the Rock/Paper/Scissors relationship
between the players so that it is simply a game of three-player Checkers.  Now
lets say that the Angels acquire an early lead forcing the Wizards and Devils
into alliance against them.  There is no reason for the Wizards and Devils to
stop in their assault 
until the Angels have been wiped off the board.  It becomes obvious early on to
the Angels that they are fighting a lost cause, but must continue to make moves
since they still have pieces on the board.  Faced with a choice of capturing
either the Devils' or the Wizards' piece, they arbitrarily pick the Devils,
effectively ensuring the Wizards' victory.  Any sense of balance or strategic
play has been completely lost.

Now let's look at the same game with the Rock/Paper/Scissors relationship back
in place.  The Angels acquire an early lead forcing the Wizards and Devils into
an alliance.  The Wizards would never continue thier alliance to the point of
wiping the Angels off the board, because all that would do is help the Devils
win while cementing their own defeat.  If the Angels get too weak, the Wizards
will have to jump in and proctect them to stop the Devils from winning. 
Besides, the Wizards need the Angels help to take on the Devils.  From the
Devils point of view,  they know that at any moment the Wizards will turn on
them.  The Angels are the only thing protecting them from the Wizards.  If the
Devils decimate the Angels force too quickly, they will be completely
defenceless against the Wizards and will easily be overrun.  It is in each
players' interest to avoid extremes because it too upsets the balance of power.
  Eventually, the Wizards or Devils will break off their alliance and in turn
form an alliance with the Angels.

Because of this, along with other factors, it is usually not obvious until the
very end that a particular player is doomed to lose.  This minimizes the impact
of the "Kingmaker" problem.  Furthermore, due to the limitations of the
players, they can not make as significant an impact as they would in a regular
game.  Take the example from the first game.  It has now become clear to the
Angels that they have no chance of winning and they choose to help the Wizards
achieve victory.  Except here, the Angels can't capture the Devils pieces
because it impossible for them to do so.  All they can to is lay traps for the
Devils by sacrificing pieces and forcing them into more vulnerable posistions. 
However, the Devils know that any moment the Angels and Devils might form an
alliance against him and will take this into consideration when planning his
moves.  What's more, the very act of the Angels sacrificing pieces, helps the
Devils move closer to victory.

The game does have a balance and there is a strong need for strategic play.
