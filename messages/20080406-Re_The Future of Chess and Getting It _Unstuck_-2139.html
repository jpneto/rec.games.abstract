For the record, when I say that chess is fine the way it is or
that chess isn't broken and does not need fixing, I am referring
to Articles 1 through 14 of the FIDE Laws of Chess as documented
athttp://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE101, except
where those articles assume that every game has an arbiter; two
players need to be able to play a game without outside assistance
and yet still have a defined set of rules.  I have no problem
with different kinds of clocks, tournament scoring systems, rating
schemes, or anything else other than the rules that two players
need to know to play a game against each other.  I also have no
problem with chess variants, or with one of the variants becoming
more popular than chess.  What I object to is someone trying to
change the rules that determine how the game is played.

What team is the world Bughouse Champion and who holds the official
title to World Speed Chess Champion?  Is there any governing body now
that officially has that?  If it isn't FIDE, then there are versions
of chess that aren't being represented, thus the FIDE rules are not
perfect, not even those.

As for how the game is played, Chess has evolved over time, in
different forms.  It adjusted.  When there was seen a lack of
mobility, the Bishop took flight and the Queen became mad.  And chess
adjusted, by adding castling.

What I was saying it isn't a case of one person trying to propose some
variant, but perhaps the chess community as a whole evaluating
everything and having a migration path that won't stiffle any
potential needed changes from happening.
