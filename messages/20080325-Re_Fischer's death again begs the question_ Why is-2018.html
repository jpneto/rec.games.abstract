I doubt it. There are many theorists of chess who can't actually play the

I disagree. Any proof to back this up? And remember, "many," not just
an isolated case or two.

**By all means doubt, Steven. I suppose my proof is my direct experience. 
But I am sure this is not a satisfactory answer to you, since you match my 
generalism with your own general quare on it.

What I mean is that there are 1500 rated players who know more of some lines 
than I do, but who I defeat by move 10 - and I supposed out loud that just 
knowing the lines is not the same as understanding the relative merits of 
the positions.

You would perhaps also accept that theoretical knowledge in chess, or 
anything else, is different from an ability to use that knowledge on demand, 
in a competitive situation?

There is a common joke about teaching creative writing; at tax time, entry 
for Teaching Creative writing = $40,000. Entry for earning from one's 
Creative Writing = $0.
