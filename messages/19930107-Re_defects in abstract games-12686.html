I wouldn't call the "three lives per vertex rule" arbitrary, since it is the
only number of lives per vertex that leads to an interesting game. I.e. let
N-Sprouts be the same game as Sprouts, except that each vertex has N lives.
Then:

  0-Sprouts is uninteresting: it is an immediate loss for the first player.

  1-Sprouts is uninteresting: starting with N spots, the game will always
  last a total of floor(N/2) moves, ending with the spots joined in pairs.

  2-Sprouts is uninteresting: starting with N spots, the game will always
  last a total of N moves. (Outline of proof: at any stage in the game, the
  position consists of a number of chains of 1 or more spots, each with 2
  lives left, plus a number of loops of 1 or more spots, ech with 0 lives
  left. Each move either connects the two endpoints of a chain, converting
  it into a loop, or links two chains into one: i.e. each move reduces the
  number of chains by 1. The game cannot end until there are no chains left,
  since a chain can always be converted into a loop by joining its
  endpoints. So we start with N chains of length 1, lose 1 chain per move
  and must end with no chains: there are therefore N moves.)

  3-Sprouts is interesting, and is the game usually known as Sprouts.

  N-Sprouts for N=4 and above is uninteresting, since they <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>always<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> lead
  to infinite games provided there was at least one initial spot. (After a
  move, the newly created spot can always be connected to itself, so there
  is always another move available.)
