Ok, Logic Man.  So you should probably be able to name one real,

The Richard Hutnik theory?  Is this what we've come to?  This is a
lovely theory, assuming you want to play every game TWICE!!
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth...

Can we once and for all dispense with the horrifically asinine
implication that draw susceptible games such as Stackers are more
"fair" somehow?  You know, the tale that's tirelessly perpetuated by
designers of draw susceptible games?  I know the answer is no, but I
can dream can't I?

How could you possibly not consider the coin toss part of the game?
It's not like two independent events.  Like "Ok Johnny, call it.
Heads or tails.  Ok now, tell you what, Johnny.  Let's play a game
whose rules specify that I'm Player 1 and you're Player 2.  Said move
order designation has nothing to do with that coin I just tossed."

"Oh no, Mark.  You misunderstand me yet again.  As I said earlier, I
was only referencing a special class of games in which... blah blah
blah blah blah."  Do you mind if we float back down to planet Earth
and talk about real games, and real implications for real gameplay?
To me the Richard Hutnik theory doesn't qualify as "substance", and
does nothing to further the progress of what could otherwise be an
intelligent discussion.

Armies don't butt heads in Stackers, as two armies can't block each
other.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Torben, stop evading me.  This is the third time around on this
topic.  In Stackers you've got two opposing armies on opposite sides
of the board with pieces that can only move one square, not like Chess
where a bishop might fly three quarters of the way across the board in
one move, cutting through enemy troops in the process, and easily
facilitating the intermixing of armies.  Can we assume that the two
Stackers armies <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> slowly approach each other and make contact,
creating what may <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>appear<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be a temporary, impasse-like situation?
I'm going to take a leap of faith and assume you're still with me
here.  Neither army is "blocked" in the sense of having no legal
forward moves.  I know that.  BUT, if neither player wants to be the
first to form a mixed stack, AND neither player wants to open a
corridor allowing the enemy to pass through, you've got yourself a
full blown impasse - a lovely example of an unforced draw.

Is the preceding example like two retarded idiots, drooling and
sliding Chess rooks from side to side in place?  No!  In my case, I'm
not a drooling, retarded idiot.  I've played Chess many times and I've
always made some effort to get my pieces out into play.  Nobody had to
teach me that.  It just somehow seemed like the right thing to do.
But in the above described, impasse-like situation in Stackers, I
WOULD NOT WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO FORM A MIXED STACK.  If my opponent,
presumably also not a drooling, retarded idiot felt the same way, we'd
have to agree to a draw!
