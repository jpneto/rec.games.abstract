Some additional information about this:

* I'm fairly certain the name of the author is spelt Berlekamp.

  letterbox this morning. Unfortunately, I left it at home, so can
  only post the details that have stuck in my memory :-(.

The authors of this book on Mathematical Go are Elwyn Berlekamp and
myself (David Wolfe).  It's published by two publishers, and
information is appended.  The book does not describe an efficient
algorithm for Go endgames in a formal sense.  Rather, it describes a
collection of mathematical tools which solve endgame problems which
professionals cannot solve.

The algorithm has been developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and is based on the
temperature theory described in "Winning Ways" by Berlekamp, Conway and
Guy.

Results relating temperature theory to Go were not included in the
book.  These newer results yield heuristics for playing the endgame
provably very well.

P.S. I propose that this be the last message on this thread posted to
rec.games.abstract, and future posts be only to rec.games.go.

Elwyn Berlekamp and David Wolfe.  Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets
the Last Point. A K Peters, Ltd., Wellesley, Massachusetts, 1994.

Paperback has the title --- Mathematical Go Endgames: Nightmares for
the Professional Go Player, Ishi Press International, San Jose, CA.

Ishi also has a software companion which solves the 20 or so problems
in the back of the book.
________________________________________________________________
 From the back cover:

In this unique book, the authors, both amateur Go players themselves,
develop the mathematical techniques for solving late-stage endgame
problems that can stump top-ranking professionals.  As a typical game
of Go approaches its conclusion, the active regions of play become
independent of one another, and the overall board position may be
regarded as a sum of disconnected partial board positions.
Combinatorial game theory, a branch of mathematics Berlekamp helped
develop, has long been concerned with such sums of games.  Here, it is
applied to solving Go-related problems with a bewildering choice of
similar-looking moves and subtle priority relationships.  The theory
presented in this book assigns each active area on the board an
abstract value and then shows how to compare them to select the
optimum move or add them up to determine the ideal outcome.  Some of
the values are familiar numbers of fractions, but most are more bizarre
objects quite unlike anything in the existing Go literature.  From
these abstractions, the reader learns that positions seeming to have
the same numerical value can be crucially different while positions
that appear completely different can be mathematically identical.  A
Go player with an interest in mathematics or a mathematician
interested in Go will not want to miss this book because it describes
substantial connections between the two subjects which have been,
until now, largely unrecognized.
