Dipole, played with a Checkers set, is very strategic and very aggressive.

I checked out the rules, the game sems interesting, but I have
two points to query.

Firstly, the business of keeping checkers in reserve is
very unclear.  How are they removed from the board to
reserve?  How are they returned?  Where to?  Does it
use up a move?  The rules really need to be clarified
substantially on this point.

Secondly, how is it true that there is always a move available
to one side or the other?  If both players move some or all
their stones up to the far end, and there are no captures
available, they can both make no more moves.  What then?

Waiting keenly for elucidation.
