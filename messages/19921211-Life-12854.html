For anyone who's interested in Life, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>strongly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> recommend
FastLife for the Amiga... it's available on a Fish disk. It
comes with some INCREDIBLY complex and amazing patterns.

People have theorized that it would be possible to make a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>computer<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that operated on Life, with streams of gliders
instead of streams of data. It could be done. This is important,
because the rules of Life could actually be the rules of
growth of some kind of bacteria or something. And if so, an
actual <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>living<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> computer could be constructed.

Anyway, FastLife comes with dozens of sample patterns, some
of which could be used in such a computer. A clock circuit.
A divider circuit, which takes a stream of gliders coming in
at regular intervals and releases a stream of gliders coming
1/16th as often. A <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>random number generator<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, for crying out
loud. If you've got an Amiga, get it.
