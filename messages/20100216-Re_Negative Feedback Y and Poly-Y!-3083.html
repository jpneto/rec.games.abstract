I don't think of super stability as being more desirable in a design
than super instability.  Like you don't want the play to blow up in
your face, but you don't want something holding you back either.
There has to be the potential for breaking free.

Agreed, especially with the idea that there must be potential for
breaking free, which I regard as critical - it lends a sense of
variety to a game: some contests end in a quick collapse, some are
nail-biters, etc.  So regulated advantage, or negative feedback, or
whatever you want to call it, is best if it's weak.

I've noticed as well that it tends only to regulate inexperienced
players.  Experienced players can learn to use the subtleties that the
dynamic introduces against their opponents.  I'm thinking especially
of Yinsh here, where much is known.  So it's actually a kind of false
feedback (as long we restrict ourselves to perfect information games -
when you include negative feedback into games with chance it just
multiplies the effects of chance on the outcome of the game).

But that seems like a good thing.  The ideal game sucks in newbies by
giving them a tense experience where they feel like the understand
something about the game, even if, as is the case for most deep games,
they don't.

I don't have any sense of whether the regulation is too strong in
these Y variants.  I'll have more to say when I actually test them.
