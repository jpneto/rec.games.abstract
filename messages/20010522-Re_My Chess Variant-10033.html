Gianni, did you find that defense becomes more difficult since
protected pieces really aren't protected?  Wouldn't one go all out
on the offensive alternating moves among a set of attackers?  Pretty
hard to lose a piece playing offense.  Does the game play as if there's
incomplete information/communication?  If so then having a "play book"
(e.g. unusual opening) becomes really important.

I thought about this,  and it turns out it's not quite true.
Example:  white plays bishop takes knight,  the knight is
"protected" by the pawn.  Black can't immediately recapture,
but white can't move the bishop twice in a row,  so black will
recapture on the next move.

Yes, due to the no-move-a-piece-twice rule, capturing a guarded piece expose
the capturing piece to a recapture.

Eventually, you can try the game downloading the .zrf file from this page:

Thanks to Peter Aronson (and Steve Tavener, author of a previous version)
for the Zrf implementation.
