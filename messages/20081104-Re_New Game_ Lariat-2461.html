But may I stress again, Mark, as others have done; without intending
offense, that figures 1, 2 &amp; 3 are unnecessarily inviting people to
make the mistake, and should perhaps be deleted altogether
from the page.  It would mean extending those diagrams
with extra "flanges" like the main diagram, fig 5, has,
so more work for you, but they needn't extend the full distance,
just enough to show the nature of things.

Well, enough people have had trouble with the origami cylinder that I
don't want to derail readers before they even get going.  I think it's
best to present the lariat principle and get that established, and
then bump it onto a cylinder.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Anyway, it's obviously not at all certain yet, what the appropriate
ratio between cap-size and cylinder length should be, to make it
a fair game, and would need a lot of playing to determine this.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes that is certainly true.  But I think some observations can be made
at this point.  There should be a range.  Like the ratio of (radius +
length)/circumference should be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>at least<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> x to make the "key" cell
strategically undesirable as a first or second move.  More
specifically, (radius + length) should be larger than the
circumference.  That's the main thing.  Then the cylinder shouldn't be
excessively long just because the outer reaches probably won't be used
and you end up wasting screen real estate.

The whole point of applying the lariat principle to a cylinder was to
make the end, center cell no more valuable than any other cell -
certainly not "key".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sure, I see the point of that now.       It is still a "special" cell
OC,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, in an academic sense but not in a strategic sense.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
but that's inevitable because of the win criterion.  It is also worth
noting, though scarcely important, that there are also some other
special cells - those six at the top of the cylinder that have only
5 neighbors rather than the usual six.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, interesting in an academic sense.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Presumably this makes
them very marignally less valuable, though I doubt it would be
all that detectable in play, any more than it is in Projex etc.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I have to strongly disagree with you there, Bill.  Lariat isn't even
distantly related to Hex beyond the fact that they're both connection
games played on a hexagonally tessellated board,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, that "beyond" rather effectively destroys the force
of your "distantly related",
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

:D yeah I know.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
but it's not worth arguing about.
Certainly your game is a lot further from Hex than I first thought.

Also, I agree with your comments about large-scale equalisations
as in Unlur - they give a game a completely different tone.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
...
I know you like to present a "completed effort", but without either
equalisation or experimentation, this is a forlorn hope.

Anyway, keep up the good work; and I was charmed by your
account of inventing games, focus, etc.  It's not the way I do it,
but it's obviously a good way.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The real excitement for me at the outset is the discovery.  Prudence
would dictate a quick test run on a small board but I just can't.
It's torture.  Even if I had someone to test it out with, which I
don't, it'd still be torture.  Kind of like trying to light a wet
joint in a strong wind with a depleted lighter - and cold fingers.
