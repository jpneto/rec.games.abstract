[Disclaimer:  I'm <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a strong player, but Joel Feinstein, frequent
British champion and author of a strong program, is;  and I have done
some work with Joel on developing his program.  Joel is currently away,

	What do you call "interesting"?  6x6 is completely solved, and
anything much larger might as well be the complete game!

	Joel's program doesn't use transposition tables.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> think they
would help, but Joel isn't convinced.  Certainly they are much less use
than in chess or go, where it is common for any permutation of a move
sequence to lead to the same position.  It "sort-of" uses killers, but
in a rather convoluted way [they affect move ordering].

if there's a corner move, take it; otherwise try all the moves in
numerical order (like a TV scan across the board).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	Joel's program has a rather devious permutation method;  the "raw"
numerical order is not just left-to-right, top-to-bottom, but involves
a pre-determined sequence that visits interesting squares first.  This
sequence evolves as some moves become killers and others are "used up".

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Oddly, this degraded the tree-searching performance dramatically from
just leaving the moves in numerical order, although it of course ends up
with the same result.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	I found the same when fiddling with Joel's program!  Even when
he and I were both agreed that something should be an improvement, it
actually always made things worse.  I conclude that his program is
evolutionarily stable against small changes.  This applies both to
move ordering and to positional evaluations.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Could a human Othello player comment on this?  I thought perhaps retaining
the threat of moving into a corner might be more effective than grabbing
it immediately; does this correspond to a known human strategy?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	I can't comment usefully in the case of Othello, but the equivalent
is well-known in chess:  "The threat is stronger than the execution!".
