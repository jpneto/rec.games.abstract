Recently I posted at r.g.c about why I left: It's has the atmosphere
of a dog pack that has been upset by a couple of stray wolves and one
ot two got bitten. Now they've retreated to a safe place and are all
excited to get back at them.

--------------------
"That site needs to be completely deserted before
we can build anew. I don't discourage anyone from spamming
rec.games.abstract or trolling Steere, activities which I will
continue to engage in, hehe."
--------------------

And a very mature engagement it has been: depicting Mark as a
pedophile, as Hitler, announcing his death, and the like.

Or this:
--------------------
"&gt; That site needs to be completely deserted before we can build anew

I don't think rga is ever going to be clean - steere will haunt it
for ever, checking in once in a while to make sure nothing
gets past him. That guy is one sad cookie!

I don't discourage anyone from ... trolling Steere.

It is my goal in life now."
--------------------

What I said, a dog pack.
I like <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>dogs<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to behave like dogs, not people. If you feel driven out
of a public forum, I can imagine you would object. But you have your
own place now, so logically one would assume that now the polite
exchange of ideas you aspire to can take place uninterrupted.

But no, the other site "needs to be completely deserted before we can
build anew".

We, we, we, oh cosiness, oh resentfulness, oh cowardness.
Why please does this place need to be "completely deserted" to start
the polite exchange of ideas you aspire to. And even if, isn't
ignoring it the best way?

Yet there may be something to it: not much is happening at r.g.c.
indeed. And not much will, I fear, as long as Mediocrity loves
Company.
