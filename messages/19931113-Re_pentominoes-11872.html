This "scaled up" puzzle reminds me of one of my favorite problems using
hexominoes (6 squares, flat).  There are 35 hexominoes, so I tried
setting aside one piece, then using 9 pieces to build a copy scaled up
by 3, then using the remaining 25 to build a copy scaled up by 5.
A "checkerboard pattern" argument shows that solutions cannot exist
for 24 of the 35 pieces, but I found solutions for the other 11.

A company called Spear's Games published a set of hexominoes under the
name Spear's Multipuzzle (it came with a 6 by something frame and a
booklet listing various subsets of pieces to try to fit in the frame),
but that was about 20 years ago so I have no idea if it still exists.

I also agree with the poster (sorry, I forget who) who said there are
29 pentacubes.  The 17 non-planar figures are shown below, where x is
a cube in plane 0, * is a cube in plane 0 with a cube on top of it in
plane 1, and + is a cube in plane 1 with nothing beneath it.  Which
shape is the German company omitting?

  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>x  x<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>  xx  xx  x*  xx  xx   x   x   *  *    x  x   +    +  *x  *x
   x   x   *   x  x   *   x   x*  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>x  xx  xx  x<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>x  *x  x<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>   *  xx
   x   x   x   *  x   x   *    x   x  x    x  x    x   x  x

Hm, I wonder if by omitting one shape they were able to obtain a
copyright?  I.e., the concept of "all shapes you can form from 5 cubes"
is not new, but the decision to omit one particular shape is?
