Well, if you have the same xlife I have, I don't know how much of
a "game" it is.  Basically what happens is: the board is initialized
with a random set of patterns.  You start it, and things come alive
and die quickly and continually. Your objective is to kill all life
by using the cursor (magic wand) to magically make cells come alive.
Once you figure out how to 'tickle' most of the patterns
(there are a few "stable" ones which crop up all the time),
the game is rather tedious.  I guess you could have
competitions to see who does it quicker, but it takes a bit
of time to clear the board (tedious!).

Most fun is designing neat beginning patterns (such as the glider
posted earlier).  Here's one I didn't design (got it from the 
sunview version of life).  It continually creates gliders.
Actually quite amazing.  You have to see it to believe it.

(This is in xlife format - each line is an x-y cordinate in a 2d grid.
Comment lines start with a # and comment lines are required to separate
patterns (there's only one pattern here, tho').  Also the file must
terminate with a comment line (as shown here).)
