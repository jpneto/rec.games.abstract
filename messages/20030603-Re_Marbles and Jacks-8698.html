Isn't the purpose of marbles to "win" your opponents' marbles? In that
regard, it's not unlike the Pog craze of the 90's or even Pokemon, for that
matter. Closer to Pogs, though, I'd guess as it's a game of manual
dexterity.

Jacks is more of a solitaire game, I think. You're trying to pick up more
and more on each bounce, right?

All in all, I'd much rather play chess or go :)

do with either. And as best as I can now recall, neither did my
friends/classmates/neighbors. When I'd ask an adult I'd get a vague one
sentence explanation. Respectively, "Use the shooter to hit the other
marbles" and  "Jacks?: you pick them up."  That was of no help. The
different types of marbles (cat eyes, the big shooters, etc.) were
interesting to look at, but after 5 minutes of that I was bored. And the
little red ball that came with the metal jacks always got lost. And

Anyway, it was over 25 years later before I was enlightened on both games.
And when that occurred my reaction was, "how dull", even for a child (of

I don't know, but I'm guessing these were holdovers toys from the Great
Depression. My parents and theirs peers grew up during that time. And I
suppose they bought these toys not because they were good, but because

had them as children (when you were lucky to have anything). Why these
toys/games are still being sold in 2003 beats me.

When was the last time you saw anyone play marbles or jacks, by the rules?
Yes, they really have rules (that was one of the things I didn't know for
decades).
