I discovered a grain of sand in the machinery of Cyclix. It comes with
the territory: chess variants are exercises in arbitrariness to begin
with. They're usually mechanical rather than organical. They don't
come together, you have to put the elements together like a
watchmaker.

Playing around with it, Cyclix turned out the be something of a
streetfight. You hit a lot and take a lot, and things can become
rather chaotic. Close combat, an unclear strategy, except maybe in
very general terms, lots of tactical leverage and lots of sacrifices.
That's to be expected when the pieces are immediately returned to the
player making the 'sacrifice'.

At a certain point I noticed that the pieces were hampered by the
increasing number of holes. The holes are meant to hamper the king -
that's the whole 'Atlantis' idea. They may hamper pieces to a degree,
and they do in Shakti.
But not in Caïssa, where a piece may carry its tile along to land on a
square that doesn't have one - the problem isn't new and the choice
may go either way, depending on the nature of the interacting
elements.

The Cyclix king is stronger than Shakti's, because in Shakti a king in
check is restricted to adjacent squares. But Shakti's pieces are less
in number and not too strong either. So I had already decided not to
restrict Cyclix' king that way.

The Cyclix king is also more often forced to take a piece that gives
check because pieces are easily and readily 'sacrificed' for instance
to force a king to 'draw holes' around itself. But that may not always
affect the king's escape routes negatively, and at a certain point the
number of holes may hamper the pieces to a degree that feels annoying,
especially if the king finds a long jump as a loophole.

So with the implicit exception of the king, I've given pieces the
right to take along the tile they occupy if moving to a square that
doesn't hold one, as in Caïssa. It gives the pieces greater
flexibility and introduces new tactical goals, for instance 'stealing'
tiles close to the opponent's king.
