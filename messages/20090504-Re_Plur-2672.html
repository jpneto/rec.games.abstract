Hi, Nick,

I have noted that you tend to use an unnecessarily complicated tie-
break rule in your game rules ideas: "if there is a tie, compare the
2nd largest group (or whatever), if still a tie compare the 3rd," etc.
I think a more simple solution, which would by the way eliminate draws
completely, could be this one:

If there is a tie, the last player to have a winning score in a
previous position of the game wins. Or, what is the same: if there is
a tie, the player who has scored last (whatever it means in a certain
game) loses. If none of the players have scored along the game, the
player who has not made the first move of the game wins.
