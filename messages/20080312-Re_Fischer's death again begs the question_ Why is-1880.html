If White has a slight advantage, then Black could get slightly more

Any scheme that awards less than a half point for a draw just
encourages players in drawn positions to toss a coin to decide who
resigns.  Players operating this strategy would score, on average,
half a point from every drawn position they entered and would, on
average, score more in tournaments than players who just agreed a
draw.

Even assuming the players don't collude, it seems more likely than
anything else that, with perfect play, chess is a draw.  It seems
wrong to penalize players for achieving what may well be the natural
result of a well-played game.
