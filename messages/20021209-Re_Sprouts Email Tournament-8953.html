I hope this diatribe has been a reasonable answer to your question!

My first take on the game as described at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.geocities.com/chessdp">www.geocities.com/chessdp</a> was
"ack, a fancy version of Nim!"  On the other hand, I don't find too many
people to be as worthwhile as Martin Gardner with respect to what I may find
interesting, and for him to have devoted columnar inches to the game was a
strong indication that I should think about it for a little while.  I did
this, and even without reading your reply to Mr. Wedd, I was able to
formulate my conclusion--strategy in Sprouts is subtle but undeniable, and
more interesting to me than Nim's (but that's almost like saying a dog is
more playful than a dead wasp).

The interesting topological dilemmas might make me want to play Sprouts some
number of times, even if the game were absolutely tactical in nature.  While
I do think I'd rather play Arimaa or Dvonn or any number of abstract games
far more frequently than I'd want to play Sprouts, I am impressed with your
obvious commitment to the game, and wish you luck in promoting interest in
it.

One thing that irks me, though--the notion that I saw mentioned somewhere
that every turn two liberties get utilized, but only one gets added, so the
game must eventually end:  Every turn THREE liberties are added to the pool;
two are utilized; gaining a net of one liberty.  Without clear understanding
of the restrictions that topology may impose, it could appear to be
interminable.....
