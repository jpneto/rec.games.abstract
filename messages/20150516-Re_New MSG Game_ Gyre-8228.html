I'm not sure if you do, Luis.  Twice you mentioned occupying the center cell which is neither necessary nor sufficient to win at Gyre, as is readily apparent from Figures 1 and 4.

I'm aware of that. What I'm saying (please correct me if I'm wrong) is that playing Free Y on a hexhex board and considering ties as wins for the player who occupies the center cell yields Gyre. Of course you don't need to occupy the center cell if your winning chain is a win in Free Y as well, which should be most of the time.

this is Free Y with the provision that a tied game (impossible in 
that game thanks to the odd number of perimeter cells) is considered 
a win for the player who occupies the center cell.

That's like saying a bird is a monkey with wings and feathers.  As I said, it's a narrow class of games.  I.e., they're going to have a lot in common.

That's true, and Gyre is a legitimate contribution to that class.
