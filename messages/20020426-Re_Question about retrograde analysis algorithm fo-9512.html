The following is what I've worked out:

Define the EGTB as an array of unsigned char. Each element has one of 3 types of meanings:
(1) 255: Unknown
(2) 254: Draw
(3) 0-254 : number of ply to mate

Step 1: First pass mark all the stalemates as 254, all the mates as 0 and the remainder as 255 for now.

Step 2: For the next pass over all the elements if the current element is 255 (unknown) make all the legal moves for the
corresponding position and look them up in the table. For all the ones that are mate, select the shortest mate of these. Add 1 to
the mate score and store in the table for the current element. If all of them are 254, mark the current element as 254.

Step 3: Repeat step 2 until a pass is made without making any changes to the table.

Now you have a complete EGTB for a particular type of ending. All the positions that remain with a value of 255 are draws or are
"broken", but for purposes of interpreting 255 when looking up a position legally arrived at, the 255 is interpreted as a draw only.
All the positions with a value of 254 are draws. The remainder give the DTM (=Distance To Mate).

A legal move can be a capture, so such positions must be looked up in another EGTB table.

The reason why we bother with marking positions with 254 as draws is to speed things up. Otherwise, you can simplify further by
ignoring this.

There are no complications with repetition of position and the 50 move rule is ignored.

Even this version of the retrograde analysis algorithm doesn't handle
the case in an abstract game if repetition draws from different
positions have different values.  This is not relevant in chess since
all positions ultimately have a value of -1 (loss), 0 (draw) or 1
(win).  But imagine a case where you get 0.5 points if you draw when
you have a certain position, but -0.5 points if you draw in another
position...
