Hi!  I'm the inventor of Mind Ninja.  Mark and I have discussed Mind
Ninja privately, so I'm not going to talk about it here, but I do want
to say something about Y.  There is a sense in which Y includes Hex.
After the first few moves in a game of Y, you can end up with a
position such that the remainder of the game is exactly a game of
Hex.  So, the Hex decision tree is embedded in the Y decision tree, as
a subgame under certain circumstances.  I wish I had a link to picture
of this situation, but I don't.  According to the set-theoretic
definition of "generalization", Y can be considered a generalization
of Hex.  Whether it's an interesting generalization is up for
debate.

That seems to be what this debate is really about: whether or not
certain generalizations are more interesting than others.  One thing
Mark is right about: the definition of generalization that I use is
very, uh, "general".  Whopper 100 is a generalization by the set-
theoretic definition, and an extremely uninteresting one at that.
There is no requirement that a generalization be interesting.  But of
course, we game designers who claim that our games are generalizations
are really trying to imply that there is something interesting about
our games!  That's publicity!

Here's the set-theoretic definition of "generalization":

B is a generalization of A if all the instances of A are included in
B, and B contains some instances not in A.

Note that there is no reference to "shared properties" in this
definition.  Of course the only generalizations that will matter to us
are those that are defined by shared properties that we care about.
