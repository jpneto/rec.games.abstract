Hmm, well, then maybe I misinterpreted what you said.  Here's what you
actually wrote:

If you didn't mean that games with a sim-mov mechanism are "far
superior" to games with randomizers, then in what way <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> you think
the sim-mov mechanism is "far superior to randomness"?

Yeah, Diplomacy and Candyland would also be valid examples.  So, do you

Sorry if my misinterpretation caused that.  Frankly, I was really
hoping you did consider one pair of those games superior to the other
pair, because I'd have liked to hear why.  To me it's a pretty
interesting thought.

I mean, there have been (and probably still are) people who take games
like Snakes &amp; Ladders or The Royal Game of Goose very seriously,
perhaps considering one of those the classiest game in the world.  Only
a few years ago, I saw Snakes &amp; Ladders (aka Chutes &amp; Ladders)
advertised in a New-Age catalog as a time-honored tool for getting in
sync with cycles of karma &amp; reincarnation.  It wasn't presented as a
children's game at all.  So, while some of us regard randomizers as
signs of inferiority in a game, others see it the other way around.
Serious S&amp;L fans might very well look down their noses at the likes of
chess, checkers, and go, considering those games mere mental exercises.

Similarly, there's the ancient game of Senet.  Was it just a plaything
tossed into the pharaoh's tomb for fun?  Or might it have been
something sacred?

Since we're talking "classy" in this thread, well--you can't get much
classier than "sacred."
