Except when there is, apparently.

Trisq 2.0 is less similar to Tripen than Atoll is to Eight-Sided Hex, invented by Larry Back (who also invented Onyx) in 2001, as described in Cameron Browne's well-known book <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Connection Games: Variations on a Theme<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. Eight-Sided Hex was first published in the 5th issue (spring 2001) of the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Abstract Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> magazine, as a part of Larry Back's article "Three Hex variants".

Literally, Atoll is to Eight-Sided Hex what Hex is to Grand Hex. In Eight-Sided Hex, the board sides are divided into eight alternating black and white segments, as in Atoll. The game is won by the player who connects either two pairs of his goal areas or at least three of his goal areas. Draws and races are not possible.

Trisq 2.0 has three rules different from Tripen (topology, placement restriction rule, double moves); Atoll has two rules different from Eight-Sided Hex (winning condition, board shape).

Also, Trisq is a new solution to the dreaded deadlock problem on the square grid, while Tripen adds an interesting complication to a perfectly working, more elegant game.
