You should post such items at RGC unless you are trying
to throw Mark Steere a rope so he can get out of the gallows. If that
is the case, I have no control over it but please be upfront about it. ;)

I see no reason why not to be upfront and I don't feel any need to
identify myself or choose sides. I will post wherever I see fit,
mainly depending on what subject matter is at hand. Experience tells
me that not everything I say is received as it is intended, and just
telling how I go about inventing games has on occasion caused hostile
reactions, because it doesn't comply with some people's ideas of how
that should be done.
Claims I made have been exaggerated grossly for the sole purpose of
ridiculing them, a prize for being upfront.
So I'm reluctant to post any insights that are not in reply to an
existing thread, at a forum full of members most of which I don't
know. And since most of them have left this one, it's quite safe
here :)

Which isn't to say that won't post at r.g.c, I have no reason not to,
but I don't want to appear intusive by sharing unsolicited insights
all over the place.
