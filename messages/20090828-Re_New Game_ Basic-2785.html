I once suggested a variant of Othello where each piece has a cross on it
which can be oriented either as and X or as a + (which influences in
which directions it can be the endpoint of a flip) and where the player
that places or flips a piece decides the oriention.  This will greatly
increase the size of the game tree, as each square now has five
different possible values instead of three.  It also greatly increases
the branching factor, which was the primary concern: Othello is great
for computers due to the low branching factor (which makes deep
brute-force search possible), so by increasing this, I hoped to bring
humans into the competition again.

Has this variant ever been played? In anger? It sounds very interesting.

I tried a test game against myself, and I wrote up the tree for the
first five moves to compare the size with the normal Othello opening
tree (the new was larger, but I don't recall by how much).  It seems to
add a nontrivial tactical element, but it also makes moves take much
longer, as you have to consider how to orient the flipped pieces.  It
seems easier to make the opponent pass, but harder to wipe the opponent
out.  But, since these experiences are based on a single solo play, I
can't draw strong conclusions.
