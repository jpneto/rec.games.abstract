   The game still looks to have a first player win if the right
strategy is used.  In your example, the first player need only change
the strategy slightly.  If the second player moves, build one wall above
him, and if he builds a second wall, move yourself.  The second player
can then also move, but eventually will run into a previously built
wall.  As an example, assume the first two turns are as depicted above.
Then have both players build a wall, and then the first player moves.
The situation then looks like this:

. . . . .
    O  |
. . . ._.

. . . . .

._. . ._.
 |    X
. . . . .

   The first player is again in the advantageous position, with one
fewer walls and one more free space in the horizontal direction.  If the
second player also moves, build another wall above him (or her), if the
second player doesn't move build another wall to one side (preferably
the left this time, restricts movement more).  Have fun!

Yes- I discovered this the other day.  The key for X is to keep
moving in this case: if he keeps moving next to O, he can force a
draw.  If O builds a wall between them, then O loses the wall
advantage. (X should move in this case.)

In a couple of email conversations, it's been noted that larger boards
make this game <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>worse<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>: if X can't hinder O`s movement with his piece,
X is at a serious disadvantage.  I thought about adding a rule that
the player who moves second always gets one last wall placement, so
each side ends up with the same number of turns.  This seems to always
lead to a draw barring horrible play.
