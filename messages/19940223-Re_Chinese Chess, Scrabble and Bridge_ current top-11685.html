For my Ph.D thesis, I have investigated (the literature on) a large
number of strategic games. For most games I have been able to obtain
all the information I need, except for Chinese Chess, Scrabble and Bridge.

I would appreciate any pointers to information regarding the following;

2. The state-of-the-art in Scrabble. Here I have heard rumors both that
  the strongest programs outperform human players, as well as rumors that
  the strongest humans still have the edge.
  Which programs are currently considered to be the best.

 From what I've heard, I think state-of-the-art in Scrabble focuses
 mostly on offense, not on defense.

This was true until the release of Maven software last year.  (The program's
author always seems to say "Maven software" rather than just "Maven"; I follow
his lead.)  In any event, it's a lot easier to write programs that play good
offense than programs that play good defense.

   I've heard claims to the effect of

 "This program averages 375 points per game" - well, it sure wouldn't
 be able to get that total against me! 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I would guess (and consider myself very well qualified to guess) that Maven
software would average over 400 points against the world's best player if
he used his normal style of play (in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary.)

   I'm not saying I'd beat it, I
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 probably wouldn't, but it is quite easy to hold the totals down.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Not as easy as you think, if one uses a dictionary as permissive as the
Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (as in North America) or Chambers (as in
the UK).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 My point is, it would be quite possible for a Scrabble program to be
 able to claim a higher average than is seen in human tournament play, and
 yet still lose to strong human players.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is certainly true.  More generally, an average score doesn't mean much
of anything unless one specifies the competition.  Even then it's not an
ideal indicator because of varying styles of play, not to mention the
question of which dictionary one uses.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 I think the best Scrabble programs use a 1-move lookahead, with heuristics
 (like, Don't leave an open triple score) for defense rather than a 
 search.

Again, this was true before the release of Maven software.  This software
has a special module to do late-game analysis (with fewer than 10 tiles in
the bag) and another for end-game analysis (no tiles in bag).  The former 
finds all possible plays using the remaining tiles and tries to make moves
that block the opponent's possible large plays, and the latter does
the sort of endgame analysis one is familiar with from, say, chess.
(Incidentally, in the latest issue of his newsletter <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Rack Your Brain<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>,
the author of his program says that it took him a year to write the first
version of the endgame player.  This may explain why Scrabble programmers
have focused on offense.)

Also, Maven software has the capacity to do Monte Carlo "simulations" of
Scrabble positions, though it does not use these simulations to decide its
moves in a game situation.

In answer to the original question, I would say that about 3-5 humans in
the world can (over a long period) break even or better against Maven
when the dictionary of reference is the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary.

my N[ational] S[crabble] A[ssociation] rating is not much lower than theirs.
I have no affiliation with the programmer of Maven software except as a 
satisfied reader of his newsletter.  I have worked with middling-late 
pre-release versions of Maven, but only minimally with the version 
commercially released.  I'll be happy to send the address from which Maven
