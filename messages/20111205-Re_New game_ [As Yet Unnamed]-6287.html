Of course, but whether that's the rule or the exception depends mainly
on the piece density. In the set-up I suggested, there are as many
vacant points as occupied ones, which in the handful of games I've
played was enough to win by connection. In several ones, some groups
were temporarily locked off, but the winner was able to free them
again in due time, usually making a profit in the process. Certainly,
this doesn't mean every well-played Ayu game will be won by
connection, but not stalemating your opponent is also part of the
game's strategy.
