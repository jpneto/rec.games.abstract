Patrick,

Thanks for writing what turned out to be an interesting topic to read, at
least for me.

I urge you to take a much closer look at backgammon.

Well, thank <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for your interesting contribution to this thread.
Funny you should bring up backgammon again (even though it's probably
off topic for this group).  At times I've thought of it as "my game."

Backgammon first caught my attention in the 1970s, when it rose
phoenix-like out of obscurity and became a new craze.  I started seeing
backgammon sets in catalogs, and I wondered about the game.  I
remembered seeing the rules in a paperback Hoyle, but I'd never played
it.  So, I learned--and I liked it; it was a pretty fun game.

I've owned a few backgammon books, and years ago I played in an online
tournament or two (even came in second in one, IIRC).

First of all, I too love games, specifically abstract strategy games.  My
favorite game is probably chess... been a fan since 1972.  I own more chess
books (300+) and more chess magazines (1000+?) than I have room for.  I've
entered more than 40 tournaments in the past dozen or so years, and would
enter more often if I didn't currently have to work weekends.

I also love checkers, go, Twixt, Abalone, Connect-4, Pente, Amazons, hex,
Quoridor and dozens and dozens of other abstract strategy games, many of
which you've probably never even heard of.

So far, you haven't named one that I haven't heard of.  :)

Not only do I love PLAYING them, I love STUDYING them.

Us chess players are fortunate... (at least most of us.)  We can be just as
happy playing chess as are studying the game, or enjoying a previously
played game or simply reading about chess, etc.

And yet, ask any football player if he enjoys practicing football (a
scrimmage) or actually playing/participating in a football game.  999 out of
1,000 players are probably going to say "playing."  In fact, most probably
strongly dislike the practice and the drills!  They want to PLAY!

I own 100+ books on poker, 40+ books on backgammon, numerous books on
Scrabble, checkers, go, etc.  I truly enjoy practicing and attempting to
improve my knowledge of these games as much as I enjoy playing them.  Rare,
probably, I agree... but it's who I am.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Me too--sort of.  But it sounds to me like you're a lot more analytical
than I am.  I enjoy working my way through a book, reading about a
tactic and then doing a few exercises to drive the point home.  But
while I'm doing that, my mind wanders into metaphorical realms, where
I'm musing over thoughts like what this particular game tactic might
symbolize or how it ties in with military battlefield tactics.  Soon
I'm thinking about all kinds of other things besides the game itself.
Indeed, I often think of the game itself as just a kind of metaphor for
life.  I look for meaning in it.

Mind you, I don't work too hard at doing that.  Nor do I often find the
kind of meaning I'm looking for.  In the end, I usually just shrug and
say, "Oh well, it's just a game."  All I'm saying is that it's my
nature to interpret and wonder about things that way.  And it's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
so much in my nature to analyze or calculate meticulously.

I mention backgammon because that's my latest addiction.  Lately, playing or
studying about backgammon is how I spend most of my free time.  There is a
LOT of information out there from the numerous backgammon sites, backgammon
articles, books, magazines, etc.

I don't know how much you know about backgammon but please note... there is
a LOT less "luck" involved than you might think. Oh sure, luck plays a
role... over the short-run.  For a short match, a beginner could even beat a
master.  But over the long-run, over the course of a long match, over the
course of many, many games, the amateur/beginner isn't going to stand a
chance against a strong player.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, I do know that much.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
That can actually be an advantage over chess.  By that, I mean this...
unless you and your opponent are somewhat evenly matched, a chess game
between the two of you probably won't be much fun... the stronger player is
going to always win.  But the difference in skill between two backgammon
players can be greater, and yet both can still have fun and enjoy a game
together.

One big disadvantage in attempting to master Nine Men's Morris, or Amazons,
or some of the other abstract strategy games you and others have mentioned,
is the lack of tournaments and players.  How many Twixt tournaments are held
regularly here in the United States?  How may hex tournaments?  At least
with backgammon and chess, (and Scrabble, too) is that there ARE tournaments
you can enter... there IS a vast library on the subject... there ARE a great
number of players who will be available to play a game with you both online
and off.

I think it would be quite unfortunate, in a way, to master "Game X"  and
then have no one to play with, simply because "Game X" is not a very popular
game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've often thought the same thing.  But in my case, it may be a moot
point.  I'm drawn to popular games for the reason you give above--I'm
thinking that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>someday<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> I may be playing this game against a real, live
human being; and I ought to maximize the chances of that happening.
But knowing myself as I do, I'm really more likely to spend all my time
studying games or just practicing alone on the computer--and I may
never get around to sitting down to a game with another person (online
or off).

I know that for many people, game playing is above all a social
activity.  But I live such an insular life (and usually like it that
way) that to me there's little difference between games and puzzles.

Still, I must admit it's hard for me to get interested in a game that
few people play.  When I play a game that's been popular for centuries,
throughout many cultures, and still enjoys widespread popularity today
in my own country (the USA), I feel I'm involved in something big and
significant--and that there's a good chance I'll sit down and play a
"real" game someday.  That does a lot to help keep me motivated.

The more I find out about backgammon (and I've been playing it for many,
many years) the more I realize how little I knew.  To those who don't play,
or who know little about the game, yes it's a racing game and yes, the
person who bears off all his or her checkers off first is the winner, but
there is MUCH room for strategy and maneuvering.  It's much more than just a
racing game, where the one who throws the higher numbers on the die is the
winner.  In fact, you don't always want to hit your opponent, (and send him
back) you don't always want to roll high numbers... (which may ruin your
timing).  Depending upon the initial rolls of the dice and how the game
develops, you can get into a running game, a priming game, a holding game, a
back game.  And I won't even get into the entire aspect about the
intricacies of the doubling cube, which is an skill and an art all by
itself.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yep, there's a lot to it alright.  I haven't delved as deeply as you
have, but I've at least scratched the surface.

But OTOH, backgammon is basically a gambling game--and that puts it in
a whole different category, IMO, from games like chess and checkers.
See this article by Bob Newell; it pretty well says what I mean:

Just from the few posts you've written, concerning your age and past
history, I can say with near certainty that you will probably never master
chess... the road is just too long and the mountain too high.  Sorry.  But
even at your age you CAN master backgammon; you don't have a mountain in
front of you, just an incredibly large hill!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A pretty tough, slippery hill, I'll bet.  I'm not at all sure I'd be
able to master any game other than, say, tic-tac-toe.  I wouldn't even
aspire to mastery in any of the "deep" games we've been discussing
here.  I might fantasize about turning out to be a "child prodigy" at
some game--just having a natural aptitude for it that sends me
skyrocketing into the highest ranks.  But that "natural aptitude" thing
is almost always just a fantasy.

Thanks for the encouragement, though.  It's kinda cool to think that I
might actually be able to master backgammon.

Even to me, a chess player at heart, one who loves chess and always will,
backgammon is the more exciting of the two games.  (It actually hurts to
type that... but it's true.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That reminds me of a quote I read long ago (I forgot who by):  "Chess
is the most exciting game in the world."  I'm sure that's true to chess
aficionados, but it must sound very odd to most people, considering
that chess <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>looks<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> like a very boring game to the uninitiated.

Backgammon is usually faster paced, and the dice guarantee surprises
and demand flexibility.  I'm sure those features make it more exciting
from a certain viewpoint.

But then again, some people are more excitable than others.  My dad
used to like to go to Reno and shoot craps; and there's an awful lot of
excitement there.  Horse racing is also very exciting to those who are
into it, apparently.

I guess I'm the kind of person who appreciates "deep" or "meaningful"
more than "exciting."  (But I still much prefer exciting to boring.)

I recently attended (attended, not entered since I had to work) the
California State Backgammon Championships held this past weekend.  I'm
currently playing online at several different backgammon sites.  I'm playing
backgammon live with a friend at work.  I'm currently having loads of fun
analyzing positions with the super strong neural net backgammon programs
that exist.  I'm re-reading old backgammon books and purchasing new ones.
I'm about to drop $400.00 for a large, wood, tournament-size backgammon set
from Gammon Village.  Lately I just can't get enough of the game... and this
is from someone who likes abstract strategy games... games of SKILL.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good for you!  Sounds like a great hobby and a lot of enthusiasm there.

As I said at the beginning of this post, there have been times when I
thought backgammon was "my game."  Periodically I'd get tired of
straining my brain over chess, and then I'd look for alternatives.
Backgammon was one alternative that stuck (another was cribbage).  It
just looked and felt right, and it suited me somehow.  The dice seemed
to take the edge off competition (though I still felt all the
nail-biting tension of competition when I played in tournament games).

A downside to me is the doubling cube.  It's a great feature and adds
subtle strategic (and psychological) depth--but it also means that
quite often a game goes unfinished.  One player gives up, and nobody
ever knows what would have happened if the game had continued.  I'm not
sure, though, whether that bothers me more than the fact that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>without<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
the cube backgammon sometimes gets so lopsided that it's not worth
playing through.
