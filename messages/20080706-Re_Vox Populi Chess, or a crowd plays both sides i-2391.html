Normally I will want the side I am on to win the game.  If I believe my
understanding of the position is greater than that of my team-mates, I
will of course vote for what I think is the best move.  But generally I
won't believe this, and should then abstain.

Things are more interesting if I plan on switching sides after this
move.  So I want the side I am voting with to pick a bad move.  How
should I go about this?  If I just vote for a very bad move, it won't
get it selected.  I have to look for a bad move which might plausibly be
selected.

The top voted on move should be for a side.  If the top move sucks, it
means most people are set to defect.  The idea is supposed to be you
decide to switch after both sides made their moves.  If the teams
consist of small numbers, where you get to politic for a certain move
to take place, I do see looking for a plausible bad move would be a
possibility.  However, if there are large numbers in it, I am not sure
how effective that is.  Also, what I am proposing is the top vote
getter (or top 3 or 4 with the most popular one on top) is shown at
all times.  People may just gravitate around the first one, if it
seems sound.

I do believe more work is needed here though, which is the reason for
discussing things.
