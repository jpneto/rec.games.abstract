Well, it's nice to see the silly thread about what is or isn't
a generalization of something else, is over.

But it leaves an interesting question which hasnt been decided.

Is it possible to construct a MindNinja-type game pattern,
i.e. a fixed pattern to be decided in advance of playing,
that both players must try to achieve, to be played on
some Hex or Quad board, that STILL has the property
of win/loss complementarity?   (As I call it, YMMV)
That is - that if one player makes this pattern,
it necessarily excludes the other making it, and that one
or other is certain to be made once the board is filled up.

So; a one-piece-put-per-move game, on a predetermined
board, with a predetermined pattern to make, which is
the same for both players, (i.e. both colours).

Equi-tasking and win-loss complementary.
The sort of game we purists love best!
_ _ _

Now OC, there are already games like this, namely "Y"
and its variants.  So I am specifically asking for a game
whose pattern-to-be-achieved is purely LOCAL, as in
5-in-a-row; rather than GLOBAL, as in connection games.

Anyone got any good ideas?  Even if they don't work out
straight off, someone else might see a good way to modify them.

And remember, being able to play with the size of the board,
to suit your style of pattern, is a big plus for the composer!

Anyone?
