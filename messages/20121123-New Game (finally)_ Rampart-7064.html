RAMPART
-------

Intro: Rampart is a unique game of annihilation in which players grow a set number of groups. It should be noted that Rampart is technically two games as there is a slight rule adjustment for games played on larger boards

Set-up: There are two official set-ups for Rampart (see PDF below)

Objective: The objective of Rampart is to annihilate all enemy groups.

Gameplay: Play Starts with black. On his turn a player may either add a stone of his color to the board or remove a dead enemy group. A group is any number of contiguous stones of a single color. A stone may only be placed such that it expands one or more of a player's groups. A group is considered dead when any stone within it meets the following 2 criteria.

a)The stone has no orthogonally adjacent empty points
b)The stone has at least one enemy stone orthogonally adjacent

except if the game is played on boards larger than 11x11 in which case only the first criterion applies. Removal of a dead group consumes a whole turn.. Removing own dead groups is strictly forbidden. If a player has no legal move on his turn he must pass. Passing is otherwise not permitted.

Man, it seems like forever since I released Slither and yet the accolades are still coming in. However you can't imagine how unworthy I feel about all this acclaim. It really has been forever (2+ years) since Slither, Ki or even Canvas (although I'd much rather we not discuss that one). I was frantically working away for quite a few months just trying to create another game that could live up to Slither's reputation. In fact Slither ended up being sort of poisonous to my mental well-being in that it had certainly brought me a lot of fulfillment both in its creation and subsequent reception but that achievement was also draining the life out of me as I now felt I needed to be designing games of a certain caliber. I will admit before I became the first official convert to Steere's Church of Cyclophobia (as Christian would have it) designing a new game was easy as hell but after Slither and my infatuation with Hex Oust I began to truly appreciate game design centered around essential design problems such as heightening depth, using negative feedback mechanisms to balance game play and other such concepts.

I wouldn't say these unproductive two years have been totally fruitless as I have slowly but surely been refining my senses to sniff out new game mechanics and inventive ways to effect game-play. If I had been really dedicated I probably could've condensed this period to 1 year but oh well. I feel Rampart is a culmination of this process as it marks a distinctive change in my approach. While I would agree that Slither was a stroke of genius, I would say even following its design and well after the fact that I didn't have a great sense of how to design a game. Slither was certainly brilliant from a spacial reasoning perspective but I still didn't fully have an appreciation for how to create incentives and disincentives for certain kinds of play. Even now I would say my understanding of game design could most definitely benefit from further experimentation. Rampart marks a real refinement in my understanding of coldness, tempo and parity. It utilizes some very unusual mechanics which imbue the game with drama and a lot of potential for reversal of fortune. I personally believe Rampart in its own ways is every bit as good as Slither although if it will be anywhere near as popular remains to be seen.

I have some other designs I may release now that Rampart has finally broken the dam. I haven't been entirely static in this period and I have both fully functioning games and many more ideas I might flesh out in the near future. As for fully functioning games. I have a couple of combinatorial games which may be of interest, one of which I actually have the rules typed up for. I also have an abomination of some notoriety called Radiolarians which one iggc player cannot get enough of for whatever reason. Anyway its great to be back guys!
