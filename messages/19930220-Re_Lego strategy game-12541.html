Preface: I normally avoid flame wars, but some idiot just turned off a
machine that was 90% done with a 4-hour number crunching job of mine and
I'm in a bad mood.  This bad mood wasn't helped by the assinine post I
am responding to, and I was irked by the "followup to /dev/null" trick
which I assume was supposed to forcibly assert his opinions.

Uh, Karl, exactly what were we supposed to get out of your post?  The mere
juxtaposition of two lines from a previous post isn't really very useful.
We aren't psychic; are we supposed to know what you're thinking, just by
your completely uninformative "hmmm..." ???

And - "reb" - Some people don't get <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>what<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ??  What is your point?

So let me see if I get your point: you don't understand what they are
trying to say.  Well, I could help you if I believed you and tell you
that the two were implying that there is a hypocracy revealed or at
least a seeming conflict of the interests expressed by the two lines
highlighted.  You may not agree with that, but you did understand it.

There is nothing inconsistent with the Daniel LaLiberte's desire to embark

Oops.  The cat is out of the bag now.  You <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> notice that they were

 Perhaps one of you
could enlighten us all as to exactly what you're trying to say here, because,
to be perfectly honest, I find this sort of coy innuendo to be offensive and
not at all informative.

Sorry, that didn't even work the first time, and now that you just
demonstrated that you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> understand the implication of conflict of

[details about what the LPF is deleted]
This (deleted) part is the most reasonable part of your statement.  You
would have been better served by answering the innuendo rather than
pretending not to understand it.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Now, either speak your minds clearly and unambiguously, or shut the f**k up!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What exactly do you mean by "your minds"?

1) Do you assume I have more than one mind and want me to speak them all?
2) Do you mean all the minds of people who read your post?
3) Do you mean all the minds of people who made inneundoes?
4) Do you mean all minds in the world?

Your statement is ambiguous.  In fact, you would find (if you took the
care and had the talent to do so) that all speech is ambiguous to a
greater or lesser extent, and it is impossible to communicate
unilaterally.  Any uncooperative listener can deny understanding, but to
do so is a rather pathetic substitute for argumentation.

Don't bother to respond with details about how RIGHT you are about what
the LPF is of why there is no conflict, and the part where you are WRONG
lies in your ridiculous demands for perfect clarity.  I do not contest
any of your points regarding the LPF or whether there is or isn't a
conflict and am more interested in sublimating a little anger and
attacking your poor method than in bickering over the subject of the LPF.
