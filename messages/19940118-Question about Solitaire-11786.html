I would like to use Solitaire as an example testbed for some
of the research I am doing.
Therefore, I am interested in answers or pointers to answers
to the folloing questions.

BTW, with the name Solitaire I refer to the 1-person game played on the
following board, where each move is a horizontal or vertical
jump as in checkers, and the goal is to leave one peg in the center
of the board.

1. How many (distinct) solutions are there to Solitaire?

2. How are solutions normally found: search, by hand?
   I know one solution which I read in a book a long time ago.

3. Does anybody know about programs which play solitaire.
   Which algorithms are used in these programs.

4. Are there articles published using Solitaire as testbed, or
   possibly even as main topic.

Any other information on the subject is welcome.

Thanks in advance,

Victor Allis
