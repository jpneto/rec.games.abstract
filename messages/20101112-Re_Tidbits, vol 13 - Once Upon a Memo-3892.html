Allow me a quote:
"A good game should also have drama: it should be possible for a
player to recover from a weaker position and still win the game.
Victory should not be achievable in a single successful blow; the
suspense should continue through an extended campaign. Otherwise an
early disadvantage makes the remainder of the game uninteresting: the
doomed player rightly guesses that the puzzle he is trying to solve
has no solution and that thinking about it is futile. A game's drama
might be measured roughly by matching a strong player against a weak
player, and having them switch sides after the strong player achieves
an advantage. In a dramatic game the strong player will still have a
chance of winning. But the difficulty of defining "advantage" clearly
will make drama harder to measure than depth."

let me jump the gun and write Mark Steere's post for him based on what
it will roughly look like

So much for that misplaced anal bead RGC, rofl. Way to go Clark,
dumbass.

Christian the quote you posted is interesting. One might find it
surprising that I agree with it since I have notoriously said that I
don't care if my games are fun to play. Two of my best designs are
made all the richer for their immense level of drama.

Oust is one of my most dramatic games. There's a definite sensation of
walking a plank  as you play Oust. Nothing is quite as painful as
losing a game of Oust

Oust:

another representative MSG that has no lack of drama is Flume.
