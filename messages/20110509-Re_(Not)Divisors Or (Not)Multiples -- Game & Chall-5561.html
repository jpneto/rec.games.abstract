First, the game.

This game is for any plural number of players.

Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper. (I suggest an n of at least
4 or 5 if there are two players who are beginners. I suggest a larger
n if there are more players.)

The game starts with Player 1 placing any integer &gt;=2 in any square of
the grid.
Thereafter, the players take turns. On a turn a player places any
integer &gt;= 2 in any empty square that is adjacent to and above, below,
left of, or right of any square with an integer in it already.

Each number must not have been used in the game yet.

And each number written down must be a divisor or a multiple of each
preexisting number that is orthogonally (above, below, left of, right
of) adjacent to it.

And each number written down must NOT be a divisor or a multiple of
(may be coprime or not coprime to) each preexisting number that is
diagonally adjacent to it.

The last player able to move wins.

Example finished game:
(n = 4. ** denotes an empty square. Leading 0's here are for
formatting.)

** ** ** 15
** ** 10 05
08 04 02 **
** ** 06 03

--------------------------

And now the challenge.

Start with a n-by-n grid.

Try to fill the grid with unique positive integers such that each
orthogonally adjacent pair is a multiple/divisor of each other, and
such that each diagonally adjacent pair is neither a multiple nor a
divisor of each other.

The challenge is to try to minimize the sum or the product of the
terms in the grid.

For example, here are some grids for n=1,2,3.

1

02 18
12 03

002 036 004
048 003 240
008 360 005

I am not claiming these grids (except the first) are optimal.

Can someone compute the optimal grids for the first few n's, if you
want?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

Here's an improvement (no claim to optimal) for n=3 (assuming I
understand the rules...)

002  030  005
024  003  105
004  084  007
