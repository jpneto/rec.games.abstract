By the way, that game of yours, "Oust", that you mentioned was gaining
a renaissance on igc? Turns out it was just the new game effect.
Because by now, it's surpassed by "Toguz Kumalak". That's right, Oust
has been ousted by the Dung Ball Game :-D

In your rants (or enlightened essays by a world-famous game designer
if you prefer - and I think you do, no matter what you say) you praise
sites like pbmserv, because that's where the "true gamers" are. Isn't
it interesting that on these "true gamer"-sites, very few people play
your games? People seem to play play Mark Steere games on sites with
lots of traffic, and few other alternatives.

Keep up the marketing of your games to site designers! You're good at
that, I grant you. So presumably you can be more charming when there's
something you want out of someone. Maybe if you can get many enough
people to try, some will actually play your games more than once!
