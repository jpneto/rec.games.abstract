    Beg pardon, what accusation are you claiming is false?
If you're going to accuse someone of making false accusations,
you should identify the "accusation", and specifically address it.
Most of what you posted is irrelevant to what i said.

    How is that contrary to what i said? quote:
	``Resigning the match sounds like typical Tinsley sportsmanship.
	After all, in the previous match, he bent over backwards to give
	Chinook a chance, then played under conditions that were highly
	favorable to the machine --- which after all never suffers from
	fatigue.''
Which of these facts are you disputing?

    No it wasn't necessary; neither was it was necessary for you to accept
the title, nor brag about it on r.g.c.

And, in another post:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

itimately won the title, we would have immediately resigned it [...]
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
    Is this not an admission that the title has not been legitimately won?
Is it not poor sportsmanship to accept a title not legitimately won?
