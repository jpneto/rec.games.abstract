First of all, there's an alternative:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/recregamescombinatorial?hl=en">http://groups.google.com/group/recregamescombinatorial?hl=en</a>

It's a closed group with the ambition to "to discuss abstract games in
a productive and encouraging environment".

Mark's not allowed in there

False, Mark doesn't want to be on there.

Bill Taylor doesn't like Mark.
Bill Taylor doesn't like me.
Bill Taylor likes profanity.

On a personal note: I wouldn't express my opinions quite the way Mark
does, but I'm not bothered by it. Mark has an undeniable talent and
for me that goes a long way. Sometimes I wish he'd take a more
interesting subject than Bill Taylor, but I'm no moderator and this is
not a moderated forum. On the same note: I wish Bill would keep to
"discussing abstract games in a productive and encouraging
environment" - but he keeps showing up here.

yeah this is a group dedicated to "the struggle to discuss games in an
environment of spam and extreme insults".
