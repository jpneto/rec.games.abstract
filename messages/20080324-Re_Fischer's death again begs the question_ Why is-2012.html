<br>People have been acclimated to football, and it has its pacing down

<br>I think this would be a disaster. Sports like football, soccer
<br>in Europe, etc. have a large following of people who have
<br>never played the sport, and have no great interest in the
<br>sport. Teams have a place within the culture and a following
<br>that has little to do with the sport itself.
<br>
<br>Interest in Fischer was similar. It wasn't about chess. It was
<br>about an American beating a Russian at their own game.
<br>
<br>I think a far better model to study would be the treatment
<br>of Go in Asia.
