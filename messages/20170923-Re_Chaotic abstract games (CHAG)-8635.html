Yes! I designed a new kind of abstract games.
I called them chaotic abstract games (CHAG) without even defining them.
The chaos is not about the board type, nor about the pieces,....
The chaos is inherent to the game play.
Imagine that each and any move will lead to complete new situation where the player have to decide a move like if it is his first move. Otherwise the game is purely tactical. No one can build a strategy. The game duration is infinite. Each player score points and that`s it. Like a boxing fight but without Ko`s. 
I developed some ideas about such type of games.
For sure it exists even if I did not check it some particular game having such property. Then it will be considered as really new game. It will have some fatherhood.
My idea is to generate 1000`s games built on such chaos.
So I need to design some common pattern with few parameters.
It will be then easy for anyone to build his own game using his own ideas..
Everyone could be a game designer! 

I will come back to give more precise view about what I have in mind.
For now I had just put my concept using few words letting many questions unanswered.

To create a new situation for the opponent player I will introduce a possibility for a player to move (at least 1) an opponent stone in a way that such move could not be reversed by his opponent. 
Dropping at least 2 stones per turn. So a player must move one the 2 stones just dropped. This action must be mandatory not optional.
What I`m doing now it is just a draft. That does not mean that I will not change it.

The game until now is defined in his main architecture :
- Filling the board by dropping stones (at least 2 per turn) in first phase and emptying the board in second phase. So the process could be repeated indefinitely. Anyway we could introduce some variants by making the game finite for some people who are haunted by what is commonly accepted. I want game infinite for life between 2. The idea behind is the more you play the more you discover a new way to play. Because the main goal for playing is not to win as used to be. It is like making love. You could have sex every day and each day one (often?) or the 2 partners enjoy it. 

- Creating some chaos for your opponent by changing his "strategy". You must move one of his stone to make him rethink everything. And vice-versa. Anyone of the players will have that ability.

I need to define the way of dropping (or emptying the board) first and then the way of moving you own stones and the opponent stones.
It will take more time because I have to create 2 new and original ways of moving stones. So I fixed the actions for each player to 5 where the players chooses 3 (mandatory). Each player must perform 3 out of 5 possible actions.
3 actions out of 5 is manageable by a human being. 
I`m still thinking on how to do it.
