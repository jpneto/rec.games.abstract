<br><blockquote type=cite>This is a game for any plural number of players.
<br>
<br>Start with an array of n-by-n dots, where n is decided by the players
<br>amongst themselves. (There should be a higher n if there are more
<br>players.)
<br>
<br>Players take turns moving. The first player to move starts on any dot.
<br>
<br>Each player on each of his/her moves draws two lines:
<br>On a player's move, he/she first draws a straight vertical line from
<br>{the dot where the last player left off [with a horizontal line, if
<br>this is not the first move of the game]} to {any dot in the same
<br>column as the dot the last player left off at}, making sure not to
<br>draw the line to or through any dot that has been drawn to previously
<br>by a line in the game.
<br>
<br>Then the same player draws a straight horizontal line from where his/
<br>her vertical line ended to any dot in the same row, also making sure
<br>not to draw the line to or through any dot that has been drawn to
<br>previously by a line in the game.
<br>
<br>The lines may not cross or coincide with another line. (This is
<br>obvious, since only "virgin" {not drawn to or from} dots may be drawn
<br>TO; although a dot need not be a virgin to be drawn FROM.)
<br>
<br>
<br>If, and only if, a player cannot draw a line of the direction
<br>indicated by the rules, then he/she must draw a line (of the same
<br>direction that he/she was first unable to draw during his/her move)
<br>from any non-virgin dot to/through some of the virgin dots in the same
<br>row/column.
<br>
<br>Scoring is as follows:
<br>
<br>Before a player draws a line (vertical or horizontal), enumerate the
<br>number of non-virgin dots in the same column (if before drawing a
<br>vertical line) or same row (if before drawing a horizontal line). The
<br>player gets this number of dots added to his/her score.
<br>
<br>Play continues until each dot is connected to by at least one line-
<br>segment. (ie. until each dot is not a virgin.)
<br>
<br>Highest score wins.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Leroy Quet
<br>
<br>PS: Does anyone still read Usenet anymore, by the way? Or has the
<br>amount of spam there lately and the fact that many big internet
<br>providers are no longer providing access to it severely cut down on
<br>its readership?
<br>
<br></blockquote>Leroy, there is nobody here but us spamaholics.
<br>
<br>I've gone over to outlook express since complaints to google do not work.
<br>freenews.netfront.net is currently hosting usenet groups dont ask me how.
<br>
<br>dot connections remind me of a John Horton Conway game which was or was
<br>described near something he called cabbages.
