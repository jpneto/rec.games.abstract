And let's take a look at Chess960.  When they did a tournament for it,
did anyone pick it up?  Did FIDE have it as an official game?
Chess960 is building a following, but as far as I know, it isn't
integrated into the chess community.  Why would Chess960 pick up a
following if there wasn't something there that regular chess isn't
providing?

I happen to like Fischer Random Chess (I don't like to call it
"Chess960", because I think Bobby Fischer deserves credit for 
his invention) but it is not chess, and thus there is no need 
to "integrate it into the chess community."

If it becomes popular, it becomes popular, and if there is a 
demand for a FRC federation and a rating system, that will 
follow from it becoming popular.

I have an engineer buddy who I play FRC with, because he has
never studied any openings.  FRC puts us on an equal footing
from the start.  We use the method where we take turns placing
QBBNN in white's back row, then put KRR in the remaining three
squares with K in the middle.  This adds another level of 
strategy that the dice/coin methods lack.
