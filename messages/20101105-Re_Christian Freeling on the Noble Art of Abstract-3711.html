Ok guys, goodbye. I tried to get the focus on a game (any game but I
happened to be occupied with Symple). Apparantly few have even tried
to understand a new and interesting mechanism, focused as they are on
proving some point regarding Mark, of which they also claim that
anyone can see it. Why keep pointing it out then? It's a Pavlov
reaction and I don't discuss games with dogs.

lol Christian you shouldn't have expected to get a good conversation
in the eye of a huge maelstrom of trolling and spam. Mark ruined this
site for the rest of us and now we're ruining it for him, it's
practically a spaghetti western. There are better places to discuss
abstract games ;)
