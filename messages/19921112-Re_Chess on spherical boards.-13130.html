    A1.  The bishop could also have moved to H2 or G3 instead.  Or,
going `southwest', to C1, D2, or E3.  Note that the white-square bishop
has just turned into a black-sqare bisop.  That's the breaks.

  "squares" (actually closer to triangles) at the "pinched" ends meet three

    I must be missing something.  I think E1 is adjacent to D2, E2, F2;
D1, F1; and H1, A1, B1, and no others, which makes eight total, as it
should be.

    Any time you try to bend a chessboard into a funny shape some
properties are going to change, to talking about an `only way' without
first discussing the properties you want to preserve is a little silly.
The board I've shown has some desirable properties (uniformity,
diagonals are great circles) and some undesirable ones.  (Diagonals are
each half black and half white.)  Yours has some good points and some
weak points too. (Left `k' is adjacent to right `k' in two different
directions, for example.)
