Three of the Nomic World expatriates met in Seattle and, together with a
NW bystander, played a complete face-to-face game in one evening.  These
are a few notes on how it went.  Apologies if I've misattributed
anything--it was a fairly late evening....

Players:

Storm (me)
Evantine (Gordon)
Goethe (Karim)
Jay

We used a copy of the original rules which had been pasted onto index
cards, one rule per card, plus a large deck of blank cards.  I recommend
this method as it made keeping track of rules and amendments relatively
easy.  We also (significantly, as it turned out) had a lot of game
paraphernalia on hand, since we played in Evantine's apartment.

Very early in the game we decided to use black and white chess pawns to
indicate No and Yes votes.  This apparently inconsequential decision
became important when Jay proposed that, after each vote, each player
should pass a pawn to the player on his/her left!  At first this seemed
unworkable, as players with two white or two black pawns felt rather
foolish when voting, but a second rule that kept pawns secret (except for
the one revealed when voting) rescued the concept.

This rule change had several immediate consequences.  It locked the
immutable rules in place; mutable rules could be amended or repealed by
a vote of more than half the players, but immutables still required
unanimity, and generally one player would have two black pawns and no
way to vote Yes.  It also meant that a No vote might indicate dislike of
a proposal, or simply lack of a white pawn--making politics a little
more confusing.

It was realized quickly that we needed more than two pawns per player.
Goethe arranged for additional pawns to enter play, and introduced
the concept that one could vote more than once, at the cost of having 
to pass as many pawns as one had used to vote.  This created some
strange dynamics as Storm began to hoard all the white pawns, forcing
everyone else to vote No.  An unforseen flaw in the pawn addition rule
also tended to create an excess of black and a shortage of white pawns.
Attempts to remedy this were hampered by No votes....

Further complications were introduced in the form of chess knights which
could be used to double the impact of same-colored pawns, and dice and
Scrabble tiles which were introduced when a player failed to be able to
pass requisite numbers of pawns (and had, at first, no other
significance).  This provoked the game's only serious judicial crisis,
as we'd been sloppy about specifying the exact order in which events
happened, as well as the consequences if a rule required an impossible
action (such as passing a pawn which the player no longer had).  Storm
designed a meta-rule allowing easy addition to a strict order-of-play
roster, several quick Judgements were made, and the game continued.

At this point no one had very many points, and Evantine (through no
obvious fault of his own) had spent most of the game with a negative score.
However, the introduction of a new rule allowing rolling of differently
sized dice caused scores to skyrocket.  The last stages of the game were
dominated by struggles for dice ownership, and the game was decided by
Goethe's triumphant acquisition of a 30-sided die just in time to make
two rolls in a row.  He ended at 98 points, placed the Scrabble tile "o"
on the table and claimed it as his remaining two points (double the
Scrabble value).  After a quick dictionary check he was declared the
winner.

The other feature of the late play was a "sunset" rule that allowed each
player to nominate a mutable rule to be "suspended" (removed from play
temporarily) when the number of mutable rules exceeded the allowed 25.
A rule was then chosen from among the four nominees by chance.  This was
rather nervewracking as the consequences of suspending a crucial
procedural rule were difficult to understand (especially at 11:00 pm).
Experience with this sibling of the Nomic World "Triple Witching Hour"
suggests that clear rules for the effect of suspending a procedural rule
are needed before games with this feature will be stable.  As it was, at
several points players had what seemed to me to be opportunities to
claim a win on paradox, but declined to take them--they were having too
much fun, and it seemed somehow unsporting.

This game was odd in that it had no alliance structure (Goethe and
Storm, and Goethe and Evantine, were teammates throughout but this had
few practical consequences after an initial flurry of interest) and the
outcome was basically decided by dice.  Nonetheless, I found it
interesting and entertaining.  Most of the brainwork went into
allowing the game to continue (kill those black pawns!) rather than
attempting to win it.

The midgame took on a rather ritualistic feel, as we displayed our votes
and then ran through a complex series of pawn and knight exchanges, dice
rolls, pawn counts, die and tile additions, and scoring....
