Atoll, like Hex and Y, has the property that on a randomly filled
board exactly one player achieves his objective.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like to call this property   "Win/Loss complementarity."

It does not merely exclude ties, for example, but also excludes
games of a mere "racing" type, where both players may achieve their
goals and the winner is whoever does it first.   Less satisfying.

It's ultra-nice when a winning position to one player automatically
entails that none is subsequently possible to the other, even with
endless free moves.

It's even better when win-loss complementarity is combined with
"Equi-tasking", which is where both players have the identically same
task!

So e.g. Y has equi-tasking, but Hex does not, quite.
(It has isomorphic tasking though.  As does Atoll.)

Great board, Mark!   Brilliant idea!    Well done.
