I posted this in Leroy Quet's most recent thread, but then I decided
to give it's own entry to solicit some help.  I've been on a two year
quest to design a perfect information (or as near as possible to
perfect information) word game that doesn't stink.  This has turned
out to be a phenomenally difficult task, much harder for me that the
geometric/mathy abstracts that I'm used to designing.  I've had plenty
of really nice concepts, but none of them survive formal playtesting.
So it is with this one.  Nonetheless, I personally like this game
alot, and I'm still holding out hope that I can find some way to
correct the problem that's came up in playtesting.

The main problem is that it induces debilitating analysis paralysis in
my playtesters.  Way too much.  How can I reduce analysis paralysis,
without removing what I regard to be the defining element of the game,
which is that your score depends on how many letters your word shares
with your opponent's most recently played word (see rules below).

Anyway, I'm hoping that by raising the issue here, one of you guys
will have something in your bag of tricks that will simplify the
game.  Here are the current rules:


1.  It's played on two side-by-side grids, each 9 cells wide (although
it can be played on different grids, 9-cells wide seemed ideal.)

2.  You own one grid, and your opponent owns the other.

3.  Players take turns.  On each turn you write down a word in the
upmost available horizontal row on your grid.  Your score for turn is
the number of letters that your word shares with your opponent's most
recently played word, times the number of letters in the longest word
that you formed <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>vertically<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> when you added the new word
horizontally.  For example, if you wrote "tan" on your first turn, and
then on your second turn, you wrote "cat" such that the "t" from cat
is directly below the "a" from "tan", then you would have formed the
word "at" vertically.  Since "at" is 2 letters long, your score for
that turn is 2 times however many letters "cat" shares with your
opponent's most recently played word.

4.  the first letter of your word may be in any cell, as long as the
word fits completely in your grid.

5.  No word may be played twice, and you may not play a word that
contains in its entirety a word previously played by any player.

6.  There's a bonus if your word is an anagram of your opponent's most
recently played word.

7.  Game ends after say, 8 turns.  Highest score wins.

8.  If you think your opponent played a fake word, you can challenge
it, and if it is a fake word, you're opponent gets zero points for his
turn.  If your challenge fails, you must skip your next turn.  Fake
words <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> removed from the board after they've been played.

9.  Since the score is undefined for the each player's first turn, the
first turn of the game works differently:

-To begin, a word is picked randomly from the dictionary, and then
player 1 writes that word into his topmost gridline.  He also adds any
number of points he wants to either player's score column.  Then
player 2 decides whether to play as player 1 or player 2.  This acts
as a pie rule, and the randomly chosen initial word ensures that each
game will proceed very differently.
-The score for player 2's first turn is the just the number of letters
that his first word shares with the randomly chosen word that player 1
wrote down on his first turn.

Now, somebody will suggest that I try simplifying the score, such that
your score is just the number of letters that your word shares with
your opponent's most recently played word.  I tried it, and it doesn't
word.  The game because much more stagnant.  It needs some kind of
multiplier or modifier, but I think the particular multiplier featured
here is not right; it's a big source of analysis paralysis.
