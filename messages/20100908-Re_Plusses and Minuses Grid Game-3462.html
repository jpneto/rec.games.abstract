This game is for two players.

Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper. I suggest that n be &gt;= 8.

The first part of the game doesn't involve the grid. In this part of
the game, the players take turns each contributing to their own
"prediction list" of +'s and -'a. On each move, a player appends to
the end of their list either a + or a -. Each player is aware of the
other player's list as it is being made. After both players' lists are
n-1 symbols long, this part of the game is over. (See below for the
significance of the lists.)

I suggest at this point that a dot be put at the lower left corner of
the grid so as to keep this corner straight from the others.

In the next part of the game, the players take turns, each move
filling in an empty square of the grid. The filled in square must not
be in the same row or column as any other filled in square.

After n squares total have been filled in, this part of the game is
over.
(There will be exactly one filled in square in each row and in each
column.)

Now, we determine the scores.
Take the grid, with the dot in the lower left corner.
Going from the left to the right, the filled in squares represent a
permutation P = (p(1),p(2),...p(n)) of (1,2,3,...,n). Player 1 forms a
"truth list" of +'s and -'s, where the kth symbol is the sign of p(k
+1)-p(k).

Going from bottom to the top, the filled in squares represent a
permutation Q = (q(1),q(2),...q(n)) of (1,2,3,...,n), where Q is the
inverse permutation of P. Player 2 forms a truth list of +'s and -'s,
where the kth symbol is the sign of q(k+1)-q(k).

Write each players truth list below their prediction list so that
respective signs are lined up. Each player gets a point for each
corresponding pair of signs that match.

Largest score wins.

Here is a sample game:

n = 8.

Grid:
. * . . . . . .
. . . . . . . *
. . . . . . * .
. . . . . * . .
. . * . . . . .
. . . . * . . .
. . . * . . . .
* . . . . . . .

Player 1's prediction list: + - + - + - +
Player 1's truth list:      + - - + + + +
The first pair, second pair, 5th pair, and 7th pair match. So, player
1 gets 4 points.

Player 2's prediction list: + + - + + - +
Player 2's truth list:      + + - + + + -
The first pair, second pair, 3rd pair, 4th pair, and 5th pair match.
So, player 2 gets 5 points.

Player 2 wins.

I actually played this game with someone else recently, and it is kind
of fun.

Some suggestions:

I suggest that n be odd {so that if the second player moving in the
second part of the game is just copying the first player's moves (by
filling (j,k) whenever the first player fills (k,j)), then the first
player can fill a square in the main diagonal to throw the second
player off}.

Also, maybe the first player to move in the first part of the game
should move second in the second part of the game. Just to be fair.

I suggest that (for beginners) before playing the second part of the
game, a vertical arrow and a horizontal arrow should be drawn nect to
the grid, each arrow pointing away from the lower left corner. Then
the arrows should be initialed with the player whose direction
corresponds to each arrow. For instance, the player who is concerned
with the permutation P would label the horizontal arrow with their
initial. But the player concerned with the ascents and descents of
permutation Q would label the vertical arrow.
This is just to make things clear for beginning players.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
