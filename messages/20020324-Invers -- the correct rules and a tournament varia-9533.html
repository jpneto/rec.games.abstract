Invers was invented by Kris Burm who is a wonderful person. No, not
because he invented wonderful games (such as Dvonn, Gipf, and Invers),
but because that's the way he is. I met him at the famous toy fair in
Nuremberg and we also exchanged many interesting e-mails in which we
discussed his games.

You can find the wrong rules at Joao Neto's homepage:

The correct(ed) rules are:

I. Each player may slide out and invert his own soldiers to Kings.
II. If he is unable to do that, he slides out and inverts enemy soldiers.
III. If he is unable to do I. or II. he slides out his own kings, however,
     without inverting them later.

Three times the same move by both players is a draw. (according to
personal correspondence with Kris Burm)


The rule:

"If no further moves are possible and neither player has all his tiles
 inverted, then the player with the most inverted tiles is the winner."

-- is given in the set, but IT IS NONSENSE. Such a situation is
mathematically impossible on a 6x6 board as every highschooler (at least
in Germany) from  grade 7 upwards can prove. The rule, btw, was NOT made
by Kris Burm, but by the publisher, probably Wofgang Perner, who should
be ashamed (yet another proof that capitalism is spoiling abstract games).


Kris approved the following improved variant I suggested for tournament
play:

Invers is played on a 6x8 board. Each player has 25 piecies.
If a player cannot make a move, he must pass. Otherwise he must move.
A game is decided as soon as the pieces of one player has all been turned
upside down. Then the winner gets as many points as his opponent has still
pieces which are not turned upside down. In the rare case of a drawn game
(repetition of moves) the game has to be replayed with colors reversed in
tournament play (a rule borrowed from Gipf and Go).
