I'm searching information about an abstract board-game
I remember playing in my early teens (in the beginning
of 1980's that is). It was sold with the name "Taistelu"
(= a battle) in Finland, probably by Alga (but could
be Peliko as well), and it was a chess-like, almost
deterministic battle board game, a bit like Chess,
except that the pieces were various officers from
the 1700 or 1800-century army (looked quite Napoleonic
to me...), plus also "a spy" and "a cannon", all 
illustrated on the upright cardboard pieces of the
same shape, which were set in the beginning of the
game to one's own beginning ranks of the board in
any order of one's liking, so that the back side was towards
the opponent (so that the initial situation
of the opponent stayed secret to both players),
and then players started moving their pieces (in pawn
like fashion I recollect, still the back toward the
opponent), and not until two enemy pieces stood next
to each other did they reveal their values,
with the higher officer usually winning, but with
some nice non-transitive quirks in the hierarchy,
like that a cannon killed everybody, and so on.
(Maybe it also depended which one of the opposing
pieces had moved first to that position).

Does anybody have more information about this 
or similar games with hidden pieces?


Yours,

Antti Karttunen
