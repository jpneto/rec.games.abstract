I agree. I'd say that a race element is not a bad thing provided that there are enough blocking options, and there are plenty of them, both in Gonnect and Orcoon, thanks to the limited connectivity of the square board.

Havannah is essentially a race game too so the hexboard does nicely :)

Yes, I'm sure it does. Of course, there are less blocking options on a hex board, but I guess ring threats play a similar role in Havannah. Since you have to lose time answering them, they slow your connection down just like a blocker would. I have almost no playing experience with Havannah, though, so I'm just not sure about their real incidence. In any case, I suspect they're the most interesting aspect of the game :)

On another note, it says here that two messages 'have been removed'. That's a novelty at rga (as far as I know). Anyone knows by whom and why?

That was me, sorry. :) I re-posted a message because of typos, but I hadn't removed the original one yet and the re-posted one was marked as a quote of the former, so I removed both. I didn't expect the removal to be reported, though. That's new indeed.
