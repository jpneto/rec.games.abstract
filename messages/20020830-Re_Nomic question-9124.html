Here's 2 situations of a Nomic game. It seems that these loopholes

just that a certain level of honour is expected when playing).

It's not so much honour, as an agreement to actually abide by the
rules. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, but "abiding by the rules" is subjective, paritcularly in Nomic
games where players make up their own rules. My situations were a
little extreme, but the point of my question was to find out how (if)
this problem is dealt with by Nomic players. It can get much more
serious (as you pointed out in your story). Players can deliberately
make rules that might not seem ambiguous at the time of voting, but
maybe forsee a conflict with a rule (that purposely turns out in their
favour) at some time in the future.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Both the examples you cite contain deliberate gross
misinterpretation of the rules. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course they do, but because of rule 212 they are still valid
situations, and allow for other situations like it. Take a game like
chess. It has a closed set of very strictly defined rules, so the
possibility of misinterpretation is almost as large winning the
lottery. Moving a pawn 7 spaces is just too obviously an invalid move.

In Nomic, that's not the case: the rule set is an open, unbounded set
of possibly ambiguous rules. It seems there must be a level of honesty
that the players must play with to avoid constantly bickering over
ambiguities. Some playes might disagree on purpose, even though they
know the correct interpretation of a rule, to prevent its application.
If this person is convincing enough, or makes enough of a fuss to
annoy the other players he might just convince them otherwise (or they
might just agree to get on with the game).

I'm not one, but unfortunately there exists many dishonest players.
It's a fact of life: everyone uses cheat codes. In chess, you can't
really cheat because the rule set is too clear and there's no
information hiding. In this game, it might not be easy but it's
definitely a lot more feasible than in other games to completely bend
the interpretation of a rule to your favour. Worse results come when
people like this become the judge (as you had pointed out). Then, the
person next in sequence can take advantage of the judge's poor
rationality, and the games just turns inside-out.

ps. thanks for the Nomic resources. I'm looking forward to playing my
first game soon.. maybe online.
