	Subject says it all.  I am looking for rules to any three player
   game or variations on games to play with three players.  Also, any
   rules to use with dominoes.  I have a set with no rules and would
   like to learn some games with them.

   Thanks,
   Trevor

Well, a good book with a lot of Domino Games is _The World's Best Indoor
Games_ by Gyles Brandreth (Pantheon Books, 1981.  ISBN 0-394-71001-0).  I
got it for $4.98 at a used book store - the cover price is $9.95.

The following domino games are included:

Fours			French Draw		Fives and Threes
Ends			Draw or Pass		Forty-two
Blind Hughie		Bergen			Bingo
Round the Clock		Matador
Maltese Cross		Fives
Block			Threes
Partnership Block	Sniff
Tiddly-wink		Muggins
Sebastopol		Five Up
Cyprus			All Fives

The book also includes chapters on Parlour Games, Word Games, Paper and
Pencil Games, Card Games, Board Games, Dice Games, Matchstick Games, Games
of Chance, Allsorts (miscellaneous games), Solo Games, Children's Party
Games and Children's Card Games.  Each chapter has about as many games
as the domino games listed above.  I haven't looked at it much (only bought
it a couple days ago), but it has a nice variety of games - many of them
abstract.
