Adapting the rules for CalvinBall should make everyone happy...

That's it!  I AM going to come up with Calvinball chess rules (aka,
Calvin Chess) that theoretically makes it possible for someone to
never play chess twice with the exact same set of rules.  COOL!

Thanks for the links :-)

Anyhow, in a more general note, I think it would be interesting to see
how exactly a functioning version of Calvinball chess could work,
provided it kept with the needed framework of being a deterministic
abstract strategy game, with no luck and perfect information.  Imagine
Fischer's Random Chess, but it isn't just the board that is mixed up,
but also the game rules.  This would be the extreme end of the variant
community as far as things happen.
