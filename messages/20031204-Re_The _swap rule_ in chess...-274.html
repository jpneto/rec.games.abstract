Funny, coz to me it seems like you just explained how they are the same.

The novelty is a standard part of an opening that the other person is 
not familiar with. Hey, that was your definition of a trap.
And also, after it's worked once for a GM, it is the X-version of the Y 
opening, and shall be studied by all.

Not at all. "Novelty" means "new": it's something that the player has 
come up with an analyzed. It's usually a move that has not been played 
in the position before or a move that fell out of favor because people 
thought it was weak but for which a new continuation has been found. 
This may just give a positional edge, and there may be no special 
tactics involved.

OTOH, a trap is a fairly well-known tactical situation that you might 
fall for if you don't play the opening. For example, it looks like you 
can just take that pawn or make that move, but if you do there's a known 
tactical sequence that leads to an unfavorable position or a loss of 
material. An example is a pawn that looks underdefended but can be 
recovered by a pawn fork trick, resulting in a better position for the 
forker.
