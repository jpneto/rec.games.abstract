Very interesting game, Augustine.

	------------------------------------------------------------------

	The board has 25 squares, or spaces, arranged in a 5 x 5 grid,
	represented here as, 

                           S     S     S     S     S
     
                           S     .     .     .     S

                           .     .     .     .     .

                           O     .     .     .     O

                           O     O     O     O     O 

	                   Fig. 1  Starting Position
 
	--&gt; RULES:

	1. A piece can move only if it is next (incl. diagonally) to one
	of its own color.  When this is satisfied, you may move it any
	number of empty squares, in a straight line, and in any one direction.

	2. If you have a piece that is next to neither one of its own, 
	nor one of the other color, then you are in check, and can play to 
	clear the check only. If it can't be done, you must pass.

	3. The objective is to disperse your pieces so that each one
	ends up next to pieces of the other color only, not their own.

	------------------------------------------------------------------

May I suggest, however, some slight tidying up of the wording. The use of the
"check" concept is unnecessary, and may be confusing.  It could be thus...

	1. A piece that is (diagonally or orthogonally) adjacent to one
	   of its own color may move any number of empty squares in a straight 
           line in one direction.

	2. If at the start of your turn you have a piece that is adjacent to no
           pieces of either color, then any play must leave a situation where
           you have no such piece. If this can't be done, you must pass.

	3. The winner is the first player who gets all his pieces adjacent to
           at least one of the opponent's and none of his own.


However, neither these nor the original rules are complete, in that these
situations are not made clear....

(a) if a player has a legal move, is it compulsory to move, or may they pass?

(b) if a situation is achieved where BOTH players have a winning position as
    in rule 3, who is the winner, or is it a draw, or does play continue?

(c) if a situation is achieved where both players get an isolated piece as in
    rule 2, then neither may legally move again!  Is this to be a draw?

If you have not decided on these matters yet; may I earnestly suggest that
(b) is made so that the player who just moved is the winner; and that (c) is
forbidden by making it illegal to form bi-isolated positions.  As to (a) I have
no special preference one way or the other.

It looks like a fun game!  I like the "isolated piece" rule.  Can't wait to
try an email game with someone, once these ambiguities are cleared up.
