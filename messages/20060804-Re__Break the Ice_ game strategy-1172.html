<br>&nbsp; I wouldn't; but then I don't know what heuristics or data formats

<br>By " 9! " I think you're referring to the permutations of

<br>But the opening A-B-C leads to the same position as C-B-A
<br>(they <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>transpose<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> into each other: that's why we speak of

<br>considered.&nbsp; Stated differently, the number of positions reached
<br>in your example is 2^9 not 9!, right?&nbsp; Do I misunderstand?
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; Ah, yes. I misunderstood what you were saying. You're correct; storing
<br>a table of positions <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> cheaper than storing a table of game trees,
<br>because of all the repeated positions.
