Hello,

i found the following information:



" In fact, there's a version of backgammon, which is much more popular
   than regular bg in USSR, especially in Azerbajdzhan and Uzbekistan.
   Main features are following:
     * both players go same direction ( namely counterclockwise )
     * starting position is different
     * you're not allowed to hit ( which changes strategy a lot).
   And, as far as I know, there are tournaments, where people play this
   version without dices, i.e. calling their rolls. Consequently, there
   exist time control in this tournaments. "


***** Does anybody know the full rules of "diceless backgammon", e.g.
      starting position and how are rolls called?

      What is the Russian name of the game?



Gamely Yours,

Ralf
