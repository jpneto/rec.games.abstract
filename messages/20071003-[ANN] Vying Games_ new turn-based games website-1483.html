Hi, Vying Games (vying.org) is a new turn-based game site I've been working 
on for a few months now.  Right now we have the following games:

  *  Connect6
  *  Pente
  *  Keryo-Pente
  *  Phutball (Philosopher's Football)
  *  Breakthrough
  *  Othello
  *  Kalah
  *  Oware
  *  Footsteps

As you can see, abstract board games make up the majority of our games.  I
hope to expand in the future to include card games and other turn-based
games.  I'm particularly interested in striking a balance between popular,
well-known games, and less well-known games that deserve more attention.
Though, I have to admit I'm a little more partial to games that have under
served player communities.

The site itself is (as of now, and for the foreseeable future) free and
advertising free.  I'm trying for a look and feel that's understated and
simple, as opposed to sites that look like they're catering to children.

Anyway, I'd love to play some r.g.a lurkers, or get some feedback, or game
suggestions, etc.  

I play as "eki" if anyone would like to get a game going.  : ))

Thanks,
Eric
