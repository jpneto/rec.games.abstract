====================
CHAR is played on a 4x4x4 grid. Each player has three kinds of pieces. I
forget what they call them but one piece is a solid circular disk (disk), 
one is a disk with a hole (donut) and one is a piece that fits in the 
hole (hole). The last two are half pieces. Two complmentary half pieces 
may be placed on the same space regardless of whether they belong to the 
same player or not. Pieces are played in a strict sequence, something like:
disk, donut, hole, disk, donut, hole etc. I think the object is simply to 
get four of your pieces in a row, but it there may be more to it than that.

The board itself is clear plastic and about 18 inches tall. I think it's 
closer to 50 bucks than 30.

One odd thing that has nothing to do with game play. There is a long 
detailed history of the game on the back of the box and continued on the 
pamphlet on the inside describing the game's origins and how it was used in 
religious ceremonies. The story is 100% bogus. Personally, I would think 
that it violates the truth in advertising laws (at least in the US) since 
the entire back of the box is a big lie aimed at convincing the public to 
buy the game based on its long and venerable history. It's funny to me; 
typically a game company will ripoff an old game and pretend they invented 
it (e.g. Othello = Reversi, Pente = Ninuki Renju), but with Char, someone 
finally invents a brand spanking new game, and they claim that it's 2000 
years old! (I wonder how that would affect copyrite infringement; if I 
produce a copy of the game that THEY claim is 2000 years old, what can 
they say execpt "We lied.")
==============
TEEKO is a game invented by John Scarne and it may be the only game he 
invented that he didn't name after himself! I doubt very much you could
buy a set now; the game was invented decades ago. It's played on a 5 x 5
grid. Each player has 4 pawns. In the simplest version (there are several), 
players take turns placing pieces until all eight are on the board. Then they
take turns moving one of their pieces as a chess king moves. The goal is to 
get 4 in a row, or 4 in a small square. (Some versions allow four in a 
square to include the four corners of a square of any size.) He wrote a book
called <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Scarne on Teeko<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> which is fairly easy to find in a major library.
Some of his other books, such as <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Scarne on Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> may also include more 
detailed rules.
===============
TERRACE rules have been posted in rec.games.abstract more than once recently,
so I assume someone else will send/post them to/for you. 
===============
PYROS is a game played in 3-D by stacking balls. I think the object is to be
the one to place the top ball finishing the pyramid, and forming certain 
configurations allow you to remove balls from the structure. I don't know
the rules.
