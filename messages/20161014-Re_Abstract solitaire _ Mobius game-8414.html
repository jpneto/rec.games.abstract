Admittedly I don't understand it but thats what makes it a piece of shit I guess. Nobody is going to understand it, there is no audience for this trash or any of your other contrivances. Keep this junk to yourself fuckboy.

I published my game in forum dedicated to mathematics.
I received until now the answers about the strategy to build to empty the urn.
Guys are skilled in maths so they did not even ask for explanations or whatsoever even if I omit some words while typing (because I used to type directly on the thread almost any of my game).
Those guys are smart enough to understand the more important.
They are not like Corey the deeply dumb whose only goal is bashing anything coming from the best game designer Hazen.

Your legacy? Botched Copy-pasted games just good to be thrown at the garbage.
A guy like Taylor has plagiarize Stonehenge (a crappy game) a Knizia game who is himself a crappy game designer.
I quote the main mechanic of Stonehenge :
"When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. 
So what? You could create 100000000 of games based on this dumb idea (not one).
Territory game = controlling more area = majority on line, on square, on circle, on any part of the board..... That lead to 100000000000 games possible. A program well designed could generate 10000 each minute.
