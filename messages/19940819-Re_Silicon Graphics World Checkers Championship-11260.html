well, apparently the chinook software can beat every human except Tinsley,
and it is unclear if there will ever again be a (human) draughts player of
Tinsley's calibre.  i think this is a pretty unique situation.  in
athletics and in chess, it is a given that when the best start to wane,
new, young competitors, the best of the next generation takeover.

if software doesn't get good enough to defeat Tinsley during Tinsley's
lifetime, we'll never know whether some future, better software would
have defeated Tinsley. in fact, it seems to be unclear whether a
machine could do better than draw a match with Tinsley through any
means other than sheer stamina. from a scientific point of view, this might
be as interesting as showing that a slow, electric golf cart that runs 10mph,
and can can go for 25hrs on a battery charge can defeat a human runner in a
250 mile race.
