I have a little doubt about the rule allowing only one bridge to be
placed when a move to a square permits more than one.  Might this lead
to situations where a critical bridge can never be built, possibly
even leading to draws?

And I don't especially like the name Bloctagons, partly because there
is an existing, closely related game by Wayne Schmittberger called
Octagons.  But also becuase it has an ugly ring to my ear.  But that's
highly subjective.

Otherwise, as a fan of connection games, I think you have something
interesting here.
