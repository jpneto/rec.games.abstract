Squer of Luigi :
"After a placement by Black, all lines of horizontally adjacent white pieces that are horizontally adjacent to the placement are flipped."

Shello of Bentley
"3. After placing or moving a piece, flip all enemy pieces lying in an uninterrupted straight orthogonal or diagonal row between the piece you placed or moved and any friendly pieces. (just like in Othello)"

Luigi87 is a "patchworker" not a game designer.
Picking mechanics here and there and using them in a game is NOT designing.
YOU HAVE TO CREATE NEW CONCEPT FIRST AND ONLY THEN YOU COULD BORROW SOME MECHANICS.
There is no new concept in Squer.
HAO my variant of hex is based on new concept and more than that introducing new mechanics.
