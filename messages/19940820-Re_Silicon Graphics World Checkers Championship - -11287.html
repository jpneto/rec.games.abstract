   What a swell victory.  Chinook is "world champion" without winning a
single game.  USUALLY a challenger has to have a + score to claim the title.
   Resigning the match sounds like typical Tinsley sportsmanship.  After
all, in the previous match, he bent over backwards to give Chinook a chance,
then played under conditions that were highly favorable to the machine ---
which after all never suffers from fatigue.
   Too bad the Chinook team doesn't have such sportsmanship.  IMO the match
should have been declared a draw with the champion retaining his title until
his health improved enough for a rematch.  Tinsley gave you guys every
possible break, and IMO you're just taking advantage of his overdeveloped
sense of fair play.  Guess that's just another area where machines are
superior, they don't suffer from that human weakness.

This has to be one of the most thoughtless postings I have seen in a long time.
Do you think we are happy with the situation?  We came here to play Tinsley.
I have worked for 5 years for this opportunity and am <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> disappointed
at what has happened.  We take no satisfaction in "winning" this title.

Before making false accusations, you should check the facts.
Let me clarify a few of your "points".

First, contrary to what you said, we have bent over backwards for Tinsley.
We have always been acutely aware of the pressure of man playing machine and
have done everything to make this as easy for him.  For example:
- At Tinsley's request, we reduced the number of games in the match from 40
  to 30 to prevent fatigue from being an issue
- Instead of the usual 20 moves an hour, we agreed to 24.
- Instead of 1 rest day (as is standard in human play) I offered him 3.
We wanted Tinsley to be at his best.  He was very happy with the match
arrangements.

Second, we have offered to postpone the match a day, a week, or several months.

Third, the suggestion to resign the match and the title comes from Tinsley
himself.  As I said, this is NOT the way we wanted things to happen.

Finally, I would also like to point out that the checker federations have 
recognized Chinook as world champion and sanctioned the match against Don
Lafferty.  Although unsatisfactory from our point of view, it allows the 
event to continue and something to be salvaged from an unfortunate
situation.

We hope that it will be possible to play Tinsley in the near future.  What 
happened is unfortunate.  Our actions have been one of concern for Tinsley,
a personal friend, and doing what is best for my team, our sponsors, the
match organizers and the venue.

I see no need to accuse us of being unsportsmanlike.
