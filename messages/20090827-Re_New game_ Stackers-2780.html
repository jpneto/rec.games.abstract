Again comparing your game to Chess.  Chess, as we all know, is not

Are you serious?  It's not a matter of statistics.  What about two

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is no equivalent of that in Stackers, as you don't win by
capturing opponent pieces, so you don't get this kind of stalemate.

The closest I can see is a situation where there are one piece of each
colour next to each other.  One jumps on top of the other to block it,
but in the next round, it has to move away, and the other can jump on
top of that to block it, reversing the situation.  This can potentially
go on forever, but dependong on which edge is closest, one of the
players can win by breaking the pattern and make for the edge.  Since
you cannot pass, you cannot block forever, and once you unblock, the
other can run away.

 Nobody has to force a draw.  One way a draw can be reached is when
both players agree that the game isn't leading anywhere conclusive.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed.  Chess avoids this by forcing a draw if no piece has been
captured in 50 moves (IIRC).  It is still a draw, though.  Draws can be
avoided by forbidding repetition of positions and declaring a player the
loser if he has no legal move under this restriction.  This is more or
less what Go does.

 That won't
happen in a naturally finite game, because every move brings the game
closer to a conclusion.  Your options are limited: win or lose.

Quite true.  But I can't see that you can't have a good game even when
draws (finite or infinite) are possible.

In the same fashion, another person with zero experience in the game

With all this talk of substance, where's your substance?  Why are you
so convinced that draws couldn't possibly become a major problem in
your game?  Maybe the great, great grandmothers were right in that
defensive play is really the best play in your game, *again, as far as
you know*.

I never said that draws couldn't possibly be a major problem, I just

Ok, Logic Man.  So you should probably be able to name one real,
playable game that has draws and doesn't have move order advantage.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You play two games of, say, Hex one after the other, switching who
starts.  If one player wins both games, he wins, otherwise it is a draw.

This is perfectly playable (and quite often how it is played in
practise) and there is no move-order advantage, as any move-order
advantage in Hex is eliminated by playing both first and second in the
two games.  A player can in the second game try to mirror the first
game, but at best he can force a draw this way, so this is not a
first-player or second-player advantage.

I wouldn't call a game prone to draws just because they can happen.
Prone implies that it is likely:

    * Main Entry: prone
    * Pronunciation: \ˈprōn\
    * Function: adjective
    * Etymology: Middle English, from Latin pronus bent forward,
      tending; akin to Latin pro forward — more at for
    * Date: 14th century
1 : having a tendency or inclination : being likely &lt;prone to
    forget names&gt; &lt;accident-prone&gt;
2 a : having the front or ventral surface downward b : lying
      flat or prostrate

Armies don't butt heads in Stackers, as two armies can't block each
other.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
you don't know if draws will
become a major problem.  As far as you know, with a little experience
under your belt, every game will be a draw.  Maybe the Mexican
standoff is perfect play for your game.  Games are released like that
all the time, like Batalo for instance, etc., etc., etc.  After a
little experience, every game is a draw.  Ok, stay with me here
Torben.  I didn't just say that draws are guaranteed to become a major
problem in your game, ok?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, but you more or less out of hand rejected it as a game because of
the possibility for draws.
