|&gt; Okay - people have been talking about chess varients, so here are the
|&gt; ones I know about and play frequently:
|&gt; 

[games deleted]

There is in fact an entire field called "fairy chess" which makes up
and plays new variants of chess, often for problem compositions.
One book which catalogues many of these variants is:

@book{dickins,
author = "Anthony Dickins",
title = "{A} {G}uide {t}o {F}airy {C}hess",
publisher = "Dover",
year = "1971"}

There are too many variants discussed in this book to list them all,
so I'll just list a few I played and liked.  Many of these features
can be used in combination to create a wide variety:

1. Imitator chess.  Place a new piece, called an imitator (a coin does
the job nicely), on the square d4, otherwise the setup is the same as
normal chess.   No players take turns making normal chess moves, but
each time they move a piece from &lt;X1,Y1&gt; to &lt;X2,Y2&gt;, they also move
the imitator from &lt;XI,YI&gt; to &lt;XI+X2-X1,YI+Y2-Y1&gt;.  For example, if 
the imitator is on d4 and I move Ng1-f3, I then must move imitator
to c6.   If making this move would put the imitator on an occupied
square (after moving your own piece) or off the board, that move is
illegal.  

2. Neutral men.  Start the game with some with some men declared to be
neutral.  On his turn a player can move one of his own men, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>or<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a
neutral man which has not just been moved. 

3. Rifle chess.  In normal chess, pieces capture by moving to a final
square.  Change this so that the piece does the capture, but then gets
put back on its original square.  This makes it impossible to directly
defend pieces.

4. Robot chess (from Danny Loeb):  On a turn you either make a normal
move, or you can "program" a pawn by specifying a direction for it to
travel (often by turning it on its side and pointing it that way).  
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Before<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> each player makes his move, all his own robot pawns make
their moves.  A robot pawn moves 1 square in its specified direction,
capturing an enemy piece already there if possible.  If that square is
occupied by a friendly piece, the pawn does nothing.  If the pawn hits
the side of the board, it is deprogrammed and becomes a normal pawn.
[This is really wacky! Great for computer scientists]. 

Well, I'm out of time now.  Happy playing!
