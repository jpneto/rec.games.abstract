This is a real game, called Questions. The basic rule is very simple -
you must carry on a conversation as long as possible only asking questions.
Other rules prohibit rhetorical questions and repetitions of questions
already asked in that game (as we see in the film). The scoring is not
usually done as in a tennis game (although this is a pefectly acceptable
way of scoring): this was done in the film as a wonderful visual joke.

There is also a mirror-image game, called No Questions, where the aim is
to carry on a conversation as long as possible <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>without<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> asking any
questions. This game is a lot more subtle, since conversational strategies
designed to provoke questioning behaviour are more varied than those
designed to prevent it. Try it some time.

Hello! (Damn, can't say "How are you?")
Hello!
What a nice day it is.
Yes, wonderful.
Look at that!
(Don't say "What?"!!) My God! It's...
Incredible!
...

well, you get the idea. It's much harder if you ban imperatives and 
exclamations, too.
