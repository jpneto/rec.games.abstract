If Chris's statement above is true, then it requires both players to 
play randomly before it becomes a game of true luck, and in that case it 
differs little from chess or draughts, if treated with similar contempt 
by the players.

No it just requires one. If I am picking Rock, Paper or Scissors randomly
(with a 1/3 chance each), say by rolling a die, then the what the other
player does won't effect the outcome on average.
Now if one player is not picking random values with uniform distribution or
if there is some correlation between plays, then the other player will in
theory be able to eventually discover this bias (if they play a lot of
games) and try to take advantage of it.
Even if a person doesn't have dice, if they think about it before playing
a series of games, they could probably come up with a system that is good
enough to avoid pattern detection over a few dozen plays.

If just one player chooses to play randomly, then it becomes a sort of 
asymmetrical game - one player is rewarded by skill in pattern matching, 
while the other is rewarded by skill in generating true randomness 
which, as Chris pointed out, isn't as easy as it sounds.

It doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough for the number of times
that you expect to play the game. If you are only going to play a few
dozen times, the random number generation isn't going to need to be that
good.
