David Bush, world champion Twixt player, had this to say about Crossway:
##############
Unable to edit the main page, I wish to mention one game Steere invented, Crossway, which has received critical acclaim, from Paul van Wamelen and from myself, David J. Bush. It is a connection game, with the same object as in Hex or Twixt. It is played on a standard Go board. Such a square grid can present an adjacency ambiguity problem. For example if any 2x2 section of the board is filled with 2 white and 2 black stones such that the same color stones are at opposite corners of this 2x2 section, and both colors are regarded as connected diagonally to each other, the blocking nature which constitutes much of the appeal of a standard connection type game would be lost. Steere's elegant solution is to prohibit such a 2x2 pattern from forming anywhere on the board. The resulting game is very tactical and fast paced, not at all opaque. IMO it is a great game. Of course this is an acquired taste, and many gamers may disagree. I believe a game should not be judged by who invented it, nor how much of the game was actually contributed by the author. I found out about Crossway more by happenstance than anything else. Steere may have other games worth playing, but I am not interested in trying to find out.

Thanks for the link. Nihlus asked to see a well played 
game. Here is the best one I know:

David, I appreciate your critical acclaim of Crossway, but I can't understand why you'd question "how much of the game was actually contributed by the author". Crossway was invented solely by me, Mark Steere, as one might expect from only my name being on the rule sheet.  I also don't know why, after having found out about Crossway "by happenstance" and found it interesting, you feel that "[I] may have other games worth playing, but [you're] not interested in trying to find out."  Here's some more "happenstance" for you, David:

Atoll (invented solely by me, Mark Steere):

David, I respect you as a highly skilled connection games player, and I thank you for your extensive, positive evaluation of Crossway.  But how about a little respect for the designer of a game you enjoy playing?

Next time leave out the isolated, retarded ass comments, will ya?  Thanks in advance.
