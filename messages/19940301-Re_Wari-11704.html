Brian&gt; Greetings and Salutations.  Does anyone know of a game called
Brian&gt; Wari?  I'm not sure of the spelling.  The game involves seeds
Brian&gt; or marbles and usually two players.  The playing board looks
Brian&gt; something like this:

Brian&gt;          ---------------------------------------------------------
Brian&gt;          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
Brian&gt;          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
Brian&gt;          |      -------------------------------------------      |
Brian&gt;          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
Brian&gt;          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
Brian&gt;          ---------------------------------------------------------

Brian&gt;      The object is to get the most seeds/marbles/? in your end
Brian&gt; bin by the end of the game.  A move consists of taking all the
Brian&gt; seeds from one bin and placing one in each bin there after
Brian&gt; until the player runs out of seeds from that bin.  The player
Brian&gt; is able to go again if he/she ends up placing the last seed in
Brian&gt; his/her large bin.  There is also some sort of way to "steal"
Brian&gt; the other players seeds.  

You can steal the seeds in the bin on the other side if
1. your last marble falls in a bin with exactly 0 or 1 marble in it and
2. on the other side, there are marbles in the bin.

You take all the marbles (from your bin and the other one) and place
them in your end bin.

Brain&gt; If anyone knows of any "official"
Brian&gt; rules or of any variants please let me know.  I saw a version
Brian&gt; of this at the Bristol Renaissance Faire and I have been
Brian&gt; interested ever since.

The game ends, if one or both players have no marbles on their side.
The other player (with marbles on his/her side) takes them all and
places them in his/her end bin.

I think that's all you need to play the game.

Brian&gt;                        Thanks in advance!
Brian&gt; 				Brian D.

Bye
	Markus
