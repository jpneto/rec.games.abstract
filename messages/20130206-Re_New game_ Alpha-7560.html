If there's no first move in Redstone that's "bad enough", there certainly must be a set of inititial moves that will suffice.  For example, Black claiming the four corner points in his first four turns should be more than bad enough. 

Basically just limit White's  option to switch to his 3rd turn (or 4th or 5th or however high is necessary) instead of his first turn. 

Or it may be preferable to let White make the switch on any (and only) one of his 1st  to 6th turns.
