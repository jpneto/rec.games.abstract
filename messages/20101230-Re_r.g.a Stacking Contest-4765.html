Hi Christian,

Hello Cameron, good to hear from you. If "Stax" (great name, wonder
why nobody thought of it before!) is as good as its presentation,
we're in for a serious contender :) .
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've learnt that presentation is half the battle :)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I've yet to read the rules carefully and let them sink in, but at first
glance it has the feel of a "chess-like Trax", though Trax of course
has only placement.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes I was aiming for something chess-like (movement and capture with
differentiated pieces) but context free, i.e. no need to learn
specific movement rules for each individual piece as their patterns
define their movement. The end result is sort of an abstracted Hive.

The complete set, including the two asymmetric 3's, is again a subset
of the "China Labyrinth" set:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/puzzles/tilings/china-labyrinth/">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/puzzles/tilings/china-labyrinth/</a>

Interesting! I wasn't wasn't aware of the correlation with the I
Ching. Maybe the two could be combined somehow?

Ralf Gering posted in the chat at iGGC that the name 'Stax' was used
for a stacking game in 1919. Don't know of any details myself but you
may want to ask him about it (or maybe he'll mail you).
Anyway, it's almost a century ago :)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I thought that name was too good not to have been used before.
I searched the web and BGG but couldn't see any evidence of its use,
but if the 1919 author wants to contact me I'll consider changing
it :)

Regards,
Cameron
