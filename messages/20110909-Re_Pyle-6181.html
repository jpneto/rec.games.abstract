Is it called pyle because it is a pyle of sh*t?
anyways, there seems like a lot of ways you can go wrong, and even if
you don't (having a group of 4 on the wrong diagonal as a group of 1
with a group of 3) a well designed fortress by the opponent around one
of your corner pieces could just make it impossible to win.  hell, i'd
probably set up a potential fortress durring the build stage and force
my opponent to give me the other pieces or just flat out accept a draw
on turn one.

It's a habit of mine to publish a game the morning after the night it
came up. Just for fun. If it's not entirely on target, the feedback
will emphasize that soon enough. I got some useful feedback indeed and
modified the game slightly.
