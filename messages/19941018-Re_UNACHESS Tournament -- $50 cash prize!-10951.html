The tournament will take place by email and will begin now. Each player 
will play each other player one game only. All games will be played 
simultaneously, so you each will be playing eight games at once. Use of a 
chess board and any other materials for analysis is allowed and encouraged. 
Players are asked to make their best effort to move quickly; email your 
move the same day you get them or at the latest the next day. There is no 
set time limit, but I reserve the right to set one at a later date if it 
seems needed. 


I will also be playing in the tournament but I am not eligible for the 
prize money.

I won't say who, but one of the players has played several games before and 
is currently undefeated. And its not me.

Here are the game assignments:


                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1  Jason Weiss          - W W W W B B B B
2  Michelle Lepovic     B - W W W W B B B
3  David Scott          B B - W W W W B B
4  Steven Stadnicki     B B B - W W W W B
5  Steve (lastname?)    B B B B - W W W W
6  Mark Thompson        W B B B B - W W W
7  Hugh Denoncourt      W W B B B B - W W
8  Jim Dunion           W W W B B B B - W
9  Edward Jackman       W W W W B B B B -

(If this chart is not clear, for example, player number 4, Steven Stadnicki 
is playing the black pieces against players 1, 2, 3 and 9, and he is 
playing the white pieces against players 5, 6, 7 and 8.)

Thanks to Steve, last name unknown, this tournament is international.


Beginners, remember  --&gt; You cannot capture and your pieces do not give 
check until you put your king down. This is the key rule that gives this 
game its flavor.



Here again is the email format: 
 
 
Starting board: 
 
- - - - - - - -       Black's pieces in reserve: 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -       rrbbnnqk 
- - - - - - - -       pppppppp 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -       White's pieces in reserve: 
- - - - - - - - 
                      RRBBNNQK 
                      PPPPPPPP 
 
 
Example: 
 
 
- - - k - - - r       Black's pieces in reserve 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - -       r-bbn--- 
- - - - - - - -       pppppppp 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - Q - -       White's pieces in reserve: 
- - - - - - K - 
                      RRBBNN-- 
                      PPPPPPPP 
 
 
1. K&gt;h1   n&gt;g2 !+ 
2. Q&gt;g2   k&gt;d8  +
3. Qxf2   r&gt;h8  +
4. K-g1   q&gt;h1  ++  
 
The '&gt;' symbol means a piece is placed from the reserve. 
 
The '-' symbol represents a move of a piece already on the board. 
 
Using an 'x' as in Bxe2 represents a capture. 
 
Using a '+' as in B-e2 + represents check on the opponents king. 
 
Using a '++' or a '#' represents checkmate. 
 
Using a '!+' means 'not' check or virtual check. This means your king has 
not yet been placed so you cannot capture or give check yet, but one or 
more of your pieces is 'aiming' at the opponents king. 
 

Remember, all game moves must be recorded and sent to me upon completion of 
the individual games. Winners should email the results. In case of draws, 
White should email the results. By playing in the tournament, you give me 
the right to publish all game results. At present, I plan to post a summary 
of the tournament to rec.games.abstract, rec.games.chess and possibly 
rec.games.board. In addition, I'll probably write something for NOSTalgia, 
the newsletter for kNights Of the Square Table, a postal game organization.

Also, please make comments and suggestions about the game.



Players, Start Your Games
