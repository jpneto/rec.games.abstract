Has everyone had a brain short-circuit, or what?

This allegedly new game is not greatly different from other attempts
to make a decent connection game on a hexagon, that uses
the alternate-edges-Y condition as the chief win criterion.

In particular, this claim...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
as in Hex, any random filling
of the board always produces one, and only one, winner.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

....is complete nonsense!

The board is almost certain to fill up with both players
getting to create a "Teime", namely one connecting edges A,B,D
and the other edges D,F,A.   (Marking edges cyclically, as obvious.)

That is, both create a winning position, and the one who does it first
wins the game.  It becomes a mere race.  Which we hate.  And in
particular, it essentially becomes a race to sprint across from
one side to the opposite one, in the above case A to D,
(then, in this game, join up to a third).

What on earth is everyone thinking of!!

Of course it is playable, but it's a mere race, and so of no interest
to us true connection-game afficionados, who regard the essence
of a connection game as being its win/loss complementarity,
described in the excerpted comment above.

See my parallel post, "The HEXA-Y problem", for a full account.
