Aloha All,
In the most general terms, from what I understand, one effective
strategy in 8x8 Reversi (Othello) is to try to have as few discs as
possible and to remain in the center of the board.

Is the same true for the 6x6 game?  In the 6x6 games I've played
online, I've seemed to have had more luck when I jump to an edge
whenever possible.  But perhaps it's just that, luck.

I realize 6x6 has been "solved", but assuming I'm human and do not
make the optimal move each turn, is the general strategy of 6x6 also
to remain "centered"?

Thanks,
eKennedy
