To Christian Freeling,

Often is it better not to encourage a DUMB guy because Thicket now A CRAPPY GAME  became like a GO.
ha ha ha 

How can this guy who did not playtested a game widely (he is lying blatantly when he said the game was tested) make such absurd comparison???

ReyAlicea is HIGLY DUMB!!!

My comment was that Rey was 'in the groove', considering his production of new games. I didn't consider the game, but on the face of it the mechanism seemed interesting. I still didn't consider the game but decided to wait till it had morphed into something more stable. I must admit I followed the modifications with some amusement. Tinkertown revisited. Once again it shows that tinkerhappy games lead to nice long threads.

As to encouraging versus finishing off, and sticktly in general terms: a blind man may sometimes catch the hare, a dead man won't. So I encourage other inventors' intentions, even if they won't always materialise as intended.
