It might be too soon to tell.  What is the current draw rate between
top players in Arimaa?  If it is already significant before true
grandmasters have emerged, then it might have a long term problem.
But let's keep in mind that Shogi, which is also infinite on a board
of about the same size, has supported very high level grandmaster play
for centuries with only about a 2% draw rate, without scaling.  It is
still possible that Arimaa might go down the shogi path, or something
like it.  I like Arimaa, while not being very good at it, and I will
hold out some hope that it has staying power.
