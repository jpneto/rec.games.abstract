Most people in this group might already be aware of how skill plays a
part in poker, but if you are not then make sure to visit my web site.
I have been winning at poker month after month for years. I know that
it is a game where skill will win in the long run.I would like poker to
be more widely excepted as a sport. Once you start thinking about the
advanced concepts of poker, wich I will  talk  about some of them in my
website and if you play a little bit so that you can grasp the concepts
better, then you will start to realize how much skill is actually
involved, when playing poker and you might find yourself facing the
challenge of a lifetime.I sure did.Poker is a competitive sport where
the best player will end up with the money in the long run.If you like
to compete or just like a challenge, then you will like playing poker
after you have learned more about it.

My site is new and I have not had the time to edit some pages yet, so
please be understanding of some of the grammar errors you will find.
