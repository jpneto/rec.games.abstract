Well, since their website is now refusing connections, my first guess
would be that they are out of business.

When there have been previous queries on this here or in rec.games.abstract
I have been in touch by email with them and generally had a reply pretty
quickly.   I suggested to them after the last query that they put a message
on the website saying when it would next be updated.  They did in fact do
that and the date they put up was 1st March ... but there has been no
response when I emailed them to say this needed to be updated.   So it
doesn't look good.    Hope things are OK with them.  It (was/is) a great
magazine.
