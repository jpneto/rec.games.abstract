As I understand it, this is Free Y with the provision that a tied game (impossible in that game thanks to the odd number of perimeter cells) is considered a win for the player who occupies the center cell.

I wonder if it would just be preferable to allow the occasional race by awarding the win to the player who made the "winning" chain first in those cases. After all, being the first to occupy the center cell is also a race, and one that the first player always wins (without the pie rule), which means that the first player advantage is necessarily larger here.
