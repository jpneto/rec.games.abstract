Hello,


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The rules of Dao appear to be:

1. Start in this position:

   O . . X
   . O X .
   . X O .
   X . . O

2. X moves first, and then players alternate.

3. A move consists of moving one piece horizontally, vertically, or
   diagonally.  The piece must move at least one space, and must keep
   moving in that direction until it reaches the edge of the board, or
   the next space is already occupied.  (The start position has 16 legal
   moves for X.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is not true. The pieces move like runaway Queens (this is, as far as
possible). For that reason the start position  only has 12 legal moves
for X.
BTW, because of high symmetry, there are only 3 non-identical first moves
possible.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4. A player wins by achieving any of the following.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a horizontal or vertical row.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a 2x2 square.  All four of the player's pieces in
   the four corners.  One of the player's pieces in a corner and the
   three adjacent spaces all occupied by the other player.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The game is very similiar to Advanced Teeko, the American game of
the 1950s, as played according to the tournament rules. Dao also
reminds me of Quixo.
It can well be called a Teeko variant.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
This certainly seems pretty trivial to solve.  I'm guessing it's a draw.

Consider this:


            The first Canadian Dao tournament was held March 31, 2001&gt;
            at the offices of Interconnect in Terrace, B.C.

            Players rotated in games against one another and most of
            the players played everyone else. Dr. Warick Evans is a
            surgeon and he arrived late from working at the hospital
            so not everyone had the opportunity to play him. Dr. Evans
            and Andrew Webber had a long, long game which we finally
            resolved after 45 minutes by giving them each credit for
            1/2 a game.

My comment: A draw.
