The arrogance of that is staggering.  Newcomers to the group might wonder
who Harald Korneliussen is.  Nobody.  He isn't a designer.  Actually he
claims to be one, but he's spent so much time badmouthing everyone else's
games that he's now too embarrassed to reveal his own game.  Korneliussen
doesn't even have the world's most unplayable game to brag about, Bill
Taylor's Projex.  He has nothing, that we know about.

Harald Korneliussen isn't known for his skill as a player.  And, like Bill
Taylor, Korneliussen knows nothing about combinatorial game theory.  The
only thing Harald Korneliussen is known for is making a boob of himself
everywhere he goes.  Typical example: Korneliussen was on bgg literally
interrupting a discussion of the advantage the pie rule affords to Player 2
to inform everyone that it's really Player 1 who has the advantage, because
Player 1 has more time to think about the opening position.  Staggering
ignorance.

Ok, so here we have Harald Korneliussen - interrupting a discussion of
abstract games in rec.games.abstract, a discussion being held by Christian
Freeling, Dieter Stein, Cameron Browne, and Mark Steere - to announce that
the forum is now "beyond help".  Staggering arrogance.
