We have solved roughly 70 billion checkers positions.  This is not quite enough

Checkers has not been solved.  Earlier this year there was a match

Tinsley won 4 games, lost 2 and drew 33 against my program Chinook.
One of Tinsley's wins was on forfeit and another was the last game
of the match (Chinook's last chance to tie the match).  This is not
quite as convincing as you portray.

Just curious, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> using the official checkers rules, aren't you?  That
is, if you are in a position to jump, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>have<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to do it.  I have seen
many checkers programs, but few of them actually implement this rule, which
is very important to the strategy of the offical game.  At least, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
it is an official rule, but having never actually seen the official rules
(where are they anyway), I can't be certain.  Oh well...

I just remember playing checkers and having people think I was crazy when
I said they had to jump...
