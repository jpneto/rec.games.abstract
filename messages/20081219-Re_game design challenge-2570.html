If we're looking for a "points" game where the spread is typically
huge (and therefore draws minimized), there is one that I play often
that fits the criterion well.  The rules:

1.  board=hexhex
2.  two colors of stones.  let's call them red and blue.
3.  on each turn, player fills a cell with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> available color
4.  game ends when board is full
5.  player 1 wins if the product of the sizes of the two largest red
groups is larger than than the same product for blue groups.  If there
is only one group for a color, the final score for that color is zero.

That's a rather cool game!   And, I suspect, one of the few which
is actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>better<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> on a small board than a big one; or rather,
more skillful anyway.  Because on really small boards there
would be a definite subgoal conflict; where the player tries to
keep his groups big to score well, but also keep them small enough
to ensure there are at least two.

Anyway, games where the opponent can move or play <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> pieces
as well as his own are always fun and spritzy.  Chameleon is like
this.

And the genral idea can be modified a little, especially for those who
object to an overtly arithmetical element.  The sum of the sizes of
the top two is simpler, but still with 0 total score for one group.
Even cooler with respect to mixed goals:- win with the biggest
NUMBER of separate groups, with ties going to the biggest single
group!  That would be diabolical.

All of these to be played with the "both can play either" rule.

This is not the first forum that's gone wanky as a result of a-certain-
someone's presence.  Nor is it the second.  There are vivid,
entertaining accounts of past difficulties across the web, if you want
a chuckle.

Wow.  VERY interesting indeed.  But a google search doesn't
seem to help.  Can you tell us what groups to look in, please?
