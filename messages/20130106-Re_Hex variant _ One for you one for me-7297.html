Hey Christian do you know how many game allow the use of opponent pieces?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Actually I don't. There's Luis' Yodd and Xodd of course, and the Stavropol mutator can be applied to several games. But I'm not in the 'inventory' business.

How can you say that in hex there is NO BAD MOVE?
Read the rules carefully!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Maybe I should do that, can you send me a copy?
No really, what I meant is that no red stone will ever actually  <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>hinder<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the red player. It is part of John Forbes Nash's strategy stealing argument that Hex is a win for the first player. What I did <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> mean is that there are no bad moves possible in a game Hex.

INSTEAD OF POINTING THE SIMILARITIES AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SIMILARITIES WITH THOUSAND OF GAMES POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE GAME.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I tried to do just that.

CHRISTIAN YOU ARE A CRAPPY DESIGNER A COPY-PASTER.
WHICH ONE OF YOUR GAME IS ORIGINAL? NOT ONE!!!

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
That may be a matter of opinion, and I thank you for sharing yours. However, I never claimed my games to be original because the qualification has limited significance. Grand Chess, Hexdame and Dameo can hardly lay claim to any originality award. Havannah is a lucky merger, but 'original'? I wouldn't say so. So I don't quite understand what it is about your observations that would justify the use of capital letters throughout.

Unless it is to blend in ;-)
