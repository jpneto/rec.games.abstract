Is it possible to construct a MindNinja-type game pattern,
i.e. a fixed pattern to be decided in advance of playing,
that both players must try to achieve, to be played on
some Hex or Quad board, that STILL has the property
of win/loss complementarity?

I seriously doubt it.

Now OC, there are already games like this, namely "Y"
and its variants.  So I am specifically asking for a game
whose pattern-to-be-achieved is purely LOCAL, as in
5-in-a-row; rather than GLOBAL, as in connection games.

It's not so much local vs global.  Y has a set of possible goals: all
of the patterns that are Y connections.  I think what you're talking
about is a single pattern, which could have any rotation and perhaps
mirrors.

Anyone got any good ideas?

No.  Someday some highly gifted individual will prove it isn't
possible.
