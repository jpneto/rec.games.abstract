 Does anyone have an algorithm for the game Nim ?  I think it
 goes by other names sometimes, so I'll describe it.
 
 You lay out matches or stones or something like this:
 
 
             * * *
           * * * * *
         * * * * * * *
         
 Two players take it in turns to remove any number of stones
 from a single row.  The player to remove the last stone loses.

As Bruno Wolff said, you should definitely look at <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
(by Berlecamp, Conway and Guy).  But here's a capsule summary
of the (really easy) nim algorithm.

The general form of the game has n piles, with sizes s_1, s_2,...,
s_n, and you're allowed in your turn to decrease any one pile by any
amount.  The goal is to make it the other player's turn when all of
the piles have size 0.

Think of the numbers s_1 to s_n as being written down in binary.  Then
the "sum" of all the piles is what you get by taking s_1 to s_n and
xor'ing them together.  (ie, bitwise addition without carry.  In your
example, n=3, s_1=3, s_2=5, s_3=7, so in binary that's 11, 101, 111,
and xor'ing them gives you 001.)

The reason you care about the "sum" is that, in a single move, you
can do the following (trust me for now):

1. If the sum is not 0, in a single move it is always possible to make
   a move so that the sum becomes 0.

2. If the sum is 0, then any move makes the sum non-0.

So to insure a win, you can just make sure that the "sum" is always 0
at the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>end<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of your turn.  (You always can-- that's rule 1 above.)
Then at the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>beginning<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of your turn, the sum can never be 0 (by rule
2 above), so you can never lose.  And in this game, if you never lose,
you win.  Poof.  So in the above case, the "winning moves" are to take
one match from any pile, so the xor becomes 000.  If you play most of
the "commercailly available" variations on this game, things often
start out "just right" so that the xor at the beginning of the game is
0, so it's a second-player-win.

Property 2 is pretty clear, since changing just one number <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>has<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to
change the xor.  To show property 1, just find a pile whose size is
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>larger<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> than that same size xor'ed with the "sum".  Showing that such
a pile always exists is left as an exercise to the interested reader.
