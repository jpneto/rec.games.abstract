I have a large carved wooden game board that my father got in Haiti in
the 1950s. It is like a coffee table with legs, and has carved fish
and animals on one side. On the other side there are 9 round wooden
depressions (like shallow bowls) of various sizes. They are arranged
in 3 rows of 3. He thinks it is designed for some sort of game. Does
anyone know what the game might be and how it would be played? Thanks
very much for any leads. I can e-mail a photo upon request. 
Greg
