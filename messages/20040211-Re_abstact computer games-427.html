But even if you did see all the upcoming tile shapes and where and when

between two or more players.

What if one player chose the shapes, and the other placed them?
That also eliminates the random and/or incomplete information
elements.  You might have to add some restrictions about re-use
of elements to avoid some sort of "obvious best strategy".

Hm.  How about a two-player game in which both players have
boards, and a turn consists of one player choosing a pair of
shapes, then the other player taking one of the pair and giving
the other to the first player, then each player fits the shape
onto their board per the computer-game rules?  Since there are
(I think) seven Tetris shapes (reflections count as different)
so 21 pairs of different shapes.  The players could alternate
which player chooses and which divides, until each pair has
been chosen once, then bring all 21 pairs back and continue.

Not having played a lot of Tetris, I have no idea if there's a
real game in here...

Hmmm...

The two players could start with a fixed set of shapes. Each player
gets to put up a shape for the other to play. When a shape falls
off the bottom in the filled lines, then it gets added to the
available shapes to be given to the other player. Though lines
are hard to do when they happen in the middle. A computer could
keep track of this pretty easily. So if part of a shape is still
on the board it's not available.

So is it really good strategy to keep throwing a particular kind
of shape at your opponent? Because if he fills rows with them he
gets them to throw back at you.  Are there combos that need to be
outlawed because they force holes to be left? How many pieces should
be in the starting set, and of which types? How many shapes are
required when the part-on-the-board thing is kept in mind? Can a
player run out of tiles and not have anything to put up for the
other player? Is that a win? A loss?
