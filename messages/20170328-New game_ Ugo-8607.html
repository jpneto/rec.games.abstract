*** UGO ***

INTRODUCTION

Ugo is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones and kings of their color. There is also a single neutral token called button.

This game is a Go variant where permanent stones are used for capturing. It was inspired by Mark Steere's Redstone, which introduced this mechanism. However, while Redstone freely deviates from Go in a number of ways, my goal with this game was to keep gameplay as close to Go as possible.

DEFINITIONS

A player's group is a maximal set of orthogonally contiguous pieces of that player's color. Stones and kings can be part of the same group.

A liberty of a group is an empty point adjacent to that group.

A player's territory is a set of orthogonally contiguous pieces such that at least one point in the set is orthogonally adjacent to a piece of that player's color, no points in the set are orthogonally adjacent to pieces of the opponent's color and no points in the set are orthogonally adjacent to empty points outside the set.

PLAY

Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must perform exactly one of the following actions:

a) Take the button, provided that none of the players has taken it before.

b) Pass, provided that the button is already taken.

c) Place one stone of their color on an empty point such that the number of groups without liberties remains unchanged.

d) Place one king of their color on an empty point such that the number of enemy groups without liberties is increased, and then remove all stones from all such groups. Lastly, in the resulting position, remove all stones from all friendly groups without liberties.

The game ends when both players pass consecutively.

A player's score is the number of pieces of their color in groups with one or more liberties, plus the number of enemy pieces in groups without liberties, plus the number of empty points in territories of their color, plus half a point if they have taken the button, plus a komi (see below) in the case of White. Whoever has the higher score in the final position wins.

KOMI

The komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides.
