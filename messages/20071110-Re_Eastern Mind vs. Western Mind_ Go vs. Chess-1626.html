     Do you find the notion that board games can establish
habits of mind and frames of reference and can form, reflect and
interpret cultures to be credible?

No, I don't.  That's about the stupidest thing I ever heard.

In the case of both Chess and Go, some individual was probably messing
around with some equipment which was used for some purpose other than
game playing, and discovered the simple mechanism and principle that
would form the basis of the game.  Something resembling a Go board and
Go stones may have been used for divination.  Perhaps one would cast a
handful of variously colored stones onto a board with grid lines and
perhaps divine images, and the resulting arrangement of stones in
relation to the grid lines and images would, for one with sufficient
knowledge of the art, give some indication of future events.  Someone
got to messing around with the stones and discovered the basic
surround and capture principle of Go.  Excited with his discovery, he
quickly worked out the details of an actual game based on said
principle and invited some friends to play.  From there it grew in
popularity.

Something like a Chess board and pieces may also have been used for
divine purposes.  The pieces may all have been of one color to
represent one royal family.  Depending on how the pieces were randomly
cast about, there might be some indication of the fortune of the
actual king, queen, and so on.  In real life you'd probably have only
have one king and one queen inquiring about their own fortunes, but
there may have been several pieces used to represent any number of
knights and bishops and so forth.  One day two different colored sets
came to be on the same board, and someone messing around with them
happened upon the basic mechanism and principle of Chess.  That
person, excited with his discovery, developed a game which probably
resembled the Chess we have today, at least as far as being based on
the slide and capture mechanism.

The reason that the equipment most likely came first and the rules
came later is just that it's a lot more likely that game playing
mechanisms and principles were discovered by someone messing around
with some game-like equipment rather than dreaming up new games using
no equipment whatsoever.  Divination just seems like the most likely
alternative purpose for game-like equipment, at least to me.

Another possibility is that Chess and Go evolved from other games.
But I think it's a reasonable hypothesis that the first games were
developed using some game-like equipment that was originally used for
some other purpose, such as divination.

What I'm getting around to is that a Chess-like game and a Go-like
game were designed by two different individuals, people found them
entertaining, and the games evolved, probably Chess more so than Go,
while retaining their essential identities.  The lineage of games is
certainly interesting but that's all there is to it.  This whole thing
you went into about junior fellows at the Society of Fellows and the
shortcomings of the Chinese intelligentsia is an utterly absurd flight
of fancy.  At least it seems like that to me.
