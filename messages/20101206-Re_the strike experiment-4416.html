@ Corey:
Oops. Memory lapse :P.  Of course it was Nick's contest.  I must have
just lumped it into my brain with r.g.c.

@ Mark:
M: Why 2 pieces?
D: Initially I thought to balance the powerful striking movement and
also speed up the game.  Secondly my flatmate had just mentioned that
he wanted to see a game where one either moves or places 2 pieces.
Also when choosing between placing and flipping, placing one piece
tended to feel like a pretty weak move even when forced (maybe that's
a good thing?) We tested it and it worked so I didn't give it too much
more thought.

M: How often do strikes occur in practice?
D: Quite often both times I played someone, but who knows.  It could
just be the styles of the people playing.

M: Is it possible that a play would be completed without any captures?
D: On a quick glance I'd say no, but let me look into it and I'll get
back to you.  At the end of all possible placements there would be
forced movement and movements can only happen with a capture.  This is
quite possibly a thorn in the game, but yeah... I'll check it out
again. <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fingers crossed<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>

M: Maybe the final group size should be dependent on the board size.
E.g.
group size = board size +2 or something.
D: This is what I had in mind. I 'hardcoded' it for base 8 just for
this ruleset.

M: My attempt at a flipping game ended up being too complicated.

D: Looks interesting. I'll try it when I get a chance.  One thing
which looks frustrating though is the chain reaction aspect of the
flipping.

Thanks for all the feedback :)

@Christian
C: Mark already mentioned this: why two. It shifts play from the
strategical to the tactical and it speeds up the game. Both might be
ok, but I'd make it part of the playtesting (possibly you've already
done that and reached the conclusion that two is better).
D: I had this on my mind, but not so clearly (2/1 vs Tactics/
Strategy).  If strategy becomes more interesting with 1 stone than the
tactics or strategy with 2 then I'll consider changing the rule.

C: There's also the possibility that a striking stone connects two
groups
in the strike: one of a size equal to the lenghts of the strike, the
other not necessarily (and mostly not). Theoretically the str[i]king
stone could even end up touching three enemy groups.
D:  Yes and I can imagine that this would show up later in the game
when one cannot strike a group that it or the group it belongs to is
touching.

C: The resulting group might easily be 'oversized'.
D: Oops.  I figured I'd be too unclear about something in the rules.
I meant a group of 10 or more stones wins.

C: Depending on boardsize, but a hardwired number is arbitrary just
the
same. Nick's own experiments led to 'the largest group' in
'Byg' (second largest if equal and so on). That's not arbitrary and I
find it more elegant.
D: Originally the winner was determined by who had the most stones on
the board once movement became impossible.  After one game of that, I
never wanted to fill the board again with this game.  I thought to
make it so that whoever has the largest group in the end wins, but
then determining the end of the game by the filling of all of the
spaces freaked me out once again.  Choosing some number which fit the
size of the board, and skipping that horrible end game sounded more
fun

C: True, the LOA idea in a new jacket. That's the focuspoint, but you
might want to take a closer look at the right kind of filler.
D: Of course.  That's why I'm here. :)

C: I agree. It has the basic ingredient for a dramatic game, but I'd
not
be satisfied with the filling just yet. Arbitrary object and the
possibility of 'oversized' groups by simultaneously striking a size-X
group while connecting to a friendly group. I'd look for something
that solves both of those simultaneously.
D: Thanks for your feedback! Much appreciated.

rule clarification: A stone cannot strike a group that it or the group
it belongs to is touching.

@ Bill

B: Oh blimey Daniel - this is bad luck!   Both Stark and his sugar
daddy like
your new game.  That's a bad sign.
Still, it probably has a lot of good points anyway.  If I have any
constructive
comments I'll post them to r.g.c.     Stay tuned!

D: Nobody said they liked the game and you're welcome to make your
comments here.
