|&gt; Hi folks,
|&gt; 
|&gt; has anyone ever thought of leaving the world of procedural gaming and maybe
|&gt; design a game, which is of a declarative nature?

Last year we started playing some LP-based games in our Faculty. One of them
is about unification and one possible set of rules is the following:

	- Two players share a finite set of free variables. 
	- There is a finite number of functors of different arities (possibly 0)
	which can be used as long as you want to build terms using those variables.
	- Every move, each player adds some non-trivial equation X=t where X is a
	variable from the original set and t is a term built from the functors and
	the variables in the original set. The equation must not be redundant with
	the previous ones nor lead to an unsolvable system. Dont worry about
	occur-check, i.e. cycles are allowed.
	- The player who cannot make a legal move loses.

As you can see, this is nothing else than some abstract version of nim-like
game. These are some sample games:

Vars={X,Y,Z}	F={k/0,f/2}
1. X=k
2. Z=f(X,Y)
3. Y=k ++

or:
1. X=f(Y,f(Z,X))
2. X=f(k,f(k,X)) ++


I dont know if this is the sort of stuff you thought about. My idea is
that in a declarative game players no longer act transforming some game-state
but play by adding constraints to a description. The previous one is rather
abstract but can be syntactic-sugared to give it some sense. 

A different game is to add simple formulae to a conjunction. You can use, for
instance, propositional logic. There is a finite set of propositional
variables p,q,r,s... Moves can be restricted to asserting the truth or falsity
of a variable or stating an implication, e.g. 
	- p
	- ~q
	- p -&gt; q	etc.
Every move must not be tautological nor lead to contradiction. Again, this is
another variation of nim --think about the Disjunctive Normal Form of the
accumulated conjunction-- and even a graph game --see, for instance Martin
Gardner's book on Logic Machines and Diagrams. It's easy to see that the 2nd
player has a winning strategy with just 2 prop. vars., p and q. The game gets
more and more complicated as the number of vars grows --checking
satisfiability is NP-complete.

Of course, if you use First Order Logic instead you can play any known game...
The question is, is there a new world of games when using higher-order logics?
