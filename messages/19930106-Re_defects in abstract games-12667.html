in my opinion, you have hit upon what i think is the most undesirable
aspect of chess.  the huge number of drawn games in proportion to the
decisions is tiresome at best.  it is, however, a nasty problem to fix.
so nasty it might be better off left alone.  in the recent fischer-
spassky match, with the new fischer clock in place and with fischer
known to hate draws, there were still 15 out of 30 games drawn - and
that is a lower ratio...one of those karpov-kasparov matches had a
huge number of draws due to the change fischer brought about by not
having draws count for 1/2 points anymore.  it is the smallness of the
board and the limitations on the piece's movements that creates a
balance of power that makes it easier to defend, relatively, than to
kill.  thus to reduce the draws, the game would need drastic alterations
that may make it unrecognizable to its former incarnation.

go would not be improved by a whole integer komi or perpetual check
draw, again, in my opinion.  hey, this is another thing basketball
has over hockey.  i just dont like draws in general.  others may
disagree.

The draw-decision question has a tradeoff --- decisiveness of a victory.

Whereas hockey is prone to draws, basketball's large amount of scoring
degrades the signifigance of any particular score.  The same distinction
is even more pronounce in chess and go.  Go works in a huge number of
tiny gradations, whereas chess has a single, definative checkmate.

Which you prefer is entirely a matter of taste, and the suggestion that
these gradations somehow make go more "complex" or that a larger number
of moves in the search tree make the game more "challenging" are just
insulting.  On the latter point, not all moves are created equal, and the
equation of placing a stone in go to the move of a pawn in chess is 
asinine, or suggest the "search tree size" is a particular bonus sounds
rather like adolescent males worrying about how their penises "measure
up" more than anything worthy of interest.

Remember that rock-paper-scissors is more complex and challenging than
both go and chess in it's own way, and has a "search tree" of three.
Also there are games with an infinitely large search tree which are
quite simply trivial.

I hope that doesn't sound like a mad chessman defending his game.  The
only reason I limited my attack to go is that while the "Go is better
than chess" contigent has reared it's ugly head, the counterpart from
chess's fan club have been thus far silent (or absent at least).

Trying to justify game preference logically is a futile proposal, and we
can do without the psuedo-logic that comes from the attempt.
