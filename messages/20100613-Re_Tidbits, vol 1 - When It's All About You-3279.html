on bgg, Freeling wrote to Hutnik:

In the usual way I might add, braying "Iago ... Iago ... Iago ...Iago"
and posting remarkable insights such as "I personally would say YES
Strip Checkers would be suitable under IAGO technically."


I give Freeling credit for this.  I started the thread out of respect
for Freeling's games, and wasn't happy with Hutnik's self-serving and
ridiculous posts.  I would have jumped in and said so myself, but I've
decided to avoid arguing with the man if possible, since it seems to
accomplish nothing.
