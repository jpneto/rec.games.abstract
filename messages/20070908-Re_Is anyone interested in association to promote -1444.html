Hi Rich,
I am Luca, in Italy I and other players, keen of abstract game, have
made the Abstrakt project.
The aim of this project is the diffusion in Italy of the play culture
and the abstract games.
But we don't "combat" the other games and we don't think that the
abstract game are "second-class citizens".
A question, what is the meaning of "championship at Origins" ?
You want a world abstract strategy champion, which games  will be
played?

I suggest you this site <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/</a> where you can
play a lot abstract games.

ciao

Luca
