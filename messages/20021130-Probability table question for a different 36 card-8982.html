I recall discussion of Settlers, where, instead of dice, it was
suggested that there be a deck of 36 cards representing every
permutation of dice rolls to come up.  This approach is to insure an
even distribution of dice rolll results to balance things out.

Ok, my question is this:  Let's say, we have a deck of 36 cards.  The
deck consists of 6 cards of each possible die roll on a 6 sided die
(1-6), for 36 cards (6 1's, 6 2's, etc...).  The cards are shuffled
and TWO cards are flipped over and a die roll result is generated. 
What would the odds distribution be for doing this?  Would it be the
same as standard dice rolls or different?  I am curious, because I was
interested in kicking this around as a new way to generate two six
sided dice rolls.
