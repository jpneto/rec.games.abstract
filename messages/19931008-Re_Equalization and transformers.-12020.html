Most board games have a noticeable advantage to the first player. Just recently
I mentioned a method of "equalizing the advantage" between the players, (or
rather removing the advantage), that I had posted about some time earlier.

So:  EQUALIZATION:  To remove the first- (or second-) move advantage, while
                    leaving us playing essentially the same game.

My favorite method, which seems to work for almost all board games, is...

"3-move equalization"
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One player, the "Placer", plays a (legal) move for first-mover, then one for
second-mover, then another for first-mover. The other player, the "Chooser", 
then decides on the basis of the board state obtained, whether he wants to
be second-mover (and continue with the next move), or first-mover (and let his
opponent continue).

So the Placer is under some pressure to play three moves that leave "exactly"
equal chances, and the Chooser must try to find a flaw in this attempt. (The
question of who gets to be Chooser can be determined by lot; or in a match,
alternately).  This seems such a good method to me that I wonder it has never
been the rule in special tournaments. It would have the further advantage (e.g. 
in chess) that standard opening theory would not become quite so over-analysed.

I've been considering how to extend this to n-person games, and I
think the following will work:

For simplicity's sake, I will only demonstrate for three player games,
but the generalization should be obvious.  And I will only use a
one-move equalizer.  But it could be done, I think, with Nm-eq for any
N.  Assume that normally Blue moves first, then Red, then Yellow.  

First, Player 1 makes a move for Blue.  Then Players 2 and 3 say
whether or not they'd like to be Blue.  If both say no, then Player 1
is Blue and the other two use the I-cut-You-choose-first method above
to decide who is Red and who is Yellow.  (With Player 2 as Placer,
making a Red move.)  If just one of them says yes, then she is Blue,
and the other one becomes Placer, moving Red.  If they both say yes,
then Player 1 is Yellow and Player 2 makes a move for Red; then Player
3 gets to choose between Red and Blue.

This still perhaps leaves the psychological advantage to the third
player, but I think it does for a large class of games make the game
even.  Has anyone seen other variations?
