	Perhaps some minor modifications to the rules would tip the balance
in favor of offense. For those of you who also see the current rules as being
badly balanced, let the rest of us know how you've improved them!

We had the problem of both getting locked in two defense postures for
a while, but then we got over it. Things that we tried to make the
game more aggressive included:
  1) Use three players. I like the two player version better, but with
three players there just isn't enough room (or marbles) to form a
block that is 3 across in all directions. To even out the three player
game, we also added the rule that you needed at least three marbles
from each of your opponents. Otherwise, it was too easy to pick on the
person who was in the weakest position to get all six marbles from
them.
  2) Remove the rule about only being able to move three marbles at a
time. This gets interesting quickly as one side forms the infamous 5
pushes 3 move... My impression was that this rule tipped the balance
too much toward agression. There was no incentive to trying to huddle.
Why would there, when you can just form a bigger line and attack?
  3) Add a rule that if you can push, you must choose one of the
pushes. It corresponds to the rule that makes checkers
interesting. This one works pretty well, but makes it very hard to
foresee what will happen. It is very easy to miss the fact that you
just gave your opponent exactly one push and therefore they will not
take the "natural" move. What it means is that you can break your
opponent's formation by putting a marble in front of it and making him
attack. Fun stuff.

Let me know how any of these work for you.
