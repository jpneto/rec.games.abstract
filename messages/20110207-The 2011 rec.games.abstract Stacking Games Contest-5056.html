With permission, I have just completed programming 3 of the 7 games
(including my own) entered into the stacking games contest. I focused
on these 3 mainly because they all limit the stacks to pieces of a
single type which greatly simplifies the programming and graphics. I
would have liked to implement them all, but due to the time and
complexity involved, I will likely not have the time do go further.

I have therefore created the following web page where these games can
be downloaded:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html">http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html</a>

In addition, if anyone would like to add additional resources to this
page (e.g. print &amp; play downloads, links to applets), please contact
me and I will add them to this page.
