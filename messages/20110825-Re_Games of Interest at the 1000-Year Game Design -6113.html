That's right. So, when you form a diagonal pair, you can play an
opponent stone nearby...

.... to not only increase your opponent's group count, but actually
ensure the connection of your own stones!

There should be more interesting tactical patterns like this to be
found in Xodd. It may well turn out to be better than Yodd, after
all...

Well, those are facts. The point is whether they favor the game or
not. Let's see:

- As there will be more groups at the end of the game, differences in
score can be higher, and so slight differences in skill are more
likely to become apparent.

- More tactics could be a good thing in a game where stones are never
removed from the board.

Just speculating. It's easier to predict a good gameplay in Yodd,
because you can interpolate from a fair bunch of connection games on a
hex board. For Xodd, more experience will be needed.

If thick chains are too difficult to make, and are needed for
territories to pay off, then Xodd won't likely work. On the contrary,
if diagonally connected chains ensure the creation of more opponent
groups than are in the chain, or it's likely that you'll be able to
solidly connect a fair amount of them, then Xodd could be great. Of
course, it's the same for both players, so this objections may well be
irrelevant (?!?).

A large part of the answer must lay on the specific tactical tricks
provided by the square grid.
