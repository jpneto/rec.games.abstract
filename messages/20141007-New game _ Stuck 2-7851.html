This game was in fact a new formulation of Struck. Sorry for the name : it is Stuck not Struck (I made a mistape by adding "r")

After failing to find a game not sensitive to mirroring strategy (see game : Struck) I tried to rethink it.
Here is my new game based on the same mechanics

I hope that for this one it will be little bit hard to find if it is first player win or second or draw.

Very important : this game could be played using only pens and paper.

Thank you for any comment.

Enjoy the game! 

Ps : Other games will be published later using sticks and tokens. I decided to start from some predefined board and materials to create a new game. At the same time I will introduce new mechanics (when I said new that means that I tried to google lot of games before saying new. I could be wrong because I do not know all the games published either on Internet or somewhere else).
