<BODY bgColor=#ffffff><FONT face=Arial size=2>After several months of analysis, 
Edward &amp; I have come up with a possible<BR>variant of the 5x5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe 
game that may work for everyone.&nbsp; I'd like<BR>both positive and negative 
feedback.<BR><BR>Edward demonstrated the 'strong draw' nature of the basic 
version of this<BR>game by giving me 3 moves to start and was able to block my 
best attempts at<BR>winning.&nbsp; We quit about 1/2 way through the game after 
all the main lines<BR>were blocked by him.&nbsp; Of course he was only 
demonstrating a certain style of<BR>play where the 2nd player was hell bent on 
creating a draw.&nbsp; This is kind of<BR>unordinary for about 99.95 percent of 
the play I have witnessed with my<BR>board game called "Pentagonal" in the test 
market. (That will be changed to<BR>'3D5' or 'Figure Five' for the mass 
production commercial version).<BR><BR>Now I'm cognizant of the fact that many 
games have been 'killed' by you<BR>people by ripping them apart and reducing 
them to a simple algorithm that<BR>removes all attraction to playing them at 
all.<BR><BR>But I believe we have found the solution that may make some of 
you'all think<BR>a bit.<BR><BR>My original variant was to use a single 
'free-space' in the center of<BR>matrix, which has the most lines or planes 
passing through it (11).&nbsp; While<BR>this is sufficient for most players, it 
was not enough to create a game<BR>suitable for tournament play.&nbsp; ("F" 
stands for 
'Free-space')<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

. . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . .</FONT><BR><BR>So what we 
have come up with is an extension of the free-space concept.&nbsp; The<BR>center 
space should still always be a free-space, unless you are playing a<BR>novice 
and want to give them somewhat of an advantage.&nbsp; But here is 
the<BR>interesting part: the difficulty of this game can be adjustable.&nbsp; 
Both<BR>players then start alternately placing free-space pieces on any 
position<BR>they like, accept you cannot create more than 3 free-spaces on any 
line (or<BR>obviously the 2nd player would win).&nbsp; It appears that 5 may be 
sufficient,<BR>but this may be incorrect.&nbsp; Once one player wants to start 
playing, they<BR>place their piece down, but using yet another equalizing rule, 
the other<BR>player can then replace this piece with their own.&nbsp; Play then 
continues in<BR>the traditional fashion, but since there are probably several 2 
space lines<BR>in several directions, it is probably unproductive to try and 
just play the<BR>blocking game by either player.&nbsp; It is most fun when both 
players are<BR>playing to win anyway!<BR><BR>The question still in our minds is 
this.&nbsp; Just how many free spaces does it<BR>take to satisfy the true 
analytic minds out there?&nbsp; Edward had proposed that<BR>all of the major '6' 
spaces be made into free-spaces:<BR><BR><FONT

continue the above game, you will see the first-move-win<BR>nature of this 
configuration.<BR><BR>Edward also has suggested an interesting 
pattern:<BR><BR>&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

. F . F .&nbsp;&nbsp; . . F . .&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . .<BR></FONT><BR>but we have 
not played this configuration yet.&nbsp; Edward has also come up with<BR>a 
rather unique concept in making the outside of the matrix a 'virtual<BR>wrap', 
where one side is connected to the other side, or top to bottom, and<BR>making 
it a 4 in a row game, thereby circumventing a middle block, but I<BR>don't think 
that will work very well.<BR><BR>So if any of you care to exercise your analytic 
prowess and figure out the<BR>best range of the number of free-spaces needed, 
you may get a free copy of<BR>the game board matrix I have patented and is in 
the final production run of<BR>500 (out of 2500 total).<BR><BR>I feel it is 
between 5 and 9, but Edward thinks it is more.&nbsp; Thank you so<BR>much for 
your detailed help Edward, and I have officially rewarded him with<BR>a 1/4% 
interest out of my share of the game, which I leave to you to do the<BR>math on 
a $7.50 - 8.50 wholesale price.<BR><BR>By the way, the new manufacture, Atomic 
Toys of San Diego, will be<BR>incorporating at least five different game rules 
into the instructions which<BR>we plan on unveling at the 2003 New York Toys 
Fair.<BR>(See ya there Scott Pardee)&nbsp; We are still open to 
suggestions.&nbsp; I am<BR>personally trying to get him to make figurines to 
make a variation of the<BR>1926 'Elf Chess' game, but I don't really like the 
use of a "Unicorn" piece,<BR>and am more inclined to use 4 knights 
instead.&nbsp; Currently we are thinking of<BR>a 3-D "Reversi", a 3-D Chinese 
Checker-like game, where the bottom layer is<BR>one color and the top the other, 
a 5x5x5 "Stone Push" game, a 3-D 'Atomic<BR>pattern' type thing that isn't 
really a game, so there's still room for<BR>suggestions!<BR><BR>I feel this 
board matrix may be viewed as an abstract "deck of cards" that<BR>can accomodate 
numerous games, most of which have probably not yet been<BR>invented yet.&nbsp;
