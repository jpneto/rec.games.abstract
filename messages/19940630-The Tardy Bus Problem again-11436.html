Here's a logic puzzle for those of you who missed it the first time. It is
taken from the beginning of the instruction manual to the game WFF'N'PROOF
by Layman E. Allen. Note: the words "if", "then", "and", "or", and "not"
have a very precise meaning here. I will post the answers IF anyone expresses
to me an interest in seeing them. :)

The Tardy Bus Problem.

Given the following statements as premises:

1) If Bill takes the bus, then Bill misses his appointment, if the bus is
   late.

2) Bill shouldn't go home, if (a) Bill misses his appointment, and 
   (b) Bill feels downcast.

3) If Bill doesn't get the job, then (a) Bill feels downcast, and
   (b) Bill should go home.

Is it valid to conclude:

Q1 that if Bill takes the bus, then Bill does get the job, if the bus
   is late?

Q2 that Bill does get the job, if (a) Bill misses his appointment, and
   (b) Bill should go home?

Q3 that if the bus is late, then (a) Bill doesn't take the bus, or Bill
   doesn't miss his appointment, if (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q4 that Bill doesn't take the bus, if (a) the bus is late, and
   (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q5 that if Bill doesn't miss his appointment, then (a) Bill shouldn't go
   home, and (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q6 that Bill feels downcast, if (a) the bus is late, or
   (b) Bill misses his appointment?

Q7 that if Bill does get the job, then (a) Bill doesn't feel downcast, or
   (b) Bill shouldn't go home?

Q8 that if (a) Bill should go home, and Bill takes the bus, then
   (b) Bill doesn't feel downcast, if the bus is late?
