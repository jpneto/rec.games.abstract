Posted this accidentally in the Jump Sturdy thread, so once again:

The Soar applet now allows for a swap. Introducing a swap is the only
tweak the game got, but the rather sloppy way in which the rules were
initially presented has undergone some improvement thanks to several
suggestions that came in. Thanks for that, I had written them down
off
the top of my head and the result was rather sloppy indeed. Hope
they're unambiguous now.

I played Soar for the first time today with my flatmate... and since
'Pommel' got some flack for sounding strange in Dutch.  I'll just say
that after mentioning the name Soar in conversation a bit it starts to
sound a bit Herpes-ish :D

I found it really (really) cool that rules can emphasize the landscape
texture of a common checkerboard (in this case referring to stack
height).  ...salting the soup so to speak.

The explosions are very entertaining.  I've never seen this before.
I liked this game more than the new racing game.

For anyone who hasn't made it to the rule sheet I'll summarize:
It's played on a 6x6 checker board.
Each player gets 12 pieces of their color.
The object is to capture your opponent's 12 pieces.
Either place a piece on an empty space or move a piece.
Capture is by replacement.
When a stack reaches a certain height a capture happens
If enough of your stones are present for the capture then there's an
explosion!
The explosion is mostly harmless.  It pretty much just makes a mess
for your opponent to have to deal with.
Movement is based on stack height, but because there's a textural
rooftop on the checkerboard the counting doesn't get out of hand at
all.  At most you'll have a height 3 to deal with.
cool game.  I look forward to trying it again.

about the applet... I hope you don't mind the feedback, but it's hard
to tell who is what color unless you look at the chat below... er...
it's not obvious anyway.  Also I wasn't able to send a message without
making a move.
