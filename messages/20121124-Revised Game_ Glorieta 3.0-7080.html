A new invention:

While a revision of a game isn't usually a notable event, this one is more noteworthy than other revisions I've posted, because in more or less completely restructuring this game, I employed mechanics which I believe are a) new; and importantly b) have broad potential for application beyond this particular game.

Two novel mechanisms:

1. The use of neutral stones to make loop formation inevitable. The interest here is that the same mechanism can make a wide range of other patterns viable as game goals that aren't possible by any other mechanism I know of. 

2. The employment of a hand of stones. While hands of items like cards are among the oldest game mechanics, Ive not seen the concept applied to a no-luck, perfect-info, abstract game. It strikes me that theres great scope for innovation here. "Hands" allow you to enforce variety of turn/move types, of many different kinds, in an intuitive way. For example, you can force players to make sequences of hot and cold moves, as is the case in Glorieta: flipping a stone is a cold move, but placing stones are hot moves, and in Glorieta you have a hand of stones to ensure you make a cold move on a certain percentage of your turns. The concept of hands is such a general and generally unused idea in abstract games that I plan explore it heavily in future games.
