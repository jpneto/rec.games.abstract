Think Small seems to have dynamics similar to Radio Call-in contests 
where the Nth caller with the answer is the winner.  I'd like to
try this out.  

I am starting another contest.  The winner of this contest is the one
who sends me the 2nd-smallest real number between, but not including,
3 and pi.  For the sake of revealing game dynamics, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>please<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> Cc: me
any scheming that you do over e-mail.  Also inform me as to any other
actions that you take regarding this game.  (i.e. Using the phone,
seeing the last time someone read mail, &amp;c...)  I am not a contestant.
Neither, to my knowledge, is anyone who knows me.  No one will receive
any help from me.  I am <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> curious as to what this might turn out
like.

If only one person answers, there will be no winner.  Scheming is strongly
encouraged.  Back-stab all you want.  It's all a part of the game.  
I will compile everything and post what happens to this group.

Send all entries by e-mail.  You may post your entry, but the entry
must be emailed to be considered official.  Notation for the number
must be explicit enough so that I could write a computer program to
reproduce it exactly in finite time, then HALT.  (i.e. Nothing like 3.0 + 
10E-[number of atoms in the universe])  

Entries must include: "Contest, Think 2nd" in the subject line.  

Entries too large to fit into a single e-mail message will be 
disqualified.  All disqualified entries will be notified &amp; given 
at least one chance for correction.

Cut-off postmark time is Midnight on Dec. 1, 1992.  Corrections may be
sent in afterwards, provided that the initial entry was sent in before
the first deadline.  The legality of all entries is at the discretion
of the judge.  (Me)
