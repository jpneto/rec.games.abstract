|David, how do you feel about The Game of Y, Poly-Y, Havannah,
|Superstar, and *Star, all of which are derived from Hex?  My impression

|of Hex for elegance, but exceed it in strategic complexity.  And I'd

|game, I assume) a better game than Hex or the aforementioned.

Y comes in two flavors. "Official" Y from Kadon has three interior cells
with just five neighbors instead of six. The reason given for this,
aside from the beautiful and not easily reproducible board, is that in
plain vanilla triangular Y, less of the board is used, since the
corners are much less important than the central region. In the Kadon
version, the corner points have three neighbors instead of just two.
But when they made this change, they paid a price in terms of game
balance. Of course, the pie rule is recommended for both versions.
But what good is the pie rule, if EVERY initial move should be swapped?
I would swap any initial move, including a corner move, in Kadon's Y.
And I believe I would have a decent advantage as a result. I certainly
would not swap an initial corner move in triangular Y. I regard
triangular Y as a better game than official Y.

I also like Hex better than triangular Y. A greater percentage of the
board tends to get filled up, in a good game. Also there are lots of
strong opponents available for Hex, both in real time and turn based.
That may not have anything to do with the games themselves, but it
affects my opinion.

I haven't played Poly-Y, Superstar, nor *Star, although I do have a
*Star set. *Star does look way cool, and I would enjoy some real
time games. A variant ruleset, which came with the game, is *Star Y.
The object there is to connect three of the five sides, with the
proviso that one of the sides must not be adjacent to either of the
other two. You also win if you connect more than three sides. The
central star cell is used in this variant. Again, way cool, but I
haven't played a game, so I cannot judge.

Havannah is a whole other beast. It probably is a fundamentally deeper
game than Hex or Twixt, as are plenty of other abstracts. I don't
see ahead very well in Havannah. It's not completely a connection game
in my opinion, more a hybrid connection and pattern forming game.

Twixt is vastly more tactical than Hex. It's much more difficult to see
ahead, but that makes the view all the more rewarding. One player called
it a knife fight in a phone booth. Some fine judgement is required in
the opening moves. After that, your job is to tactically justify the
plan which you are now stuck with. Hex is more tactically monotonous,
and there are some stages where the moves by both sides are rather
predictable, but occasionally you might find a "bolt from the blue," a
completely unexpected move to win. Hex has a better overall balance
between tactics and strategy, and certainly a greater percentage of
the board gets filled up. I guess I like tactical variety, especially
when I am successful at it. That's why Twixt is my #1 game.

Unlur is another cool variant, which I played a few times on the
Ludoteka real time server. There's a real hump in the learning curve
there, perhaps even bigger than for Twixt. It takes a lot of experience
to judge the right moment to take the black pieces. Strong players will
always keep in mind that there are two ways to win: Form your connection,
OR force the opponent to form your connection pattern with his stones.
I like Unlur a lot, but I don't play it much these days.
