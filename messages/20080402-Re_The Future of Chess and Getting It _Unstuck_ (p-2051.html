<br><blockquote type=cite>This is a philosophical piece for the most part meant to give thought
<br>to where things can head, and why.&nbsp; I will acknowledge that this is
<br>potentially heresy to those who live and die FIDE chess and consider
<br>it handed down from the divine as some immutable set of rules that is
<br>meant to last FOREVER.&nbsp; It is a piece to ponder, refute, consider
<br>insane, or thought of value.&nbsp; I am not going to lay out here the exact
<br>form, but lay out what I believe is a direction chess could in that
<br>would be worth considering.&nbsp; Please DON'T cross-post this to politics,
<br>and try to keep it as a philosophical discussion.&nbsp; For those who think
<br>this is off, look at the changes that have been made to chess.&nbsp; The
<br>clock has been played with and so on.&nbsp; Scoring on the tournament level
<br>has been considered also.&nbsp; It goes on and on.&nbsp; Anyhow, onto the core
<br>of the document.
<br>
<br>I believe the framework of chess can be addressed now so that we never
<br>turn chess into a solved game.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I don't think solvability has any practical connection to how good a game
<br>is. If a chess variant is good, it will be for other reasons.
