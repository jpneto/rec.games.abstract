And now a full 2 dan Go player has decided to give

you do it? :D

I'm still bowled over that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>anybody<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> wants to play Redstone.  I don't care
if they've got two Gregs and a Sally.  Why the Redstone rancor?  :)

You played a minor role in a major event, Luis - maybe the only significant
event to ever take place in rec.games.abstract.

Rec.games.abstract Significant Time Period:
1. Christian Freeling abruptly terminated the Bill Taylor era.
2. Designers came out like mammals after the dinosaurs.
3. New designers joined rec.games.abstract.
4. Luis helped make Redstone a major phenomenon.
5. Go is a game of aggression.
6. Go should end in annihilation, not territorial nitpicking.
7. Now it rightfully does in the form of Redstone.
8. Redstone play spontaneously breaking out at L19 was humbling.
9. Redstone's profound significance is still dawning on me.
