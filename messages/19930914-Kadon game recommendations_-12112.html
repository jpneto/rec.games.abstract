I recently received the 1992-93 brochure from Kadon Enterprises and
can't believe all the fascinating games they have!  I'm thinking of
getting either Octiles or Hexmoziax because I really like Kaliko and
these both appear to have similar properties, yet be different enough
to make them interesting in their own right.  Does anyone have any
opinions about these?
 
Also, The brochure claims there are puzzles and several games or game
variations for just about all they offer, but some of these appear to
be more suited as puzzles than games.  In particular, does Hexmoziax
make a good game?
 
And, can anyone tell me more about their flagship game, Quintillions?
Are there any other games from Kadon that you would recommend?
 
Thanks for your input!
