And I'm suprised you mention Gess here, since I've never heard of
it :-) I have heard of Arimaa and Havannah, though, and my impression
is that the only reason these "designed for humans" games haven't been
beaten by computers yet is that so few are working on it. No game
deserves the label computer resistant unless academic programmers have
been working on it for at least ten years, IMO.

Let's see if the prize for Arimaa gets over $100,000.  That might do
things.  Anyhow, a game like Go faces issues regarding the AI being
able to beat it.

What will be interesting is if you start doing games where players can
fundamentally alter the game rules to hinder their opponent, and then
challenge the AI to do that.  The rule changes are set up to
strengthen or weaken what the players do go at.  In other words, it is
more playing the player than the board.  To this end, will an AI be
able to keep up with humans, and can such a game be a true abstract
strategy game?
