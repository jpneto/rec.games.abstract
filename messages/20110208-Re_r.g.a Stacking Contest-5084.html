As far as who gets to vote, my concern is controlling multiple

Can those poll pages offer any help in that respect? I'm sure we're
not the first to discuss that possibility.

So Bill Taylor could sink MQ, at the cost of what? And achieving what?
It's not that you can hide '200 sockpuppets', assuming you can get so
many being Bill Taylor. If being exposed it wouldn't raise his
popularity either, and BT is very concerned about that.

I think my long time
record of participation in abstract games, and also being an inventor,
although not of a game in the contest, makes me qualified to vote
impartially (and yes, despite my negative relationship with Corey, I
highly respect Particle Bond and would objectively evaluate anything
he entered), but I would also accept a more strict process of limiting
voting.

But not as strict as to be a tea party among inventors. If this is to
be a yearly event, voting should be possible for all interested in
abstract games, or else it would miss its target.
