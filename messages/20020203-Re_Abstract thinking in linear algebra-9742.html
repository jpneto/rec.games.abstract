Perhaps later down the road. Students find concepts such as

"vector spaces", 
"subspaces", 
"axioms", 
"general inner product",
"linear transformation in a general vector space" 
and others

quite abstract. Also, the students are deprived of 
(shielded from? protected from?) formal proofs in Calculus.
Frankly, when I came to North America, I found the very 
existence of Calculus shocking, with its cookbook approach. 
Why do they avoid Year I Real Analysis? (That study would, 
by the way, do away with many misunderstandings about 0
.999... and other phony issues.)

:Why do they
:make you go through Calculus before taking linear algebra? 

That depends on your school's Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.
In our school, these two subjects are offered concurrently.
Some schools may adopt the condescending attitude "you know, the
students are not ready for linear algebra". 

:And what's the difference between linear and normal algebra?

I will not guess what "normal" algebra is. In today's terminology,
linear algebra is simply a part of algebra. In high-school speech,
"algebra" can, and should, contain teaching skills useful for 
handling problems from Calculus and from Linear Algebra, as well 
as from more advanced subjects.

Hope it helps, ZVK(Slavek).
