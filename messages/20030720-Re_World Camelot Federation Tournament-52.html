Intriguing.  Here's a boiled-down version of the rules.

The board looks like this.

   ABCDEFGHIJKL

 1      XX
 2   ********
 3  **********
 4 ************
 5 ************
 6 **KMMMMMMK**
 7 ***KMMMMK***
 8 ************
 9 ************
10 ***kmmmmk***
11 **kmmmmmmk**
12 ************
13 ************
14  **********
15   ********
16      xx

K = white knight
M = white man
X = white castle square (initially unoccupied)
k = black knight
k = black man
x = black castle square (initially unoccupied)

Any piece may move, which works like a king in chess.

Any piece may canter, which works like a jump-series in Chinese
Checkers (but with eight possible directions instead of six).  The
piece may only jump over friendly pieces, and it may not start and
end the canter in the same square.  A knight's canter may not bring
it next to an opposing piece at any point along the way, unless the
canter is part of a knight's charge (see below).

Any piece may jump, which works like a jump-series in checkers
(but with eight possible directions instead of four).  If any
jumps are possible, then the player must start some jump, and
keep that one going as long as possible.  This requirement is
lifted if your previous turn left one of your pieces on a friendly
castle square (see below).  If you fail to perform a required jump,
or fail to keep it going as long as possible, then your opponent
may choose to force a correction or let it stand.

A knight may perform a knight's charge, which works like a canter
followed by a jump.  This may be used to satisfy a requirement to
jump, but the possibility of a knight's charge does not create a
requirement to jump.

You win if you occupy both opposing castle squares, or if your
opponent has no pieces and you have at least two pieces, or if
your opponent cannot move and you have at least two pieces.

You draw if both players have less than two pieces, or by agreement
of both players, or when a position appears for at least the third
time with the same player to move (and this is pointed out), or when
each player has made 50 moves without any captures or moving onto an
opposing castle square (and this is pointed out).

You may not move, canter, or canter-during-a-knight's-charge onto a
friendly castle square.  You may jump or jump-during-a-knight's-charge
onto a friendly castle square.  If your piece ends its move in a
friendly castle square, then it must vacate that square next move
(via jump or knight's-charge if possible); this takes precedence over
the general must-capture-something-if-possible requirement.

Pieces in an opposing castle square cannot leave it, except to move
to the other opposing castle square (a "castle move").  Each player
is limited to two castle moves per game.
