I just received the game Mankahla (aka; kahla or oware or The African 
Stone Game) as a christmas present.  Unfortunately, the game came with
very incomplete instructions.  Is anybody familiar enough with the
game to answer some questions?

There are (according to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Mancala Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, the definitive study of the
subject, by Laurence Russ) over 100 different major Mancala games (not
counting the minor variations from town to town mentioned by the other
person to respond). As such, it's difficult to explain "the" mancala.

However, a few books do have rules for Mancala games. Some versions of
Hoyle's Rules to Games have a mancala, so check your library. Dover Books
has recently reprinted Sid Sackson's brilliant "A Gamut of Games", which
includes a Mancala variant entitled "Cups". Sackson's "The Klutz Book of
Classic Board Games" contains a mancala game, as does "Favorite Board
Games You Can Make And Play", a Dover book whose author escapes me at the
moment. Finally, Wayne Schmittberger's "New Rules for Classic Boardgames",
published by Wiley, contains a mancala variant called "The Glass Bead
Game". 

Someone over on rec.games.abstract claimed recently that mancala had been
"solved" (that is, proven to be a win for one player with correct play). I
don't remember which player, and I don't know which rules, although I
suspect that, like Nine-Men's-Morris, the solution is neither obvious nor
boring, so that even between good players the game remains interesting.

Schmittberger's "Glass Bead Game" is much more complex than mancala, as is
(I suspect) "Cups", so you might check those out if mancala begins to tire.
