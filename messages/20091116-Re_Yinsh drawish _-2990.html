Nope.

I had one draw a while ago at vying (I was white):
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://vying.org/game/160748">http://vying.org/game/160748</a>

However, I didn't know of the draw rule back then; otherwise,
the game might've ended differently. Other than that one
game, I haven't had any draws in about 60 games, but it's
been close a couple of times -- this one, for example:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://vying.org/game/170172">http://vying.org/game/170172</a>

After move 81, the score was 1-1 with two markers left.

Does anyone know (or want to speculate on) the motivation
for limiting the number of markers? It seems very arbitrary
and pointless to me. Several times it has terminated what
would've been a really interesting endgame. :(

There have been a few other draws at vying, but none with
the top players. And the level of YINSH players there isn't
too good, anyway.

There's still plenty of action in the game you linked to.

I agree.

When I first played YINSH, I thought it's boring. But after
sticking to it for a while, I've learned to understand and
appreciate it and it's now one of my favourites.
