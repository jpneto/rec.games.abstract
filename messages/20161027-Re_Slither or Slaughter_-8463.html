I 90% agree. Slither was the Chess of the abstract game "renaissance" ( starting around the 2010 mark). Other games were overlooked while the hype just kept accumulating. I was over it after a year myself. Its not nearly as remarkable as everyone says. Still a great game but Yodd and Hex Oust and various other titles should probably recieve more attention. The "games" of Hazen Abouricha should continue to be widely ignored.

As long as you do not understand that Slither is a crappy game since its inception you will never ever produce a good game. NEVER!!!
If I wish I could explain why some game is a crappy one.
But you are too dumb to understand it.
Stop talking about games during one year.
Solve this question : what is a good game? what is the "profile" of good game? 
Once you define precisely what is a good game then (maybe) you will produce a decent game.
You will find few articles about what is a good game but all are biased (replayability, addictive and so on) or insufficient.
Do not analyze the psychology of the average player that is the wrong path.
There are only few characteristics of what is a good game.
If you find them or the method on how to find them then you will not need the thumbing ups of bgg to "become fictiously" a good game designer.
