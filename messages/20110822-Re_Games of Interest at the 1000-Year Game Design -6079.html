I'm curious Mark: why Flume, and not, say, Oust?

Both Oust and Flume will certainly thrive 1000 years from now.  But
the Flume rule set is easier and its gameplay more accessible.  You
have to play Oust 100 times before the counterintuitive tactics take
hold. 

I like the millennium theme.  It takes time for a body of strategic
knowledge to grow.  Oust is the greatest game in the world, but the
world doesn't know it yet.  The world still thinks it's Go, lol

Hmmm. So, I feel that if you're trying to win the contest, as opposed
to just submitting your best game, Oust may <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>still<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be the better
choice.

My reasoning: Flume is like other dots-n-boxes games in that the
opening is obscure to newbies. The vast majority of people don't see
the depth in these kinds of games are because the openings are so hard
to comprehend.

The contest administrators aren't going to be able play any of the
entries in depth enough to get past opening bafflement. In other
words, the games which give a good first impression will win even if
they're not the most worthy of victory.  Ergo, Flume is maybe not the
most strategic choice. Rebuttal?
