Looking back, I believe I was unnecessarily harsh on various fellow designers, especially Christian Freeling, Corey Clark, and Luis Bolanos Mures.

So what was your first clue?

Now I'm about done with designing abstract games, though I'm still observing the progress of my existing games and new developments of others, and I want to make amends.  Christian is the most famous organic game designer in the world and deserves the most respect, I believe.
Don't overdo it. And you may be done with abstract games, but the reverse may not be the case. There's this secret hiding in full view, yet understood by few: abstract games have a mind of their own.
