You don't need to be an athlete to watch a game of football, but you
do need to be intelligent to understand a game of Chess. That is where
the limit to the popularity of Chess comes from, and a change to the
rules to fix that would only destroy Chess! (Smess, anyone?)

This argument gets repeated enough that it's worth refuting.
First, following high level chess is not even popular among
those who play chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

People certainly do play a lot of Checkers and Monopoly at home
without elevating competitive play of either of those games to
anything above insignificance.

Public interest in playing Chess will sell chess sets - and increase
the pool of chess talent. Public interest in competitive Chess will
increase the prizes paid to the winners of competitions. That interest
will presumably increase if more people play Chess.

More to the point, the fact that the following of high level Chess is
weak is what is perceived as the problem.

Second, games that are even harder
to understand than chess, e.g. Go, manage to get more of
a following than chess does.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There were times and places where Chess had a much larger following
than it does today, proportionately.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I have never seen anyone provide a single bit of data in
support of the theory that chess' popularity is near some
inherent limit. Holding that belief, given that high level
chess has a number of obvious defects, is nothing more
than a mindless defense of the status quo.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

High level Chess today indeed has serious problems, many of which
result from fighting over a share of a much smaller pie.

If FIDE hadn't been hauled off to Turkmenistan, if all was sweetness
and light in the USCF, however, I doubt that it would really make much
difference to decisions of individuals at home to play Chess rather
than, oh, say, Mortal Kombat II or whatever.

It is an obvious reality that today competing distractions abound in a
way they did not in past eras when Chess was much more popular. Since
Chess <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>was<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> more popular, it's not a question of an "inherent limit",
but it is obvious that Chess is more intellectually demanding, and
less immediately gratifying, than some other competing amusements.

One reads articles, recently, noting that people in the Western world
are not getting as much sleep as they used to. Urban expansion, plus
certain changes to the housing market, plus conditions in the labor
market, mean people have to spend longer driving or riding to work.
This could well incline working people towards different types of
amusement. But thoroughgoing social reform is something one would
pursue for its own sake; it is out of the scope of an effort to
promote Chess specifically.
