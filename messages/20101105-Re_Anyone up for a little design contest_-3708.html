Not to restrict it to death but one might impose that the two players, Black

occasionally remove groups of orthogonally adjacent, like-colored stones,
completing a turn begun with a stone placement.

"one" or you? I think everyone is reading this and saying "fuck off"

Filling a small, odd size board (like the 5x5 in Cepahlopod - see below) and
tallying the score is a good objective.  Filling a 19x19 board and tallying
the score could be cumbersome.  A game of annihilation is so much better for
a large board.  It's pretty clear who won.  You don't have to suffer through
the anticlimax of "Well we're done playing, but now we have to sit here
counting stones like idiots."

Well I dunno about that, anyone who is too lazy to face the
"anticlimax" of tallying up their territory in a territory game is
probably too lazy to even care who Mark Steere is.

Whew, that's a lot of restrictions.  At the end of it, we're left with

The stone limit rule is an aesthetic Hiroshima.

Cephalopod played on a 25 square board can easily take upward of 140 moves.
140/25 = 5.6, a massive recycling factor, made possible with the added
dimension of dice.

yes the added spatial dimension of depth generally does make things
bigger....


Okay another stupid ass post by Mark, deconstructed and roundly
criticized. We'll have to do it again sometime.
