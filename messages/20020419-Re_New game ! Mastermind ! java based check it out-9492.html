I'm a big fan of the game of Mastermind.  At one time I owned more
than 75 (!) different computer implementations of it.  (All for the
PC.)  Mastermind has got to be the most popular programs/games young
programmers like to write.  Everyone who begins programming seems to
want to write their own version.

The problem with this is that most of these programs are horrible. 
Because the young programmer is just starting out, their program lacks
the finer touches, options, and enhancements to truly make it nice. 
But after getting their program to work, at this point the programmer
often has no wish to work on it any further... they're already
interested in programming something else.  I've seen more than 75
different Mastermind programs and probably 99% of these were "version
1.0".  In fact, I can't ever remember ever seeing a "version 2.0."

I looked at your program.  It's a good start but ideally, I should be
able to configure it to play Super Mastermind (5 hole, 8 colors) if I
choose to.  I should also be able to choose LESS pegs and colors if I
want to play an easier game.  I should be able to make a guess without
having to place a peg in every hole.  (At times this is ideal if I'm
interested in specific feedback on certain pegs.)  I should be able to
play a match against the computer, and have it solve MY code.  The
program should save my scores and give me a percentage of how many
moves, on the average, it takes me to solve each code.  It should
allow the option for takebacks.  It should allow me to setup a
position, and then tell me how many codes are left with the moves I've
made in this position so far.  The program should allow me to change
the color of the pegs, the color of the board, etc., in case I don't
like the defaults.

There are dozens of other different enhancements and features to add. 
Above is just the tip of the iceberg.

Your program is a good start, (By the way, I correctly guessed its
code in five guesses... slightly higher than my average of 4 point
something) but your program is not anything different than what dozens
and dozens (shoot, hundreds or thousands, probably) of other
programmers have already done.

My philosphy on programming is to improve upon the programs, in some
way, however slight, that already exist.  If not, then what's the
point?

Let me know when you're up to version 5.0.  I'll take another look at
it then.
