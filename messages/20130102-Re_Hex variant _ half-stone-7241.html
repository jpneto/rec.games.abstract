More exactly, both Tripen and Trivor take a tessellation which is already trivalent (and hence a game by itself) and keep it trivalent through variable orientation cell division. The same operation can be done with any arbitrary trivalent grid made of symmetrical cells, and I'll gladly let you do that, since it was your idea.

My idea, instead, is using variable orientation cell division to make a trivalent game out of a non-trivalent grid, which is harder to put into practice.

I think it's fair to say that you'd be running off with my idea if you released Trisq 2.0 or any other game with variable orientation cell division on a non-trivalent tessellation, and that I'd be running off with yours if I released Tripen or any other game with variable orientation cell division on a trivalent tessellation. However, I think neither of us is running off with Hazen's idea, which was far too general.
