I never said I wanted extreme simplicity, but nor is the game very
complex, IMO.  Certainly no more so than Checkers.

Then add an uninspired
mechanism whereby neither player has incentive to stack onto the
other, only to be carried backward.  I don't know what happens in this
variant.  I guess each player stacks his own checkers together and
tries to hussle them off the board as quickly as possible, with
uniformly but oppositely colored stacks flowing past one another,
unimpeded.  Either that or the two armies meet at an impasse in the
middle and start jogging in place.  Either way it isn't pretty.

That's a very big assumption.  I very much doubt that the game will play
as you say.

Let's assume that this variant is even a game, which is a huge
assumption for me at this point.

What are your criteria for something being a game, since Stackers
apparently doesn't meet them?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Just because you can't see how there'd be a draw doesn't mean
experienced players won't figure it out.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed not.  And I did say that draws are possible if players cooperate
to get there, but I can't see any one player forcing a draw, which is
the main problem with infinite draws: If a player that has no hope of
winning can force infinite play, that is a problem, but I can't see
infinite play without both players copperating.  I may be wrong, so if
you can prove otherwise, I will happily admit I was wrong.

Why even take a chance like that?  It's like I want to sell you
a car with no spare tire because you're unlikely to get a flat.  What
if it turns out you get a flat every time you drive because the tires
are shitty?  It would be asinine in any other field but here it's ok.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Many good games have possibilities of draws: Chess and Go are just a few
examples.  Chess and Go have artificial rules to avoid infinite play,
and it would be easy to add a similar rule to Stackers if it is found to
be needed.  I would not do so unless infinite play turns out to be a
problem, though.

In fact, you can argue that the possibility of draws is an advantage for
deterministic games, as absense of draws implies that one player has an
advantage.  Granted, presence of draws do not guarantee fairness, but it
is a requirement.

I actually share some of the blame for this discussion.  My mention of
Basic's game tree was just supposed to be an aside, an "oh, by the
way" type of thing.  What I was trying to put across was how simple
Basic is, but one look at the rules and you can see that anyway.  If
I'd only not mentioned the game tree...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Stackers was not primarily an attempt to increase the game tree.  I
admit that the idea for Stackers grew out of this discussion, but the
main purpose was to make an interesting and fairly original game, the
original part being the rule for moving parts of stacks that are capped
on both ends by the moving colour.
