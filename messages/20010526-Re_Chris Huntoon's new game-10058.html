Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Labeling Gorgon as
a Checkers variant and then in turn insisting that it retain all the key
elements of Checkers is a misjudgment.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Perhaps you need to re-read my post. I didn't say that Gorgon should have
compulsory capture (henceforth cc) because it is a Checkers variant. I
said many techniques are not possible without cc which would be a shame.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Consequently, the usual
considerations of "top", "bottom" and "middle" become subjective rather than
fixed and indeed tend to get lost altogether as play progresses.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

To my experience usually only one or two pieces break through the
opponent lines and return to your side of the board. This, however, is so
important for winning the game, that such a piece has a actually
been "promoted" (in a very subtle manner).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think you
agree that the absence of promotions enhances the game rather than make it feel
like "castrated" Checkers.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think no formal promotions are necessary.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Lets look at Gorgon played with forced captures.  The same basic scenario would
keep coming up: the pieces would invariably clash in the middle and a "wall" of
stones would form.  This in turn would create a delineated top, middle and
bottom.  Worst of all the overall range of choices open to the players would
quickly become limited.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can force your opponent to provide you with some more space to move by
forcing him to jump. A wall is formed in both variants, but this wall isn't
complete for a long time. In the non-cc variant this wall consists more of
non-petrified pieces, but they mostly cannot move as the game progresses.
I never played a game of cc-Gorgon in which not at least one piece managed
to break through.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
When playtesting Gorgon with and without compulsory jumps there really was no
clear winner between the two methods.  I personally feel that forced jumps
should be left out of the game for the reasons I gave above.  Although having
compulsory jumps would certainly be an acceptable "variant."  After all, each
approach has its own unique strategic possibilities (not necessarily "better"
but definitely different.)  :-)

As diplomats would say: "We can agree to disagree." :-)
Thank you.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I've always had a poor time writing about myself.  But I'll see what I can do.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Thank you.

BTW if you want we could play two games of Gorgon simultaneously (would
take months though), one game with cc, one without, just write to my
e-mail account, if you are interested in a "mixed" match.

Ralf
