What I did say is that as long as the randomness does not favor any player the game could be fair only if the rules and this architecture are fair.

The unfairness of the games is linked to the architecture and the rules of the games. 

What makes me worry about your game is that the first player who win the 6-set has high probability to win the game. Did you test that hypothesis?

How many times out of 100 games the first player who wins first the 6-set won the game?

If it is above 50% then there is a flaw to correct.

Starting from winning the 1-set then the 2-set then the 3-set and son on will make the game more strategic if you make the fighting for each set level harder. You will suppress the direct win 666-333 (it is all luck!). Knock out at the start of the game.

Anyway thanks for your game. I hope that more playing tests will not reveal some flaw.

You need at least 10.000 games tested to have a clear idea.

100`s are not sufficient in my point of view.

Computing the probabilities seems necessary (in the worse case 6^24 possibilities). It is manageable.

I did some simulations.

Thank you for the feedback, Hazen.  Certainly the first player to obtain a 6-6-6 is more likely to win.  Even the 5-5-5.  Or a 6-6-5-5.  As in all games, once you've attained an advantage of some sort, you're more likely to win.  What matters is that Player 1 is not more likely to get the first 6-6-6 just because he's the first to roll.  The reason is that Player 1 makes a half roll of 6 dice on his first turn, and Player 2 makes a full roll of 12 dice on his first turn.  And then both players make full rolls of 12 dice on every turn thereafter.

Yes, there's more work to do here.  Again, thank you for the feedback.  And thank you for inspiring me in the first place :)
