So, what would draws in an ideal game be like?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The above remarks suggest it might be similar to Go-like games,
that is, games where there is more than just a win/loss outcome,
but a range of "scored" outcomes.  There aren't many of these,
but there are some.  Games like "Amazons", where at game end
the loser has run out of legal moves, but the winner still
has some (again, say, anything from one to twenty) left over.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If we're looking for a "points" game where the spread is typically
huge (and therefore draws minimized), there is one that I play often
that fits the criterion well.  The rules:

1.  board=hexhex
2.  two colors of stones.  let's call them red and blue.
3.  on each turn, player fills a cell with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> available color
4.  game ends when board is full
5.  player 1 wins if the product of the sizes of the two largest red
groups is larger than than the same product for blue groups.  If there
is only one group for a color, the final score for that color is
zero.

Because the final score is a product the scores can and do swing
wildly.  I've seen (and participated in) spreads greater than 2000
points.  One of the greatest game experiences of my life came while
playing this game, when the difference in final scores ended up being
2, something I've not come close to achieving before or since.  The
game obviously works better played online, where the computer tallies
the score for you.

You can step through the moves in a recently completed game here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=17&amp;sid=48567&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en">http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=17&amp;sid=48567&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en</a>

(note in the version that you see there, there are no ties, because
player 1 wins in the event of an equal score.  But if you change it a
bit so that equal scores are defined as a tie, the game is a good
example of what we're looking for).  There's more than one drawn state
in that game, though, so it's not really what I'm looking for.

I suppose it requires that nobody but perfect players
even be able to imagine a drawn state.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh no, not at all!  It could be very easy for anyone with basic
game knowledge to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>check<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that a certain position satisfies
the (maybe even unique) drawing conditions in the rules; but still
hugely difficult to actually achieve it.  Indeed there are hints
of NP-not-equal-P-ness to this.  (Don't read that aloud to fast!)

Hard to find but easy to verify.  That's essentially P =/= NP.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

ahh yes.  That is a helpful analogy.  Gives me a new way to think
about it.

I've noticed that you sprinkle your posts with design challenges.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, I'm glad you think so, because it's a laudable goal.
But I'm surprised you think so, because I can't think of
any particular design challenges I've sent out here!
Please recall and tell us of some, it sounds fun.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

One that I remember offhand:  a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>local<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> YMMV pattern.  I've given that
one some serious thought, without much progress.  I don't have time at
the moment to go search through the archives for others, but I'm
pretty sure there are others.

It might be a cool idea to compile a list of such challenges
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well great!  But I don't recall any.  Can YOU start a list for us?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes!  Maybe not at this very moment, but certainly in the next week or
so.  So now off the top of my head, we have: 1) a local YMMV pattern;
2) a game with a single drawn state that only perfect players can
reach; and 3) the "analogue" connection game that you guys are
discussing in the other thread (about which I have fruitlessly
wondered on many occasions).

THIS is the place!  It has been a great place up till recently,
but now the waters have become poisoned, as happens all too
often on Usenet, alas.   Pity.

This is not the first forum that's gone wanky as a result of a-certain-
someone's presence.  Nor is it the second.  There are vivid,
entertaining accounts of past difficulties across the web, if you want
a chuckle.
