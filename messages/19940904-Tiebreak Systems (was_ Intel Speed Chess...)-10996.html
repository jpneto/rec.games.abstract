 &gt;Intel Speed Chess Grand Prix. LONDON.
 &gt;[...]
 
 &gt;The speed playoff games were both drawn. [6 mins to white, 5 to black,
 &gt;draw odds.] Anand and Nikolic qualify.
 &gt;[...]
 
 &gt;The playoff was Kramnik 1/2 Ivanchuk so Ivanchuk qualifies
 &gt;because Black had draw odds (in return for a time disadvantage
 &gt;of White 6 mins - Black 5 mins.)
 &gt;[...]
 
 &gt;FINAL 
 
 &gt;7pm	Anand			- Ivanchuk
 
 &gt;The final was conducted in the following manner.
 &gt;A two game series of 25 mins per side games. When
 &gt;this was tied, there was a two game series of 
 &gt;5 minute per side games. When this was tied there
 &gt;was a 6 minutes to white and 5 minutes to black game
 &gt;where black got draw odds for tie-breaking purposes.

 &gt;[Ivanchuk wins the tiebreak and the title]

Does anyone else think this tiebreak system is really dumb?

Giving draw odds in exchange for 6-5 time odds must be an <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>enormous<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
advantage for Black, especially at that level of competition.  Black can
play a very safe, dull style, and White will be forced to take all the
risks.  In fact, the advantage may be so large that it affects the way
the previous games are played as well.  I would be very surprised if
Ivanchuk wasn't fully aware of his "Ace in the hole" during the final
and semi-final matches. [nb: He actually was not, because the colour
was determined by coin-flip before the game. -drb]

Not only is the tie-break unfair, but it also encourages boring "play
for the draw" chess.  The games may still be decisive, because of the
clock, but the moves played may be less exciting than would otherwise
be the case.  The fact that White is forced to take chances in the last
game doesn't qualify as exciting chess either, in my opinion, because
those risks may be contrived or even downright stupid (but forced).

So what are the alternatives?  Here is a suggestion: assign different
tiebreak values to the different kinds of draws.  This may apply to just
the final speed game, or could be applied to all draws occurring during
the match.  Here are some ideas for assigning tiebreak values:

Stalemate:  1.00 for the player forcing the stalemate
  (0.00 for the player who cannot make a legal move)

Perpetual Check:  0.70 for the checking player (0.30 to the defender)

Three-fold Repetition:  0.55 for the player initiating the
  sequence (0.45 for the player who accepts the repetition)

Draw by the Fifty Move rule:  0.50 for each player, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>or<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> 0.51 for
  Black (draw odds) if a decisive result is absolutely essential

Draw by agreement:  0.50 for each player, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>or<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> allow the two
  players to negotiate an agreement from 0.00 to 1.00 for each
  (must add to 1.00 and not to be divided beyond hundredths)

This last idea is an interesting option for regular chess tournaments.
Instead of just offering a draw, the offering player also specifies a
tiebreak value for the game.  For example, the player defending the weak
side might say "I offer a draw and will give you 0.60 of the tiebreak
point", and then hit his clock.  The opponent might reply "I will accept
for 67% of the tiebreak" (or the rule might be that she either accepts
the offer, or makes a move and then offers a new deal).

So far, these tiebreak values do not affect the main result of a draw,
which is still one half of a point for each player.  Ultimately, it
might be interesting to use these values as the actual result of the
game.  It could help avoid the necessity of tiebreaks to decide
tournament prizes, and would add a healthy new element to the game.
