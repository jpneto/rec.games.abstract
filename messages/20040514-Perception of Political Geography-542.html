Seeing a Coloradoan's view of Queens, NY reminded me of the funny perception
so many people have of how California is (or is about to be) the most
populated part of the country.

Let's compare California with a contiguous region that's smaller than
California. That region consists of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the
District of Columbia.

  Sq. Mi.  Population  P/SqM  Region
163,710  33,871,648  206.9  California
139,224  57,126,987  410.3  Megalopolis

I used the term "Megalopolis", but usually when people use that term,
they're not thinking of upstate NY or most of Pennsylvania. The states of
the megalopolis have 85% of California's area, 169% of its population, and
are 198% as dense.

None of this should come as a surprise. If you want to find the largest
concentrations of people, you generally have to go to the most abundant
sources of fresh water. It's amazing that Southern California has become as
dense as it has.

Rather than working hard to create a Constitution for Iraq, why don't we
just give them ours?  We're not using it.
