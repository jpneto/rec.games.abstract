Hello

I would applaud such a rules change (10x10) Othello. It is a problem
with many game inventors as well game publishers that they invent/publish
games which have (or will have) some day not more than a few middle game
moves left, e.g. Zertz or Invers (both by Kris Burm) ans so die of
exhaustion.

However, with 10x10 Othello this seems not to be true (as reported by
the top players in the 10x10 events that I've organised at the last two
Mind Sports Olympiads).  I have been pushing 10x10 Othello partly for
reasons of opening theory exhaustion of 8x8, but even more because I'm
not at all sure you're right that one must increase the board size a
lot before computers start to have problems.  The problem with 8x8 is
that the midgame has shrunk to about 5 moves: the top programs can now
play perfectly from at least 24 empty.  They could probably do so in
10x10 too, but with so much less opening theory (maybe out to move 12
in the foreseeable future as against 25 in 8x8 now) that means the
midgame is over 60 moves.

I do not care what computer programs can do. There are robots who jump
higher than every human person, and yet I like athletics. The
memory of my computer is far larger than that of my brain, and yet I'm
glad that I can memorize at all. Humans should never be compared to
machines or computers. To do so is disdaining humans.
