I don't know; up to now I have not played any of his games. The reality is that nowadays there are more people that want to be abstract game designers than there are players.

I don't understand why the theoretical questions are "unuseful". They are for sure useful to the people who participate. If you are not interested in them, simply don't participate in the thread. 
In the meantime you can start new threads on topics that you find "useful". How can you force other people to only discuss what you find interesting ?

The BGG forum is a moderated one, but there is no "ideology police". As long as you behave in a respectful way, nobody will ban you even if your positions are highly controversial.
Actually the moderators in BGG are not members of the abstract games community, so they will care very little about your controversial ideas on game design or originality. 
They only check if you adhere to the charter: no personal insults, no foul language, etc.

Mister megamau,

I`m not disrespectful toward anyone but toward dumb and ignorant guys who are trying to look smart and erudite.
I participate to an average of 20 forums (different fields and interests) in mainly two languages (english and french).
I`m not native english spoken. So my english is not as higher as I wish. My native language is french.
Here is how the forum works.
There are unsaid rules : 
- a newbie whatever what he say wrong or right is always a newbie. And sadly the moderators will always defend an " old member" against a newbie even if the old member is is blatantly wrong.
- in each forum you have a collective behaviour stopping anyone who is trying to change the forum. Collective behaviour treating this guy as troll almost like a terrorist. A freedom fighters are often treated as terrorist (Mandela Arafat and others were treated as terrorists). Silent him!!!! that is the slogan of the what I call the maffia.
- an old member can insult any newbie without fearing any punishment. In the contrary some moderators take the side of the old member.
- no charter define what is an insult. If someone is dumb or ignorant and you treat it as he or she is it is not an insult even in courts! 
- there is a collusion of interests mostly commercial one`s between the administration and some members (publishers and so on). You come with a free method or even a free game in some forums you will be harassed and provoked until you flee. Why? because they are selling methods or games.
I can give you a more longer list of the unsaid rules.
What you call conspiracy is just just how the maffia deny you the right to criticize.
There is a conspiracy against an idea exposing maffia lies.

If you can not understand that there are theoretical questions unuseful for the game design then you do not know what is the game design.
There are theoretical questions directly linked to the game design : what capturing mechanisms implies in terms of gameplay? has anyone debated such problem? noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what are the effects of non capturing mechanisms on the gameplay? and so on.
When you see people talking a lot about theoretical questions unrelated to the game design you quickly understand that those guys have nothing to say about the game design!
