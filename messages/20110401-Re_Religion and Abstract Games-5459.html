A true atheist never wavers.  He never has wavered and never will.  No
matter what!  It's been said there are no atheists in foxholes.  I've never
been in a foxhole, but if I were in a foxhole, there would certainly be an
atheist in a foxhole.

My resolve can't grow any stronger.  It's already absolute.  Every imbecilic
hillbilly who introduces himself by bombarding me with canned rhetoric that
he hardly believes himself only bolsters my resolve.

The so-called "religion of peace", which I dare not mention by name out of
fear for my life, dangerous though it is, is vastly more respectful than
Christianity.  Nobody's jumping up in your face screaming "['religion of
peace' deity] loves you!  Believe it or burn!"  Yes, they mow people down
with machine guns, but that's almost preferable.
