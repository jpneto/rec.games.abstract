Somehow I think "The Annoying Devil" (try youtube) inspired me.
There's this clip where he collects turds to arrange them neatly on a
much frequented footbridge, early in the morning, before people go to
work. Hilarious!
But I didn't move the dispute. I posted Monkey Trap at LG without its
genesis. But Thnikkaman asked the why and how, so I gave the why and
how.
Now the point: Nobody cares.
There has been no single reference to its genesis, only posts about
the game itself.

That would be a good idea! Only problem may be to' just make a game',
but I'd be surprised if you hadn't anything lying on the shelf. You
could even make it an entry for the contest: Freeling Loses His Shit
wins contest! ;-)
