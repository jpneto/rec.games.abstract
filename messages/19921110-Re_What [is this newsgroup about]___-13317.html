Hmm, a request for the FAQ already....  Does anyone have a copy of the
charter handy?  No?  I'll try to go off from memory, so this is worth
the paper it's printed on... and I'm using a terminal.

Rec.games.abstract is for games of pure strategy which have no existing
newsgroup.  Pure strategy implies no hidden knowledge and no element of
chance.  Thus, by way of example, Othello and Pente are two that satisfy
both criteria.  Chess and Go do as well, but they have existing groups.

Btw, I speak only for myself, and if I'm in error, don't say I didn't 
warn you...

The geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury.  Due north of the
center we find the South End.  This is not to be confused with South
Boston which lies directly east from the South End.  North of the South
End is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End.
