|&gt; This game goes like this:
|&gt; 
|&gt; ***
|&gt; *****
|&gt; *******
|&gt; 
|&gt; There are 15 stones total in three rows. You and your opponent take some
|&gt; stones in turn. The stones you can take each time must be adjacent and
|&gt; in the same row or column, e.g.
|&gt; 
...
|&gt; 
|&gt; You can take as many stones as you can in one turn.
|&gt; 
|&gt; The person who take the last stone wins/loses. 
|&gt; 
|&gt; What is a good strategy?
|&gt; 

This game is called Nim and very old. It's a first player win for every
number of rows and stones per row. A perfect strategy was first published
1901 by an Harvard mathematician, Charles L. Bouton, and later on by
Martin Gardner in the Scientific American. 
You write down the numbers of stones per row in binary. Then you count
the 1's per column. Are these numbers even, you have an winning position
and else a loosing one. A winning combination is transformed to a loosing
one whatever the opponent takes. 
Example:
 *                    0 1     is an winning position.
 * * *                1 1 
 * *                  1 0
