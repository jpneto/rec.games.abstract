You just wrote:

:Maybe, you can play with a third set of marbles that are split between 
: the two players.  Either player can use them to push, but they don't count
: toward a win if they're pushed off.  That would make the board a bit
: tighter like with three players.  I've noticed three player games are
: much more agressive.

But then if I move a neutral marble to a position that would help me, my 
opponent could simply move it back to where it was prior to my move.  
Yeah, you could make a rule preventing "tag-backs" like that.  

I still think there's an easier way to keep the game moving.  Simply play 
agressivly.  If you are forcing your opponent to move, the game doesn't 
end in a stalemate, or just run out of time.  If you have to, make a move
that provokes the other player to push you, even if it isn't a move that 
will help you.  It will help you in the end, when they are actually 
moving their marbles around.  It's at least a game then.
