There was an earlier arcade game, called Snake (I think), that was one of
the earliest CRT_screen games around. I ran into it in the Winter of
1977-78. It consisted of 4 players (up to 3 of which could be run by the
computer) each of which was a snake that (unlike later games called snake)
always left its whole tail in place. The motorcycle screen in the later TRON
was similar, except that in TRON (if I remember right) once a player was
eliminated, it's snake disappeared. In the original game, even dead snakes
were obstacles. Also, in the original game, the screen was not huge compared
to the width of the snakes, maybe 60x40 or something like that.
