Since Graham appears to be new here, time for a little putdown.

How you spend your time is your business.  I admit, I got caught up in the Redstone enthusiasm at LifeIn19x19 - probably a mistake on my part.  In fact, your involvement in Redstone, Graham, won't matter a heck of a lot in the long run.  If Redstone is a good game, there will be other Grahams.

If redstone is a good game, it will be accidentally reinvented some 20
years after Mark Steere is dead from apoplexy. Probably it will stay
an interesting curiosity that time around too.

Because you can be very charming when you think you can gain something
from it, like most sociopaths. You have mostly - but not entirely -
been able to hold back on your feces-throwing antics when implementors
have refused your advances.

You've said the same thing of games you have long lost interest in,
like Tanbo. (Hell, you probably said it about Quadrature). That
particular game which was vastly superior to Go, wasn't even able to
hold it's daddy's attention. Do you think repeating it enough times
will make it come true, Mark?

In the extremely unlikely case that a game with the Oust rules is
played in 200 years, some digital archaeologist is probably going to
dig up these posts, be amazed, and say: "Look, this guy had the basic
idea for our favorite game before anyone else! Pity he was such a
collossal asshole, otherwise we could have played it long before its
reinvention in 2150!"

This community does not remotely thrive, Graham. And it isn't even all
Mark Steere's fault (though it is for a large part). Christian and
Mark were only fans of each other as long as they felt they mutually
benefited from the ego-boo, and recently the community has gone
overboard with plagiarism accusations against Nestor Romeral Andres -
one of the few people from this community who has gone on to create
something of lasting value, namely a print-on-demand publishing model
for small abstracts.

Do not waste keystrokes on loons like Steere. Forget you ever heard
about Redstone (outside a Minecraft context!). If you're interested in
games besides Go, how about a nice game of Hex? Already independently
invented twice (in 1942 by Piet Hein and 1949 by John Nash) so too
basic for any one asshole to preen his ego over.
