there's been a few article here about various Nomics out there.  as
the current Speaker of Agora Nomic, i thought i'd make a few comments
(although not officially, as that would be our Ambassador's duty).

Agora is perhaps the busiest of all Nomics; in the last six weeks
nearly 100 proposals have been proposed.  over the life of Agora there
have been approximately 1000 proposals.

we currently have 24 Players (i believe), and well over one hundred
Rules.  i won't post the Ruleset because it's 110K long.  people
interested in a copy can mail our Rulekeepor, Chuck Carroll
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:ccarroll@student.wisc.edu">&lt;ccarroll@student.wisc.edu&gt;</a>, and request a copy.

we are also the only Nomic i know of that has an associated refereed
journal, the Journal of Agora Nomic.  Chuck Carroll (address above) is
the editor-in-chief.  mail him for more information.

Agora is open to anyone who wishes to play.  there are two mailing
lists, "nomic-official", for the official pronouncements of Officers
and the Speaker, and "nomic-discussion", for everything else.
subscription to these lists is open: mail <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:majordomo@teleport.com">"majordomo@teleport.com"</a>
with the command "subscribe &lt;listname&gt;" in the body to subscribe to
either of these lists.

Prospective players may register to play by mailing our Registrar,
David Cogen <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:cogen@ll.mit.edu">&lt;cogen@ll.mit.edu&gt;</a>.  however, it is highly encouraged that
prospective players "lurk" for a while on the distribution lists to
get a feel for the game.  nomic-discussion can represent a great deal
of mail; there were 156 messages posted to nomic-discussion on
November 16th, for example.

Agora has an unofficial home page, maintained by its Archivist, Don
Blaheta <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:dblahedo@quincy.edu">&lt;dblahedo@quincy.edu&gt;</a>.  the URL is
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://shamino.quincy.edu/~blahedo/nomic.html">&lt;http://shamino.quincy.edu/~blahedo/nomic.html&gt;</a>.

further inquiries about Agora Nomic may be addressed to our
Ambassador, Chuck Carroll (address above) or to myself.
