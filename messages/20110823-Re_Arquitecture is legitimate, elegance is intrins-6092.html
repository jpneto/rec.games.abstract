This is not the case with rules aimed only at correcting
technical flaws in the game as a logical device: superko, for example,
prevents the logical aberration of cycles, but doesn't add to the
pleasure of finding the best move in a position (quite the opposite,
in fact). The challenge, in those cases, is finding a rule which
corrects the flaw as if unwittingly, because of its side effects on
game play being more noteworthy.

Its effects rather, ideally the flaw is corrected implicitly.

That's what Christian achieved with
Sygo; Goncrete is halfway there, which is already an improvement. If
one of those games can prove that their game play is just as good as
that of Go, the burden of superko will be enough to tip the balance.

Drawing from experience I doubt the latter. Players of traditional
games tend to be fiercely opposed to anything seriously worthy of
comparison. Draughts is a sad example.
When you say 'prove' I guess you mean by prolongued extensive play.
It's not so hard to see that some simple organic games will be
inexhaustable in human terms. Yodd among them.

Note that 'legitimate' is not the same as 'intrinsic', which I would
define as 'naturally arising from the character of the accompanying
rules'. Intrisic rules are almost transparent. They don't look like
rules in themselves, but rather simple consequences of other rules.
Superko can be more or less intrinsic, but it can't be legitimate.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Superko is a problem, not a rule, and a rule govening it is legitimate
(i.e. justifyable).

The castling move in chess is legitimate, but never intrinsic. A rule is
made legitimate when it has won credibility as a helpful means to
improve the game's tactics or strategy and hence the pleasure one can
expect from playing it. In an ideal game, every rule should be
legitimate, and most rules should be intrinsic.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ideally all rules should be intrinsic and implicitly legitimate.
That's what makes a game quintessential.

'Legitimate' would have to do with architecture, e.g. the architecture
of an acyclic game whose rules don't seem directed to prevent cycles.
'Intrinsic' would have to do with elegance, e.g. the elegance of a
game where you feel completely free in spite of the ever repressive
rules... but less repressive because they're intrinsic.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

All rules are restrictive. It's a fine line between a rule that shapes
by restriction and a rule that restricts by repression.
