: [request for Quarto! rules]

Quarto! is a copyrighted game, can someone give me more details of who produces
it please?

GAME
	Quarto!

BACKGROUND

	The game has won the award 'Best Toy of the Year in All Categories'
	at some toy-happening in Cannes, France.
	[more details anyone? -neilb]

RULES

	Quarto! is a two-player game, played on a board of four by four
	squares, and with sixteen pieces, all different. A piece has the
	following characteristics:

		- White or black
		- Big or small
		- Round or square
		- Whole, or with a hole in the top

	So, you have a small black square with a hole, a small black square
	that is whole, a big black square with a hole, etc, etc.

	One player begins, and he selects a piece. His opponent must place
	the piece on the board, and select a piece to give back, and so
	on.  The winner of the game is the player that completes a line of
	four.  A line of four consists of four pieces, that have (at least)
	one thing in common, be it that they are all black, or all big, or
	whatever.  A line of four can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

	So, a line of four can consist of:
		- A big white round with a hole
		- A big black square that is whole,
		- A big white square with a hole,
		- A big white round that is whole.
	Here all four pieces in the line are big.

	It's easy to learn, but not so easy to master.
