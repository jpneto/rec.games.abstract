Martin Grider never finished my Hex Oust app.  I think I've put $1000 dollars into that, but I don't remember exactly.  Haven't heard from Martin in over a year.  I don't blame him though.  The AI portion was just too fuckin' hard, as I tried to convey at the outset.  But sometime people just have to learn the hard way.

Sorry to say that in some sense Mark Steere is dumb or maybe ignorant.
With 1000 dollars as award there are many programmers who are ready to compete to build bots playing Hex Oust. A high percentage of them will do it for fun.
I can give you names if you want. 
5 of my games where programmed for free!!!! by people I have never met.
Choose a forum specialized in programming and launch your constest (1000 dollars prize) and you will see people coming from India, Pakistan, France, Canada, China, Morocco, and so on.
It will take to Mark less than 3 months to reach his goal.

Dumb?  Ok, I admit it.  Barely scraping through a semester and a half of law school has removed all doubt.

Arrogant?  Yep, that goes without saying.

I'll put $1000 into it, but I don't have time to organize a contest.

Seven years after I invented it, Codecup knows my name, but not my game. The pace of progress is dizzying...

You can write a mail to this guy Said Koudache 

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://hrx.free.fr/">http://hrx.free.fr/</a>

Ask him if he is interested to program it without talking about money.
He will surely agree to do it for free.
Ps : Keep in mind that I do not know him personaly.

You loose nothing by trying but post the rules (not an url or something like that).

Ok, I sent him an email.  I don't know where I would post the rules though.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Send him at least you website address
