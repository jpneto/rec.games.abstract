if it is possible, player B must move so that the

greatest common divisor or same absolute difference as the last two
consecutively-moved-on squares of Player A -- where player A is the
player who moves just before player B (and where who exactly are
players A and B changes each move -- player B always being the player
currently moving).

If there are no such adjacent squares that have the same GCD or
absolute difference, then player B may move to ANY orthogonally
adjacent square.

If a player is forced to move onto a square already occupied by
another player's marker, then the SECOND player to occupy the square
is removed from competition, and his/her marker is removed from the
grid. (A player landing on an already occupied square is a 'drat', as
in "Drat!".)


Play continues until there is one remaining player, who is then the
winner.

It seems fairly easy to force a draw: I expect there are often cases
where you by moving back and forth between two squares can force the
other player to move back and forth between two other squares.  But it
is probably possible to place the numbers in the first phase so this
can't happen.

It sounds intersting, though I have a feeling it will be a bit too
complicated for most players.

A game with similar feel might be to have on each square one of N
symbols that can be in one of N colours and one of N sizes.  With N=4,
you get 64 different combinations, so you can fill an 8x8 board with
one of each.

A move must preserve either shape, colour or size.  Additionally, if
the previous move preserved, say, colour, you must also preseve colour
(and similar for shape and size).  If the previous move preserved more
than one property, you must preserve as many as possible of those.
This includes that, if you can't preserve any of the previous moves
preserved property, you can make any move, as long as it preserves
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> property.

An 8x8 board may be too big for this, so you could have N=2 and
distribute two of each of the 8 combinations on a 4x4 board.

You could even build a board out of tiles that have these markings.

You could even use a Set deck: Take only the cards that have one
symbols (that's 27 cards: three shapes, three colours and three
shadings), shuffle them and lay 25 of them in a 5x5 grid.
Alternatively, place them in a staggered grid like this:


        +---+
        |   |
      +-+-+-+-+
      |   |   |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   |   |   |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   |   |   |   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   |   |   |   |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   |   |   |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   |   |
      +-+-+-+-+
        |   |
        +---+

so each card has (up to) six neighbours.
