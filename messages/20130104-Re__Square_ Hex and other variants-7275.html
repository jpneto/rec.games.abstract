I've played the square version. It's quite good. No problems with it. I have too many opinions on these sorts of games to cover them here. 

Try reading the books: 

Mudcrack Y and Poly Y (out of print since the 70's, but I'll give you my copy for $100 :) - It's an awesome book with many weird and wonderful connection game tesselations, including the square one. 

Also, the book Connection Games, by Cameron Browne. Besides Y and Hex, the book singles out Gonnect, Star, and Conhex, as being particularly excellent. Not necessarily the ones I would take with me to a desert island, but they're certainly excellent.

Hello,



I'm curious about a Hex variant called "Square" Hex (I didn't name it...), which is played on a board like this:

or equivalently this:

Has anyone here played it before?  What are your opinions of it?



Also, I'm interested in what people's opinions of other connection games are, compared to Hex.  Such as Y, Atoll, Begird, Lariat, etc.  Are there some you enjoy more than others?  If so, why do you think that is?
