easily wins 4x4 Othello (11-5) by taking a corner right away and then getting 
black to make a forced move; does anyone know 6x6 Othello?  These are all 
"evidence" (if not proof) that the second player has an advantage.

I'm not really sure that 4x4 or 6x6 Othello should be used to generalize to the
8x8 case.  6x6 Othello has been solved; it is a win for White, and I've
forgotten what the score is.  The techniques to winning in 4x4 and 6x6 Othello 
are rather straightforward and obvious, in comparison to 8x8 Othello.

White moves last, unless he loses parity.  IMHO, there is little Black can do
to cause White to give up parity willingly.

The 1992 Waterloo tournament was not the one I intended to refer to.  I 
meant the 1993 Waterloo Final tournament, where the top six programs from the
1993 Waterloo swiss were invited to play in a double round-robin.  In that
tournament, the top program (Logistello) got a score of 6.5 out of 10, and
the two bottom programs scored 4 out of 10.  White scored 25 wins and one 
draw out of 30 games.

Sacrificing corners is not necessarily a bad idea and, in some cases, makes
winning the game rather straightforward.  I've seen my program win handily 
after sacrificing a corner on move 17.
