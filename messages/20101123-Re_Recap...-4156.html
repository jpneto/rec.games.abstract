Self congratulations for the likes of Christmas Tree Y is actually rather typical of Bill Taylor.

Bill Taylor's plan to bring down rec.games.abstract was at first a simple one: Uninvite Freeling with trademark Taylor  snotiness.  "You're not worthy" - something Taylor now looks back on as constructive criticism, lol. The word "ugly" seldom plays a role in constructive criticism.

The problem was not Taylor's insults.  It was his gibberish.

Nobody even knew what the fuck Taylor was talking about.  And we still don't
because he refuses to answer any follow-up questions about his gibberish.

At first I thought Taylor's plan was succeeding, with Freeling running off
to join rgc rofl, but I should have known better.  It didn't take too much
Bill Taylor bullshit before Freeling came out swinging, with a flurry of
body blows, and a crushing knee to Taylor's groin.  Down for the count.

Phase 2: Taylor ups the ante.  He replaces deserter Korneliussen with new
recruit Corey Clark.  Clark is problematic because he's throwing Taylor
under the bus every ten minutes, but he'll have to do.

Nice summary, thanks.
For me, the problem is that I like to chat on a forum, but not in
order to get inspiration for a game.
When I mention how that happens, I'm usually met by disbelief.

I saw the workings of Symple as an organism by, again, reflecting on
the growth of bacteria in a peti dish, in the dark, while slipping off
to sleep. Except setting the 'group penalty parameter' to four,
instead of the initial two, nothing changed in the game. At least two
members who's judgment I value, like how it plays. Here's a game
between them:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/cgi-bin/Arena/Serve.cgi?file=Symple1289066467.html">http://mindsports.nl/cgi-bin/Arena/Serve.cgi?file=Symple1289066467.html</a>

Now for the 'criticism' part. This, Bill, is criticism:
I think Symple is less important than the mechanism that's named after
it: basically dilemma based on the choice between starting a new group
by placing a stone, and growing all existing groups.

Symple was just an implementation that happened before the mechanism
was discovered to be applicable in a range of themes that had some
affinity with territory. It is a nice game, but a little short on what
Mark J. Thompson in his leading article calls "drama":
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml">http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml</a>

To use a very low-res metaphor, I see Symple as a big ship slowly
heeling to one side. Once beyond its early (but hard to pinpoint)
tipping point, it's hard to tip the balance the other way.
I'm putting this rather black &amp; white: there are tactical issues to be
considered in Symple, but by and large it is a game for the thoughtful
and strategically inclined player. Not a great game, but a nice game
on the somewhat dubious Star theme, revealing it to be more like a
'territory theme of sorts' than a connection theme.

Seeing the wider applicability of the symple mechanism, followed
Nick's suggestion for a contest. I misunderstood your suggested theme
Bill, still don't understand it, for that matter, but I juggled the
symple mechanism against Hexade, and out came Lhexus. Totally
inconsequential, and the current base-10 implementation will be
trimmed back to base-8, because larger is just more of the same. We'll
implement a 'view configurations' option in the applet for triangles
and hexes (lines are spotted easily enough), to make the count easier
and forget about it.

Then I juggled the symple mechanism against Othello, and out came
Charybdis. This appears to be a good game, the 'wildness' of which is
nicely kept in check by capture being orthogonally only, and
restricted to growth (starting a new group may well enclose one or
more opponent's stones, custodian fashion, but they are not reversed)
and because of the negative feedback implied in capture: less groups
so less growing options next turn. This game is less 'tactical' than I
had initially anticipated, especially the square versions. There are
clearly 'calculable singposts' along the way.

The last game followed the symple mechanism's meeting with Go. Here I
had more than one reason to choose the capturing mechanism I also
employed in Lotus and Medusa. Sygo is designed "to be much faster than
Go, and finite, and without the ambiguities regarding life, death,
multiple ko's, four-bend-in-the-corner and the like, that make its
ancestor such a great game to argue about", as I state in the rules at
mindsports.
Sygo is what the whole wave was about in the first place, although
that could only be determined afterwards. It has all the markings of a
great game, and all the time in the world to prove it. The applet will
be online soon.

See Bill, arguing that some of my games are inconsequential, or lack
drama, or are 'nice enough', that doesn't sound like self
glorification, nor like an inability to accept criticism.
Unfortunately you've failed to critizise in any recognizable way. You
just paint an image of me that actually looks a lot more like you, and
then you ridicule it, thinking your imaginary supportive audience is
applauding.
No-one is applauding Bill,
