... as a practical matter, the moves on the squares of a 488 grid are
nearly, if not always, irrelevant. It isn't just that the squares are too
weak compared with the octagons -- in a game with alternating single moves

I don't believe that.  Without the squares, it's just Hex on a Go
board.  Games between skilled, equally matched players will always end
in a draw with a number of stymies, not just one.  Even if the squares
are valued less and played later, it won't be a game of Nim.  Which
squares are played first depends on the surrounding positions of those
squares.  To call them valueless doesn't make sense.

No.  The stymies will form and the connections won't belong to either
player until the stymies are sorted out.

So, for game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>players<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>,
there's no good reason not to use the FCFC rule, *even when playing on a 488

The FCFC represents an aesthetic problem for me.  It makes the
connections dependent upon the order in which the squares are
claimed.  I don't like that.

ZeN is a fully functional game, but I agree with your subjective dislike of
the Quax method of making the diagonal connections. Requiring a player to
play in two diagonally placed cells before allowing her to play in-between
seems arbitrary. I also don't like the Crossway rule that makes certain
cells verboten.

All these games are going to be a tad kludgy at best.  You're
shoehorning a stymie prone game into a non-stymie prone form.  Ouch.
I really never liked Quax though.  (Sorry Bill.  If I had to sugar
coat every comment on bad abstract games I'd be drowning in a mountain
of sugar.)
