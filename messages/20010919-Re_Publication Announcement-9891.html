The problem is, the original article completely understated the REAL 
benefits of go.

Go will:
1) Improve your sex life immeasurably.
2) Cure cancer.
3) Make you lots of money on the stock market.
4) Help you invent a better mousetrap.
5) End world hunger.

Obviously, then, everyone should learn go right away, preferably by 
buying my book!  In fact, you should buy several, as they are good luck 
charms.

If you argue with my entirely anecdotal evidence and demand scientific 
proof, then obviously your thinking is far too Western to ever understand 
go.  Shoo.

As wonderful as Go is, I find the sort of pseudoscientific claims presented on
behalf of the game's therapeutic value outrageous.  This sort of drivel turns up
again and again in discussions of strategy games.  On following them up -- I'm
interested in learning and intelligence in my 'day job' as a prof -- I
inevitably discover that none of these studies is based on randomized
experimental trials.  Mere clinical opinions do not count as proof.  

If anybody has any evidence from randomized trials, I'm all ears.

Cheers,

One astonishing result of this integration of brain function was
reported by William S. Cobb in his regular column "The Empty Board" in
the American Go Journal, Vol. 34, #3, Fall 2000, as follows:

"Last June (I visited) Japan to participate in a symposium on the
educational benefits of teaching Go in schools. .......  On this trip
I discovered that the Japanese have become seriously interested in the
possibilities of using Go as a therapy for people with mental
problems."

And Cobb goes on to say:

"In recent years, Dr. Kaneko Mitsuo, a Japanese neurosurgeon with an
international reputation, has been working with older people suffering

&gt;from senile dementia. Using PET scans he has shown that there is
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
substantial area of the right brain that begins to atrophy in people
who suffer from dementia. This turns out to be essentially the same
part of the brain that is most active when engaging in musical
activities and in playing Go. To research this further, Dr. Kaneko has
been teaching Go to patients in the beginning stages of dementia. (He)
is now convinced that learning to play Go can reverse the development
of dementia in virtually all patients in the beginning stages of the
disease. Of course, this does not apply to Alzheimer's, which is still
an incurable condition, but it does work for common dementia."

Augmenting these findings, an article I read a number of years earlier
described a medical study of professional Go players in Japan and
reported that they typically had a far lower incidence of Alzheimer's
Disease than non Go players! Perhaps even more amazing, according to
this same article these Go professionals were also found to have a
demonstrably faster and far more complete recovery from strokes than
"ordinary" citizens of otherwise comparable age and background! (Their
recovery of motor and cognitive function was comparable to that of
ambidextrous people, even though they were not!)
