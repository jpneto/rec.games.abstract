<div class="moz-text-flowed">I played two times at Kahuna (edited by Kosmos). It seems for me that 
you have to be a lucky guy to win and that it's hard to define a tactic...
<br>
<br>You have to avoid some mistakes (like having none connected islands) but 
seems to be hard to really have an impact of you opponent game.
<br>
<br>After playing, I count the cards... there are two cards per islands 
(even islands who have more bridges thant the others). Letting me think 
that it's really a matter of luck.
<br>
<br>I may be wrong (I read that it's a tactic game).
<br>
<br>Could someone who knows better than I this game, explain me if there are 
&nbsp;tactics for Kahuna ? and how to minimize the matter of random in the 
game. Many Thanks.

<br>sorry for my english, I'm french ;-)
