	You forgot to mention one small point: to "be valid" means "to 
be consistent with the previously posted fantasy rules."  By the way, does
anyone have the original (regular) ordinances?  Are we still using them or
have we accepted the revision?

	I hope we get some new players out of this.....

Well the issue of not having universal knowledge of what has been made yet
is tricky, I've tried to resolve it --- Before posting a rule I think the
formality of a statement of intent is still a good idea, so a new player
can get on the list and get the latest update, without having to pull out
our hair over internet-news propagation delays.
There are three more since the earlier post to this forum...  Hey, stranger!
if you want to be kept abreast of the fast-paced world of Fantasy Nomic, drop a
line to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET">DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET</a> and I'll slap you onto the list!
