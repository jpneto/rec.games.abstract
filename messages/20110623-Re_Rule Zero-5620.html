I think I largely agree with your "precidence" even though I'm not entirely
clear what you're talking about.  E.g., what do you mean by "Rule 0"?

Rule 0:

forces a draw (3 fold repetition) or repetition loses (by making the

Yep, these are the possibilities.

You're kind of losing me with this rule 0 / game law business.  Are these
suggested guidelines for players, programmers, designers, or what?

Balancing rules:  balancing rules that take place outside the realm of
the game (komi, pie rule) are a variation of a game and should always
be considered optional balancing rules, and are covered in laws of the
game, not core rules  (komi exists after the game is over.  pie rule
exists before the game starts.  while the game is ongoing, it has no
effect).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pie rule, ugly though it is, makes many games extremely well balanced,
especially finely scalable games like Hex which <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>have<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> slightly
disadvantageous first moves available.  Not every game has that.  In some
games, every first move is advantageous, but even there the pie rule helps.
It forces you to make one of the least advantageous first moves.

The slightness of the first move disadvantage in games like Hex with the pie
rule grows slighter with increasing board size.  Since Hex (with pie) can be
played on even or odd boards, you don't have to increase the board size
dramatically (i.e. from one odd size to the next larger odd size) to create
a slew of less disadvantageous first moves.  If you're willing to play on a
large enough board, you can effectively reduce the move order advantage at
your skill level to zero.  Any theoretically non-zero first move
disadvantage at that large size would be overwhelmed by the effect of
distractions such as a buzzing fly, etc.

Anyways these are the three proposed rule zeros i can think of, anyone
else got any suggestions?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think the pie rule should be an option in every game, independent as it is
of the actual gameplay.  It would never be used in Chess because it would
chop too much out of an already spindly game tree.  You wouldn't have shit
left to work with after that.  Chess players readily agree that the pie rule
is crap, but this is merely a consequence of the fact that Chess is crap.

No pie = luck.  Without the pie rule, the initial coin toss is a sweat
inducing event.  I don't like the sweaty coin toss.  It's even uglier than
the pie rule.  Chess fanatics "solve" this problem, lol, by playing an even
number of times, turning an already draw swamped game into an even more
boring, more drawn out, more draw prone match.

I wonder what effect the pie rule would have in Go, i.e. if there are any
slightly disadvantageous first moves.
