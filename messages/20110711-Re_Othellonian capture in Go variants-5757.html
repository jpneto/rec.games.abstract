Rising from the realms of apathy I found a few thoughts to spare about
'othellonian capture in Go variants'. It's a provisional overview open
to additions, corrections, modifications, suggestions and, to avoid
excluding anyone, ridicule.
Please have a Go @ it:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/arena/sygo/621-othellonian">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/arena/sygo/621-othellonian</a>

It looks interesting!

I haven't finished reading it yet, but I'd like to point out something
before I forget: I am not the inventor of Reversi Go, however much it
flatters me to be considered as such. I simply found that variant at
Sensei's Library while exploring the Go Variants section. If I
remember correctly, the author doesn't identify himself, and it could
well be one of those natural games which are invented many times
independently.

Also, I think my own Paper and Pencil Go (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/">http://senseis.xmp.net/</a>?
PaperAndPencilGo) would fit in your list, even if its balance between
life and death is not completely satisfactory. A simultaneous capture
rule, as I mention in the Sensei's Library article, would help correct
it, as groups with a single two-points eye aren't still
unconditionally alive. With this rule in effect, marked stones
shouldn't secure life when touched by both players' stones, as it
would be the case in ko-like positions. (I must definitely edit the
Sensei's Library article to reflect this. Or maybe call it Paper and
Pencil Go 2.)

Ok, thanks, I'll correct the authorship asap and I'll await your
corrections before adding Paper and Pencil Go.
