On a line similar to the chess type game, there is a game "Calvin Cards."
It is of course based on Calvinball in Calvin &amp; Hobbes, where you make the
rules as you go along.

The game starts with the flow of play of Crazy Eights or Seven, but with no
cards that have special effect. The initial deck is 2 52-card decks and 4
jokers, with the jokers initially undefined.

The first round of play is normal. At the end of each round, the player who
goes out gets to make a rule. The rule may not be player-specific, but
otherwise may be anything, and immediately goes on the books, without a vote.
(You can play that <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>unanimous<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> refusal cancels a rule, if need be.)

As in the previous post, the object is to have fun. Rules involving running
around the table, etc, are perfectly legal. Enjoy!
