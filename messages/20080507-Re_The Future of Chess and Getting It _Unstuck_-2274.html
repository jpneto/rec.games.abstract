None, by definition.  There is no such thing as a problem that

The reason everyone is so interested in Quantum Computers is the
potentially speed at which (in theory) they can solve certain
problems.  The reason we aren't all sitting in front ofTuring
Machinesis the slow speed at which they solve most problems.

While there has been progress in practical implementation of Quantum
Computing since it was written (in 1999), the theory of the case
remains about where David Deutsch left it in his classic paper:Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics (David Deutsch, Artur Ekert,
Rossella Lupacchini)  In that paper, the convenience of thinking that
all computing can be reduced to an equivalentTuringmachine is
considered and rejected.http://xyz.lanl.gov/abs/math.HO/9911150
"As a matter of fact, Richard Feynman, in his talk during the First
Conference on the Physics of Computation held at MIT in 1981, observed
that it appears to be impossible to simulate a general quantum
evolution on a classical probabilistic computer in an efficient way
[4].

   That is largely because the only thing Feynman knew about
   computers or computations was main frame computers.
   But since most of today's computations depend on massively
   parellel networks, not mainframes, his observation  mostly
   concern 1950s Burroughs history, not computers.



That is to say, any classical simulation of quantum evolution
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
involves an exponential slowdown in time compared with the natural
evolution, since the amount of information required to describe the
evolving quantum state in classical terms generally grows
exponentially with time."

My question was in the spirit of Deutsch's  claim:
"Now we are forced to leave that definition behind. Henceforward, a
proof must be regarded as a process the computation itself  for we
must accept that in future, quantum computers will prove theorems by
methods that neither a human brain nor any other arbiter will ever be
able to check step-by-step, since if the sequence of propositions
corresponding to such a proof were printed out, the paper would fill
the observable universe many times over."

Having said (and quoted) all that--the question is:
Would a set of simple extensions to the rules in the spirit of
Schrodinger's Cat  Chess  make it impossible for a computer other than
a Quantum Computer to make 40 moves within 2 hours?- Hide quoted text -
