It seems an interesting twist on the Short Circuit pattern for Nick Bentley's MindNinja. I quote from the rules, available on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.igGameCenter.com">www.igGameCenter.com</a> once you start a MindNinja game:

SHORT CIRCUIT

The board must be full of stones, and the longest red "short circuit" must be longer than the longest blue "short circuit" [for Red to win].

A "short circuit" is defined as the shortest chain of like-colored stones connecting two stones of the same color.

This pattern was invented by Harald Korneliussen in 2008.

In your game, you have to choose the longest path between a male and a female, but I wonder if that's a good idea. If you have only one huge group, you can just connect your first pair by going through all your stones.

When I read the comments made recently by you I was not surprised at all. My first impressions were right.
Finally I reached to the definitive conclusion that you are deeply dumb.
You and the ayatollah of bgg forum Russ you will never apprehend what is the core of any game. You are obsessed by details and you do not see the more important : the game play.
Nick Bentley is a big plagiarizer.
He never invented anything but mimicking.
Fertility is maybe the most fascinating game of the 21 century and you are not aware of it.
Soon you will see the game sold in the french market first.
