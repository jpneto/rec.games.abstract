I like your goal-oriented approach.  Having recently accumulated
a fair number of abstract board games including modern ones,
I find tracing the evolution of game mechanisms fascinating; however,
as you say it may be impossible to classify games this way due to the
"multiple inheritance" problem.  While game mechanism or "rules" are
perhaps more suggestive of the flavor of a game to a new-comer,
it seems to me an experienced player will learn to be goal oriented.
To put your theory into practice :-) here's how I might define a
hierarchical "schema" for abstract board games and then apply it:

game
  GOALS
  outcome
    strategic
      tactical
        RULES
        capture
          movement
            board/setup

(It may be interesting to note that game instructions go bottom-up,
whereas game "instruction" works top-down.)

go: territory/boundary/connection//surround/vacant/19x19
Othello: territory/mobility/boundary//sandwich/capture/8x8-fixed-open
KnockOut: territory/boundary/?//sandwich/adjacent/4hex-minus-center
hex: line/defense/connection//none/vacant/diamond-shaped-hex-board

(Someone more expert than I please comment, and add to the list)
