In  rec.games.abstract  David desJardins  answered a complaint of mine about
stalemate, with the astute observation that stalemate in chess may occur even if
the rules made no mention of "check", but insisted that the players keep moving
until a king was actually captured, (as me and many others think more natural).

David gave a (partial) position where a player simply <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>couldnt<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> move, not
because of check, but because all squares were physically blocked.  His example
actually had all the non-mover's pieces still on the board (though up at the
wrong end!); but this is not necessary, and a no-moves position could "more
easily" occur something like this...

        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  ...with other white pieces not shown.

Sorry if I've got the letters conventionally wrong; black (capitals) at the top.


Now my puzzle:  
           What is the shortest possible stalemate of this no-move-at-all type ?  

I know Sam Lloyd produced the (allegedly) shortest possible stalemate, (10 moves
by white), and ditto for a no-captures-made stalemate, (12 moves, by black).

But I can't recall this "no-move-available-stalemate" anywhere in a puzzle
book before.

The usual chocloate fish will be awarded to the shortest answer produced.

         If anyone disagrees with anything I say, I am quite prepared 
    not only to retract it, but also to deny under oath that I ever said it.
