I'm pretty sure Mornington Crescent was solved in the early 1960s.  Was it
Minski?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I do believe you are thinking of the American Standard Imperial Variation
which was popular in New York Clubs in the 1930s and 1940s.  After the
Second World War it lost ground to other variations because of its limited
possibilities.  The weakness of this Variation was indeed confirmed by
Minski solving it in 1964, as part of a post-graduate research project.  Not
surprisingly, "The Mornington Crescent Compendium" does not regard the
American Standard Imperial Variation as an official version of Mornington
Crescent, and it is widely perceived to be an inferior mutation of the
traditional game.

Surely Minski's 'sausage' manoeuvre, after which ASIV reduces to one of 
eleven solvable configurations [see note] once Shaved Ape is forced, is 
usable in almost any variation that employs the Oblong or 'Bismarck' 
rule?  It may not win, but it could be unbalancing, because whoever 
comes out strongest in underpass (or its equivalent) may be able to take 
on a so-called 'kingmaker' role.  

Note: Of course the win is not completely proved if West interrupts the 
sausage with an early Heimlich, but this is not enough to rescue the 
variation.  Although the resultant combinatorial explosion could not 
practicably be solved outright in Minski's day (even modern computers 
might be hard-pressed to analyse it completely), it was generally 
accepted that there is only one possible outcome, even if 'bog rush' and 
cross-control tactics can delay the inevitable.  Minski never hid this 
imperfection in his proof, and it did not affect his doctorate.  
However, it led to disputes in the early years with die-hard ASIV 
devotees unwilling to accept that the proof was nevertheless sufficient.

Perhaps as a consequence of the formally less-than-conclusive proof, 
Minski never got the recognition he deserved - or not, at least, until 
it was far too late.  He was unable to secure academic work commensurate 
with his talents, and became insecure and probably depressed.  In 1968 
he claimed to be receiving half-eaten sausages in the post, but never 
produced any evidence, and there is no record of any complaint to the 
authorities.  One photograph from this time shows a strange figure in 
long hair and colourful, possibly even home-made clothing - not 
completely unheard-of at the time perhaps, but a remarkable contrast 
with the dapper young student of a few years previously.  Another 
picture from around the same time shows him in more conventional attire 
(he was to attend a court hearing concerning a relatively minor but 
unsavoury matter, the details of which I prefer not to discuss here).  
Although at first glance he looks little different from his 1964 
persona, the eyes look lost and vacant, and I do not believe it is an 
artefact of the photographic process.

[The information and images relating to Minski's life in the late '60s 
come from E. R. Smith's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Curse Of Mornington Crescent<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (now, alas, 
long out of print).  Although Smith's "grisly but light-hearted romp 
through the ages" is not exactly reliable (the tales relating to pre-
Romanic Egypt are almost certainly apocryphal) he is better when he can 
collate printed media, and for more recent events in his compendium he 
often conducted postal interviews with witnesses - including the sad 
story of Minski's decline, which he follows in salacious detail until 
1972, then abandons.  Smith makes no mention at all of Minski's death, 
and was probably unaware of it.]
