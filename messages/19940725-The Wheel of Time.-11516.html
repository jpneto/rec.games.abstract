I live in South Africa and we have only got up to book 5 in the Wheel of
Time series (ie The Fires of Heaven). Once again you people seem to be ahead
of me in this series and I was wondering what book you people have got up
to. Please don't tell me any of the story as I knew most of what happened in
the FoH and it was not as exciting as the rest of the books that I read.
(This could also be due to the fact that Perrin was not in this book).
Anyway, can anyone tell me what book you are up to and when the others are
expected to arrive.

Very hard to be a part of this site if you hardly know what everyone else is
talking about !
