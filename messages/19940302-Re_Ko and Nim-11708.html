here's a game
for you.  The game is just nim with 2 extra rules.  The first is 
that when a player removes counters from a pile they are placed in
a discard pile.  In addition to the normal nim moves a player may
return some or all of the discard pile to any one pile.  The second
rule is the super ko rule : a player may not make a move which 
repeats a previous position.

This game neatly points up an ambiguity in the definition of Nim, as it's
usually described. Is the game decided by "the winning player is the one
who takes the last counter" or "the first player who cannot move loses" ?
In standard Nim, these rules are equivalent. But look what happens in the
above version, when we start with an initial pile of just two counters:

Starting from the position &lt;2&gt;, I sweep both counters into the discard pile,
leaving &lt;0&gt;, an empty table. Using the "last counter rule" I have won. But
my opponent insists on playing until one of us has no legal move left, and
restores one counter from the discard to give position &lt;1&gt;. Now I've lost,
because any move I make repeats an earlier position!

The original post was addressed to " those of you familiar with Berlekamp theory"
so I guess we have to go with the "No legal move" criterion for ending a game.
In which a case a single pile of &lt;n&gt; counters is a win for the first player exactly
when n is odd.

Unfortunately you can't combine the results for single piles to solve the
general game, the way you can with Nim, because the discard piles from
the "sub-games" get merged, so I haven't got a full solution yet. As a
variant on the original posting, what happens if you allow the move of
taking counters from the discard to form a <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>new<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> pile ( so a game that
started &lt;3,4,5&gt; could later become &lt;2, 3, 3, 4&gt; ) ?
