But what about a game whose score would
depend on the exact position of the first (or for that matter N'th)
repeat?  Imagine a game where the rules say the game ends whenever a
position is repeated twice (as in chess), but with the additional
caveat that the score might vary depending on the actual position when
this 2nd repeat occurs (in chess, the score of the 2nd repeat is
0=draw)?

Re-reading my message, I realize that I may not have made myself
clear.

Imagine an abstract zero-sum game where among all of the millions of
possible endgame positions happen to exist 3 positions, X, Y, and Z
where X-&gt;Y, Z-&gt;Y and both Y-&gt;X or Y-&gt;Z

If X has a score of 1, Y a score of 2, and Z a score of 3 if the game
draws by repetition on the respective position, then among possible
scenarios might be these two:

... X Y X Y Z Y (2nd repeat.  score = 2)
... X Y X Y X (2nd repeat.  score = 1)

In this type of game, how should the retrograde analysis algorithm be
set up to compute the endgame database for this type of game?

If there is an overall rule about how many repeats there can be, so that
the game actually has no infinite move chains, you can "terminalize" all
of the repeating positions by having the states keep track of how they
were reached.  I.e., convert {X&gt;Y, Z&gt;Y, Y&gt;X, Z&gt;X} to
{X&gt;XY, XY&gt;XYX, XYX&gt;XYXY, XYXY&gt;XYXYX (terminal, score=1),
                         XYXY&gt;XYXYZ, XYXYZ&gt;XYXYZY (terminal, score=2),
       XY&gt;XYZ, ...
 Z&gt;ZY, ...
 Y&gt;YX, ...
 Y&gt;YZ, ...
}

So, the "Y" state is expanded into 19 different states internally (if I
have counted correctly), 10 of which are terminal, and 9 of which are
not yet "long enough" to end the game.  These states do not have any
loopiness, so they can be analyzed normally.
