Could you please present a sample game on a small board?  The game
does look intriguing but I don't fully understand the rules.

Oh, sure! Here is one:

P.S.:

A is teaching B how to play Ayu. This is the dialogue that followed:

B: So what did you say the name of this game was?
A: It's AYU (As Yet Unnamed).
B: Oh, and what must I do to win?
A: AYU (Attach Your Units).
B: I got it, man, but how many of them?
A (sighs): AYU (All Your Units).
(A while later:)
B (making a winning move, at his pieces): AYU? (Are You United?)
A (angry, at B): AYU? (Are You Unbalanced?)

I'm definitely settling on Ayu as a name for the game :-)

The sample game was interesting to follow.  The basic tactics seem to
revolve around joining groups more efficiently than the opponent does,
capitalizing on the rule that lets you move to any adjacent point in a
group.  But I'm curious about the restriction that you can't split the
group any time during the move.  Is this really necessary?  The need
for it, if there is one, is not at all obvious to me.
