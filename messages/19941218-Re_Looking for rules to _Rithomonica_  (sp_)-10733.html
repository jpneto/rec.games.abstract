The game you describe matches one I have seen called "Rithmomachia"-- I 
got the rules from <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Old Board Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> by R. [C.?] Bell.  It originated in 
medieval times and rivaled chess in reputation for complexity and the 
perceived level of intelligence necessary to play the game.  It's played 
on a 16 x 8 board with pieces as you describe.  There are several defined 
types of victories, of which the players agree upon one before beginning 
play.

The game was also featured on the April spread of the 1994 Mathematics 
Calendar, published by Science [News?] Books, though the rules there were 
not as complete as in the Bell book.

I am <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> interested in finding others with whom to discuss (and maybe 
play?) the game.  Please e-mail me directly.
