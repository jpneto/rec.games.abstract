Stone placement game definition: Players 1 and 2, designated Black and White
respectively, take turns placing a single stone of their own color on an
unoccupied cell (or intersection) on the board.  The placement may by itself
complete a turn, or the player may conclude his turn by removing black
stones and white stones from the board.

How do you guarantee that the game will end?  Well, the simplest way is not
to have capturing and just let the board fill up.  This impacts robustness
though.   On an odd sized grid, Black will have the first move, the last
move, and altogether one more move than White.  All of this will either be
an advantage or a disadvantage to Black, but not neither.

So you add capturing to your design, lots of capturing.  Now Black still has
the first move but it's unknown who will have the last move or who will
ultimately make more moves.  Much better.  But now with all this capturing,
it becomes non-trivial how to design finitude into the game.

One special position I always consider when designing stone placement games
is roughly this: White has completely filled the left half of the board and
Black has completely filled the right half.  Two questions: "What happens
now?" and "How do you prevent this position from repeating itself?"

In Go, said special position would be pretty much as described.  The whole
board would be filled in except for the center point.  White's stones would
be roughly on the left half and Black's on the right.  The player on turn
(not necessarily Black) would move onto the center point, killing the other
player's group, and it would then be the other player's turn to move.

Go bluntly addresses the repeat position question with the brutish superko
rule.  Players are simply forbidden from creating the special position again
(with the same player on turn).

Tanbo rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Tanbo_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Tanbo_rules.pdf</a>

For Tanbo, the special position would be a white, root-like structure
filling the left side of the board, a black, root-like structure filling the
right side, not necessarily of equal size, and each group only having one
legal move available - a suicide move.  The player on turn would remove his
group, ending the game.

Tanbo prevents a repeat of the special position simply by ending the game
when all groups of one color have been removed.  Players begin the game with
8 groups of size one (single stones) each.  On your turn you expand one and
only one of your groups, so you never have more than 8.  Once all of the
groups of a given color have been removed, there are no more groups left to
expand for the ousted player, and the game is over.

Oust rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_rules.pdf</a>

For Oust, the special position would be a white group nearly filling the
left side of the board (possibly imbedded with black stones), a black group
of equal size nearly filling the right side (possibly imbedded with white
stones), with a single width, vertical line of empty cells separating the
two groups.  The player on turn would place a stone somewhere in the space,
connecting the two groups, and killing the enemy group (and embedded enemy
stones) by doing so.

In Oust, as in Tanbo, the game ends by definition here, preventing a repeat
of the special position.  Once all stones of one color have been eliminated
from the board in Oust, the game is over.

Rive rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Rive_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Rive_rules.pdf</a>

For Rive, the special position would be a white group filling the left side
of the board, a black group of equal size filling the right side, with a
single width, vertical line of empty cells separating the two groups.  The
player on turn would place a stone somewhere in the space, connecting the
two groups.  The player placing the stone would then remove enough black
stones and/or white stones from the new, single, larger group to reduce its
size to the previous group size plus one.

Rive prevents the special position from repeating by creating ever larger
groups.  In the special position, the largest group size was n.  Then it was
n+1.  It can never go back to n, thereby preventing the special position
from occurring again.
