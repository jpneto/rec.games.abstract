Big question, slightly tangential:
Is Tri-Tactics, or indeed L'Attaque or Dover Patrol (or the other one whose
name escapes me) considered better or worse than Stratego?

I tend to feel there is too much luck in Stratego, but I have met people
who can win confidently more times than not, which seems to suggest a high
skill element.

If both sides play defensively, they are effectively agreeing to a draw.
The same is true of most games, where the two sides can always agree a draw
if they wish.  If one side defends and the other attacks, I think I would
favour the attacker, at least if he/she is sensible and prepares the attack
on their own terms to their advantage.

I don't see how a computer could play it well, though, as most of the skill
seems to come from the psychology element of the game.  Perhaps if the 
computer tried to work out a basic idea of how a person plays, or is that
too complex?  If you don't have some of that element, I think you ought to
be doomed to failure, though.
