I must be confused about the rules.

Can you give an example of a small game, played out.
Don't worry about optimal play -- I just need to
understand the rules.

When one of the plates is empty,
then in the case of "justice"
you really get Nim; and in the case
on "injustice" you get the anti-Nim game.
This gives you plenty of examples already.

It seems that the most important
parameter of justice/injustice is
minPlate -- the minimal number of
stones on any of the plates at the initial
position. When minPlate=0 then you get
Nim/anti-Nim. The the winning strategy
is well known. Thus it is natural to consider
next the games with minPlate=1.

BTW, a minor, trivial point about the positions
which have equal number of stones in the
initial 0-th position: I say "don't worry, just
play the game". Seriously, we look at question
of equality of the plates only AFTER a move.
Initially, there was no move and no issue.

OK, now we may look at a specific instance,
when there are two plates, and the initial
distribution of stones is:

(P0)    1  1

after move 1 the position may be

(P1)    1  0

the game goes on, the next position must be:

(P2)    0  0
n
If it was "justice" the the 2nd player won.
If they played "injustice" then the first
player won.

In general, if in the initial position
there are n plates, each with 1 stone,
then:

for "justice", the position is won
for the 1st player when n were odd; and
for the 2nd player if n were even.

for "injustice" the position is won for
the 1st player if n is even, and it's
won for the 2nd player if n is even.

***

Consider the initial position with 2 plates:

(P0)   a  b

Consider "justice". If a =/= b  then the first
player wins in one move by turning to:

(P1)  min(a b)   min(a b)

If a=b then any move by 1st player leads
to a one-move win for the 2nd player.

***

The 2-plate injustice is more complicated.
In the position:

(P0)  a  0

the first player is lost for a=1
and wins if a &gt; 1 (for a=0 there is
no game--there should be at least 1 stone
on one of the plates).

In the position

(P0)    a  1

the first player is lost for a=0
and wins if a &gt; 0.

***

Continue with the 2-plate injustice.

(P0)  a  b

where, say,  a &gt;/ b &gt; 1. Neither player
wants to leave a configuration  A  B,
where min(A B) &lt; 2, except for the winning
configurations  1  0  and  0  1, or else
the opponent on the next move will be able
to reach  1  0  or  0  1, and win.

We see that position:

(P0)  2  2

is lost for the first player.

It follows that position

(P0)  a  2

is won for the first player, for any a &gt; 2.

Etc., i.e., by induction, we get the
following modest theorem:

THEOREM  The 2-plate injustice game, with the
=======  initial position:

(P0)  a  b

is won for the first player in each of the
following cases:

(i) a =/= b, and min(a b) &gt; 1 -- then
passing to position  (P1) min(a b) min(a b)
is the winning move);

(ii) min(a b) &lt; 2, while max(a b) &gt; 0 -- then
passing to  1  0  or  to  0  1  wins for
the first player.

In all other cases of (P0) the 1st player
is lost, and the 2nd can win.

Best regards,

Wlod
