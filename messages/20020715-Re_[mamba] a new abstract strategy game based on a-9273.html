<div class="moz-text-flowed">As explain by Richard, as soon as I will have finished to translate the 
content in english, I will do a more "open" version of the website.
<br>
<br>We will also try to develop a email version.
<br>
<br>As a conclusion to this discussion, you must remind that's it's still an 
ongoing process, I did this web site on the demand of players (it's them 
you ask for flash) on my extra time, playing is completly free and there 
is no advertising banners on the web site... so even if you have 
constructive feedback, compare with things that could be compare.
<br>
<br>I have notice all the relevant feedback from Richard, and will try to 
improve this website.
<br>
<br>
<br>Even if some people don't like it... many people really enjoy it ! And I 
just want to add, that flash &amp; internet opens a great perspective for 
abstract board games... at every minute of the day, you can find someone 
to play with (which is not the case in the real life). Flash offers to 
have a full functionnal game who wheight only 38ko... and I still think 
that it's a real good thing for players. At the difference of Yahoo, 
it's not only live games, you can start and stop and resume it after 
(you can have a email to notice when your opponent did his turn)... as a 
player I should say that I really enjoy it ;-)
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>

<br>A "universal" version of flash would be a good start.&nbsp; Not version
<br>6 which only runs on Windows OSes.
<br>
<br>You might consider at least making the rules available without
<br>flash.&nbsp; and if you have that "open", others might start supporting
<br>your game via their means.&nbsp; e.g. I run <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@gamerz.net">pbmserv@gamerz.net</a>, an Email
<br>based abstract game server.

<br><blockquote type=cite>As explain by email to Ralf... mamba is a game so not just static 
content (so it's more important to be abble to play than to just read 
the rules). You may not appreciate Flash... but I don't know better 
solution for the moment to offer with an application of 38Ko with no 
download the possbility to play freely (and with no advertising 
banner) a game with players from all over the internet... When you 
will propose a better solution (meaning by that that jave is not a 
good solution), I will use it with great pleasure. The platform is a 
linux, php, mysql classical one using xml with flash so open to any 
possible client.
<br>
<br>Again thanks for your warm feedback ;-)
<br>
<br>Let's talk about solution ;-)

<br>
<br>I'm the author of a new abstract strategy game mamba. I've seen a
<br>message from Sacha about the game... just few things to add, yes the
<br>game is based on alife aspects (ie the pieces are alive) and yes the
<br>concept is more similar to Go than chess. But one important 
thing, is
<br>that this game is a king of dynamic system to play with so after any

funny
<br>tactics for the game... a kind of guerilla strategy is the better 
way
