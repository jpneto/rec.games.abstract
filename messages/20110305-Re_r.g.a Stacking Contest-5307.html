No, Alex, you didn't, and you totally missed a couple of points.  A public
vote would turn the game contest into a designer popularity contest, slanted
in favor of folk hero Christian Freeling and against villain Mark Steere,
who laughs in the face of 6.3 magnitude earthquakes, thereby unfairly
advantaging Christian's entry in the contest and unfairly disadvantaging my
entry.

The public is stupid, Alex.  Call it coincidence.  You yourself have
provided an outstanding example.  You literally told me that you would
deduct points from Monkey Queen because it isn't really a stacking game in
your view.  Never mind that the contest very specifically allows for the
most generous interpretation of stacking.  You think I want your ignorant
vote in the contest, Alex?  You think I want hoards of like-minded, ignorant
masses voting on my game??  Guess again.

Ok.  Some of us, or maybe just one of us, design simply for the pleasure of
designing.  Sure it's nice when a game develops a strong player base, but
that's not the driving force, at least not for me.  I'll grant you this
"axiom" though for the purpose of the argument at hand.

And now I've got an axiom of my own to posit:

Axiom C:  The purpose of a game contest is to determine the best game in the
contest.

Surprised????  Boy, axiom C really got lost in the shuffle here!

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Christian Freeling rehash, and it's still baloney.  A
shiotty game won't "build and maintain a strong player base" just because it
got publicly voted on.

Also, since the winner of the contest may not be the true
winner, doing what is best for the whole set of games is
probably more important than who ultimately wins.  Thus,
i think we should do whatever draws the most attention to
the contest, which is open voting.

Right.  "As long as the contest will never be perfectly fair, and since it's
really just a glorified marketing stunt anyway, might as well turn it into a
complete circus.  Invite the stupid public and Christian Freeling's vast fan
base, and fuck axiom C."

I really don't care if the contest could be "more".  Why does everything
have to be capitalized on?  We can't just have a contest for fun.  No, it
has to be transformed into big business, a whirlwind marketing blitz.  And
for what??  The games are ultimately going to sink or swim on their own
merits, not how many people got to vote on them.  So you totally trash the
contest, and "ultimately" accomplish shit squat for the games.
