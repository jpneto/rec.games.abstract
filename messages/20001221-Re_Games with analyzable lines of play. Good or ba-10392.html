That doesn't explain preempts. The partnerships can block each other,

Which is why I said bridge bidding was a lossy channel.

The key thing is that the Bridge

seen in the multiplicity of different conventions used in club and
tournament play.

Only small-minded players enforce their conventions rigidly. Better
players know that conventions establish a semantic framework which is
itself subject to manipulation in order to achieve strategic
goals. (FWIW, I'm a professional computer geek who specializes in
network protocols so my view may be slightly unorthodox - plus I'm a
notoriously successful 'psychic' bidder).

I don't believe the rules of bridge are well-defined.

Errr. Well-defined is a very technical term for me, and I would
certainly say that the bridge rules <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> well-defined. As you mention
later there is a lot of etiquette, but that is not really part of the
well-defined rules. OTOH, I mostly play casual rubber Bridge, not
tournament duplicate where there is a much stronger emphasis on
nailing down every aspect of the game.

1) If your partner knows that you make psychic bids, your partner should
alert essentially everything or otherwise make this clear.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, I find the definition of `psychic' problematic, to say the
least. My basic system is Sheinwold which is a very 'natural' system,
but I know how to effectively lie in it. I rarely let my partners
down (and they often don't know what is really going on, either), but
we do end up in strange (but makeable) contracts.

2) Your partnership's bidding conventions are supposed to be
symmetric.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Err...compatible. One guy I've played with a lot is a Goren fan. We're
compatible, but we function differently wrt the precise boundaries on
many bids. If you use a strongly artificial system like Italian, you
must be symmetrical or else you're going to end up in impossible
contracts.

Does your partner make psychic bids the same way you do,

No, AFAICT, my 'psychic' bids are a peculiarity of the way I view the
game (as being about communications).

My opponents usually ask.

3) If you ban destructive bids at the 1 level, (e.g., 1 spade indicating

You're straying outside the 'well-defined' set of Bridge rules here. I
don't consider any bid illegal as long as it is well-formed.

Etiquette. The best bridge players I know are highly unethical. The

hear them cross-talk though.

That's true and it's part of why I don't play club duplicate. OTOH,
defensive bidding can wreak havoc on those kinds of structures.
