I can already hear the cries, "More draws??  My God, that's the LAST thing we
need!"

Very true, but this wouldn't be the fault of the swap rule.  The swap rule
would have done its job and it would have done it well... it cut our "pie"
into two nearly equal slices.  More draws would be the "fault" of our beloved
game itself.

It may not be the fault of the swap rule, but the percentage of draws in
master level games would almost certainly increase all the same, if one-
move equalization is used. Do you propose other rule changes to reduce the
incidence of draws?

If the swap rule were implemented, what would a fair opening move be, knowing
that Black  now has the option to swap it?  Certainly not 1.e4 or 1.d4.
1.Nc3?  1.b4?  1.a3?  What would you play tomorrow, as White, if the tourney
you entered adopted the swap rule?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

These openings have been tried and largely abandoned by strong players because
they are too drawish under standard rules. Maybe 5-move equalization would
stir up the pot better. Which side of 1.e4 2.e5 3.Nf3 4.f5 5.Bc4 would you
want to be on?
