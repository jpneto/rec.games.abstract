One very objective observation about Stackers: If I were playing, I
wouldn't be committed to either offensive or defensive play.  But I
would be firmly committed to not being the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to place a stack of
my checkers on a stack of enemy checkers.  My reasoning being that
when I jump on you, the first thing that may happen is that you move
forward and push me back.

If you have covered an enemy stack with your own, the enemy can't push
you back.  He would have to first cover the stack with one of his, and
that allows you to respond by adding one of your own, etc.

I'm sure such cascades will be common in the game, and knowing which to
fight and which to not fight will be central to the game.

This is not unlike Go, where knowing when to fight to keep a group is
central to the game.

A comparison with Chess players moving their rooks from side to side
is misleading at best, not to mention the fact that that could
actually happen in a game of Chess between non-cooperating players.

It is not at all misleading, since all your scenarios for draws in
Stackers depend on players cooperating to achieve this.  You claim that
"old grandmothers" might well believe non-commital play to be the best
strategy, but "old grandmothers" might equally well believe that moving
a rook back and forth is a valid defensive strategy in Chess.

But, by all means, let us play a few games to see how they pan out.
