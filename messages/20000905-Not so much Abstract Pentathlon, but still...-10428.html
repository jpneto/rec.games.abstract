Hi again,

still on the subject of Abstract Pentathlon, I'm seeing that
some people started to talk about games that doesn't
fit so well in the set of abstract games, at least as many
of us see them.

Anyway, some two years ago, I also posted another
idea on this subject, but then the proposal was a mixed
one. Some physical sports, some mental ones
"Mens sana in corpore sano" (or something like that...)

A very conservative proposal would be:

* Running
* Swimming

* Chess
* Go

and some mixed sport, like bow and arrow, or gun shooting
if it would be chosen a sport favoring coordination.
Even a martial art or something similar would fit in the middle.

Another modern proposals, would include modern
games and modern sports, or even mixing both
old and modern in both groups.

It reminds me of Bilal's Chess Boxing :-)

Best Regards,

Joao Neto
