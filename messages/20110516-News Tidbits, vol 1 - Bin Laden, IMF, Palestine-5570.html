As long as we're waiting for Daniel to close out the contest, might as well
pass the time with some world news tidbits.

BIN LADEN

We (Americans) killed Bin Laden.  The "You can run but you can't hide"
shtick loses some of its punch when you find out that Bin Laden spent most
of the past decade hiding.  Not running.  Bin Laden easily could have died
of old age in his compound had he not slipped up.

The official story had been that Bin Laden was on the run, moving from cave
to cave.  And that he wasn't real important anyway - just a washed up figure
head.  But now that we killed him there's an update to the official story
line.  Now all of a sudden Bin Laden is the big, important head of Al Qaeda
again.  That update was about as credible as the deflated "You can run but
you can't hide" claim. Was Bin Laden important or not important?  Get your
God damn story straight, Washington.

Kudos, bravo, yeah we got him.  Big deal.  Who gives a shit?  It gave people
an excuse to take to the streets and get drunk.  Duh.  Overall it was an
embarrassment.  The fact that it took ten fucking years to find him. The
fact that we spent a trillion dollars in the process.

Speaking of ten years, it took New York about that long just to get started
on the new building at ground zero.  Whatever happened to the "New York
minute"?  Dwuh.  (Duh with a New York accent.)

IMF

Busy news month.  We've got the future president of France in (where else?)
a New York jail.  What the fuck is it with these European politicians who
can't keep their dick in their pants?  Imagine the horror of the hotel maid
witnessing this 62 year old goat charging out of the bathroom naked, long
hanging balls swinging wildly under sagging belly fat, with a French gleam
in his eye....   GROSS!!!!

ARAB SPRING

Stop harassing Israel.  Guess what?  The Israelis aren't going away. 
Fucking deal with it.  You think they're all going to pack up and leave
because you stage an infantile, foot-stomping tantrum at their border?  Fuck
off already.

Of course Israel didn't help the situation by withholding the wages of
Palestinians who worked in Israel.

Israel: "Well, see, it's like this.  The Palestinians signed a contract with
Hamas and...."

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.  It's them! lol  When there's an international
outcry over your policy, you're doing something wrong.  Very wrong.  Who do
you think those mobs at your borders are comprised of?  Workers who worked
for you and didn't get paid.  They did the work.  Now give them their damn
money.
