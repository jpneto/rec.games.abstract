  The traffic on this group has died recently - is no one doing interesting
  stuff with games?

  I thought I'd post some results for a game called Slime Trail - invented
  (as far as we know) by Bill Taylor. He and I corresponded for a while
  re: game trees and strategy for this game, and this is what we came up
  with:

  Slimetrail:
    played on an NxM rectangle of squares. Each player takes turns moving
    a piece around the board. The piece can take one step orthogonally,
    and may not re-visit a visited square. Each player tries to move
    the piece into his/her goal square. The two goal squares are located
    at diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. The piece starts on
    any mutually agreed upon square.

    Note: It doesn't matter which player actually ends up moving the 
	  piece into a goal square; just the fact that it is there means
	  that someone won.

  Normal slime trail:
    A first player win exists, starting from any square, provided at least
    one of the board dimensions is even. On an odd by odd board, winning
    and losing start squares alternate in a checkerboard pattern. A draw is
    only possible via cooperation; if one player moves to avoid draws, the
    other can never force them. We're still wondering if the winning/losing
    start square pattern means there is an easy strategy for this game that
    neither of us has seen yet.

  Variations:
    Chess king slime trail: The piece moved around the board has the movement
    capabilities of a chess king. Results for small boards (1st player 
    goes to upper left, 2nd to lower right)

      W = Winning start square for 1st player, assuming perfect play.
      L = Losing start square for 1st player
      T = Tied game with perfect play. (A game is tied if neither player
	  has a move)

       3x3       4x3       4x4         4x5           3x5
      * W L    * W W L    * W L W    * W W W    * W W W L
      W W W    W W W W    W W W L    W W W W    W W W W W
      L W *    L W W *    L W W W    W W W W    L W W W *
			  W L W *    W W W W
			             W W W *

    (the additional movement capabilities makes deep search difficult)
    Seems to be biased toward the 1st player, with losses only cccuring
    (sometimes) in the vincinity of the non-goal corners. It should be noted
    that some of the start squares marked W have only one winning move out
    of the eight available, and the direction of that winning move is not
    obvious at all - so they still make for fairly good games.


    Hex slime trail, targets in obtuse corner: Probably the best version
    of this game. Here's some small board results:

      4x4         5x5          5x4         4x6
        * W T L    * W T W T    * W T W T    * W T L
       W W L T    W W W W W    W W W W W    W W L T
      T L W W    T W W W T    W W W W W    T L W W
     L T W *    W W W W W    W T T W *    W W L T
	       T W T W *                 T L W W
        				L T W *
    I think this variation is 'best' because of relative balance of
    start squares that lead to W, L, or T. We really haven't playtested this
    one enough to vouch for superior play-ability.


    Hex slime trail, targets in acute corner:

      4x4, 4x5: all squares win for 1st player

      5x5
      * W T T T
       W L T T T
        T T L T T
         T T T L W
          T T T W *

      Draws are too easy to come by in this version.
