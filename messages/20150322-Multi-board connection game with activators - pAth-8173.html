This is an idea I looked at a while ago, but it didn't quite work, so I'm re-looking. The basic idea is simply a connection game where players can move each other's pieces back, and use each other's activators. FOollowing are the original rules:

pAth, a 4D connection game, with activators:
Each side has 16 "connectors" and 2 activators
The board is a 4x4 array of 4x4 "tiles", totaling 256 squares and 16 tiles.
Connectors move on squares, activators move on tiles.
connectors move as forward-sideways wazirs, stepping 1 square orthogonally forward or sideways. A connector moves from one square to another within a tile, or moves to the corresponding square in the forward or sideways tile. Connectors may never be moved backwards by the owner.
Activators may leap to any of the 16 tiles.
No piece may be in the same location as another piece - 1 connector per square, one activator per tile.
To start, each player's 16 connectors are placed in the back/closest row of squares in the tiles closest to that player, forming a 16 unit line across the board. One activator is placed in the back left tile (with 4 of the connectors), and the other is placed 2 tiles right, giving the 4 activators a staggered set-up.
A connector may only move within, to, or from a tile with an activator.
There is no capture, but put-backs of opponent's pieces are allowed.

The shortest path across the board is 7 squares.

**************************
That didn't work out, so I continued with a couple more iterations. The first couple follow:

My first attempt allowed players to move 3 pieces/turn, while putting one of the opponent's pieces back to any start square or, if activator, back to one of the 4 back row tiles. This didn't work. You can't get anywhere. White's initial move is 1 less than the allowed moves/turn for the rest of the game.

The current iteration to be tested allows 4 moves/turn, with the option of one of those moves being a put-back of an opponent piece. Or the player may move 4 friendly pieces. Activators must be moved back first, thus protecting all friendly connectors in that tile. A maximum of 2 connectors may be moved sideways in any given turn. Each player may use all 4 activators to activate friendly pieces. I am leaning toward allowing a player to move a back-rank opponent piece sideways to another open back rank square. Originally, the put-back was always the first move a player made, but now a put-back is optional and may be done with any of the 4 moves/turn. 

*************************** 
They didn't work either, and left me with a bigger problem, the loss of a major component of the design:

Ran into an annoying problem with pAth - it doesn't seem to like the "putback" of an opponent's piece during your turn. So I simplified it a bit, and demonstrated one could actually win the game, or at least have an opportunity to do so in a reasonable amount of time. But no "putbacks". A beautiful idea/mechanism, ruined by reality.

Currently, the game has 16 pieces/side, including 4 activators. The activators may step 1 square in any direction. The non-activators may step one square orthogonally forward or sideways. Players may only use their own activators for movement. White starts with 2 moves, then each player may move 3 of his/her own pieces. *** Note, the activators are now used on the "little" squares and also act as connectors - they may be part of a connection from your back row to your opponent's back row.

*************************
I cannot let this stand. I want activators and putbacks and wins in a reasonable number of moves - it's only 7 squares from one side to the other! There <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be a solution to this that gives a decent game - and I suspect there are a class of them you can get to by varying the parameters of the game.

I believe that simply changing the movement of the connectors to a straight line move of 1 to 2 or 3 squares orthogonally, instead of the original 1 square move, should be the key to balancing the "putback" move's excessive power. And I'm inclined to try this with the original rules which treated activators and connectors as totally different pieces. My next post will give the updated rules. I welcome comment or constructive criticism.
