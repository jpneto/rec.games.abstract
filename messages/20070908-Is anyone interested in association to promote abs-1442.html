I am putting feelers out. I was curious to see what the interest
would be to start an association to promote abstract strategy games,
that are done up in the likes of Zillions or Super Duper Games or
Boardspace?

Anyone here interested? Could get a discussion forum going, have
membership, and a championship at Origins or some other location.
Anyone here interested in this? Abstract strategy games are treated
as second-class citizens in the area of boardgames and I would like to
help combat that some, if possible.

I figure one thing that could be done is to have a world abstract
strategy champion who is the top player at two player abstract
strategy games in general. Also bring in the AI development community
also.

Comments?
