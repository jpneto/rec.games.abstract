<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Another<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> fascinating sub-topic! I was vaguely aware of this, so
I just did a web search.  What I find most interesting is that,
despite a lot of disagreement about this, the writing is much
clearer and the points made with far better logic that what I
just saw searching on checkers rules. I suspect that Go attracts
people with more analytical temperaments.

I just learned something about Go that is very relevant to the subject
of this thread.

A while back, in rec.games.go, I noted that the old Korean version of
Go required that the first player put the first stone in the center of
the board. I suggested that imposing or removing this restriction
might be a way to provide a half-stone handicap.

Someone replied that since <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is used in Go, one could simply
vary those points to have handicaps in units of 1/6th of a stone.

Many books referring to Go have noted that unlike the occasionally-
used practice of giving Pawn odds or Knight odds, Go allows a finely-
graded system of handicaps between players.

In comparison, one seldom sees <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> cited as an advantage that
Go has over Chess. But from what I've just learned, it ought to be
cited as one, and a big one.

When komi were first introduced, the advantage that Black had by
placing the first stone in a game without odds was large enough that
the Black player could, through defensive play, almost always ensure
himself of a win by 2 or 3 stones at the end of the game. Adding a
certain amount to White's score - at first as little as 2 1/2 points,
today, as much as 7 1/2 points - meant that the player with the first
move could no longer simply coast with defensive play, but instead
both players, if they wanted to win, would have to play aggressively
and take risks.

If the starting conditions for Chess make a finely-graded system of
handicaps at the beginning difficult, the victory condition,
checkmate, makes something like <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> impossible. It would seem
unlikely that the changes that <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> be made to Chess to balance out
White's first move advantage would have the clear-cut positive results
that <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>komidashi<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> have had for Go.

For example, White could be denied pawn-two for his first move, or
Black could be allowed to win by forcing stalemate. But I doubt that
either measure would have the desired effect. The pawn-one openings
are too viable for White, and stalemate comes up as an issue too
rarely.

If one allowed only Black to win by <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>bare King<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, however, this might
be a large enough change to force White to play aggressively. But to
win by bare King requires a small advantage, whereas komi actually
turns a slight loss into a win.
