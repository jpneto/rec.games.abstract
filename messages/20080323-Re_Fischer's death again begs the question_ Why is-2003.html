<br>No.&nbsp; The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is biased toward White, at least as currently played.

<br>Yes but he still has to play somebody in every round.&nbsp; (Or every round
<br>but one if there's an odd number of players.)

<br>It was Andy May, as you could readily have established by looking at

<br>Mig Greengard and Joel Benjamin aren't `random folks' -- they're
<br>experts in the field.&nbsp; I provided the URLs for their comments
<br>precisely so that you could evaluate their arguments for yourself but,
<br>rather than doing that, you just dismiss them.&nbsp; Here are the URLs
<br>again.

<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>BTW, how does dreaming up ludicrous cheating scenarios help create

<br></blockquote>
<br>It is, as I have pointed out before, unreasonably of you to suggest
<br>that I am in some way deficient for failing to provide statistical
<br>evidence of the effect of something that has never been tried.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I never requested statistical evidence. But the fact that you
<br>haven't provided <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> evidence is telling.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Oh, for crying out loud.&nbsp; It's telling of the fact that this is an
<br>untried idea.&nbsp; I cannot possibly produce any concrete evidence.&nbsp; Just
<br>as you cannot produce any concrete evidence against the hypothesis
<br>that the first words spoken from Mars will be `Damn, but I fancy a
<br>bacon sandwich.'
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I suspect that you really are not so disconnected from reality as to
<br>believe your argument.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Really, you could try to make your insults a little more subtle.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>You have proposed a change to the laws of chess.&nbsp; I have suggested
<br>that this change has flaws.&nbsp; You accuse me of irrationality and
<br>fear of change rather than substantively rebutting what I am
<br>saying.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I have not proposed changes to the laws of chess, but to scoring
<br>which is external to the game itself.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Very well.&nbsp; You have proposed a change to the way in which chess
<br>tournaments are conducted which, incidentally, changes the default
<br>situation of Article 11.1 of the FIDE Laws of Chess, which states,
<br>``Unless announced otherwise in advance, a player who wins his game,
<br>or wins by forfeit, scores one point (1), a player who loses his game,
<br>or forfeits scores no points (0) and a player who draws his game
<br>scores a half point (1/2).''&nbsp; I have suggested specific flaws in this
<br>change.&nbsp; You accuse me of irrationality, fear of change, being
<br>``ludicrous'' and ``disconnected from reality'' rather than
<br>substantively rebutting what I am saying.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>I would rather see [...] chess played under a mathematically sounder
<br>alternate scoring system.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Please justify your assertion that awarding less than half a point
<br>for a draw is mathematically more sound.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I suppose it is not pure mathematics
<br></blockquote>
<br>It is not any kind of mathematics at all.&nbsp; You just wrote `mathema-
<br>tically more sound' because it sounds better than `Well, I like it
<br>better.'
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>but empirically the half point draw has produced a situation where
<br>contestants routinely avoid playing real games.
<br></blockquote>
<br>No.&nbsp; Empirically, the half-point draw has coincided with a situation
<br>where contestants occasionally avoid playing real games.
<br>
<br>I have nothing further to say to you on this subject or any other.
