I will look over Parlett's book if I can.  The categories were based
off of the way Zillions site categorizes it.  The reason for the
categorization is mostly for tournament play.  It is useful for
determining champions of classes of games, but also if you wanted to
have a range of games, Athlons, then you want a representative game of
each type.

That seems like a pretty good reason for the "why", but moving on to the
"what", I'd further question the degree of detail.  The definition of
the NULL non-board area, for example, seems a bit like more information
than needed.  Can you envisage having a tournament class of "Games with
multiple queue NULL features", for example?  If you can, then fine, but
if not it's just something to put people off... "I just wanted to play
checkers, and this leaflet goes on about all kinds of weird shit I've
never heard of, I think these guys are way beyond my league, best leave
'em to it!"
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The classification for the tournaments isn't around stuff like NULL,
it is around the division of games.  Also, if someone wants to play
checkers, there is checker tournaments, and IAGO will be also involved
with some vanilla checker tournaments, with adjustments to perhaps how
the scoring per match works, and also how the clock works.  If you are
referring to the Tournament set, the main selling point is that it is
a place where you can not only get Chess and Checkers, but other noted
top abstracts.  Besides this, there are additional games in there to
to check out, if you like.

Also, the idea of the names is to give better
sounding names for people who play tournaments for games.  For
example, the chess variants site, is having a chess variants
championship.  Calling such games "Royal Elimination" sounds better
and more professional and serious than calling them "Chess Variants".
Doing this helps to get recognition.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Though OTOH it may obfuscate recognition.  Tell me "chess variants" and
I know what you're talking about.  Tell me there's a "Royal Elimination"
tournament and I'll have to get into the small print to know what on
earth is going on, but lots of folk never get into the small print.

If people see the categorization, it doesn't.  There is a category
"Elimination" games.  "Multi-Elimination" is games involving
elimination or neutralizing all pieces of your opponent (or most).
Royal refers to a class of pieces, and thus "Royal Elimination" are
games like chess.  Check the categorization again there.  There are
"Escape", "Territory" and also "Position" games to.  For Backgammon,
there is "Fortuna".

Tell the average person "Chess variants" and they usually think that
you are playing knock-offs of chess.  Also, chess variants doesn't
cover the likes of Shogi or Chinese Chess, which are NOT variants on
chess, but both games that derived from an Indian game that all chess
games are based on.  I would like to see someone be required to master
a bunch of these games in this family, and can do an Athlon for them
in the form of a "Classic Royal Elimination" tournament.

Would you rather the categorization of the games be called: "Chatrang
Variants"?  Considering chess and the others are probably derived from
it, it would make possible sense.  But I dare you to stick Chinese
Chess in a category called "Chess Variants".  That is an insult to
people from China.
