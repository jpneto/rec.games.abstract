Hey, thanks Nick. I'm not sure I can explain how its draw-free since I'm not entirely sure what suggests to you draws are possible. Basically the only way a player wouldn't have a move is if all of his groups had no liberties and that would mean every stone within them would qualify as dead. Luis helpfully pointed out that with passing strictly prohibited a draw was possible. However this is only if an especially nasty player were to trap his opponent's groups and then proceed to toy with him by not removing the trapped groups. Even though this situation is absurd for the sake of consistency I decided to make use of the Othello protocol as I did with Slither and Ki. That is you automatically forfeit your turn if you don't have a legal move. So the game is most assuredly draw-free.
