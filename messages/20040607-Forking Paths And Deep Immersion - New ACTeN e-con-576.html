Stories pervade the fabric of our lives, run through our minds and reside in
our hearts.
The art of story telling is one of the oldest methods of human communication
and has a
history as long as the history of the mankind. From the first stone tablets
carrying the
epic of King Gilgamesh to contemporary theatre, television and computer
games, stories
have helped us understand the world, ourselves and others.

Interactive media have eased the production process for making multimedia
stories and
increased the opportunities for people telling their stories. Also, the
Internet has opened
undreamt-of-possibilities to distribute stories to a worldwide audience.

"Online Storytelling" the 5th ACTeN e-content report examines the
possibilities of advanced
storytelling techniques in modern online communication. Author Katarina
Bjï¿½rk from Story Lab
illustrates the art of storytelling from interactive classics like Dungeons
&amp; Dragons (1974)
to the use of storytelling techniques in advanced advertising, branding and
political campaigns.

"Online Storytelling" contains a useful overview on "best-practice" in new
ways of telling stories.
Exemplary projects, websites and communication campaigns which apply
story-telling to spread
their message are presented.
