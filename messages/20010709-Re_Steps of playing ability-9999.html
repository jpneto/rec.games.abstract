: I heard rumors about go having ca. 40 steps, chess and other games only 12.

The ranking system of go has indeed about 40 steps, but whether or not a
difference of one level corresponds to 75% winning chance can be
disputed. For example, personal playing styles of different players may
match or mismatch so that A probably wins B, B probably
wins C and C probably wins A. 

I've never liked the idea of classifying the complexity of games by a
mere winning probability. It is too one-dimensional. A better estimate
would be a number of times a player must completely change the way of
thinking when one develops from a beginner to a master. Another
possibility would be measuring the amount and abstractness of new concepts
one needs for thinking and speaking about the strategies of the game. This
could be approximated by the number of technical words there are for
describing different tactical and strategical situations (and in
particular such words that are not needed for describing the rules.)

I assume that in this aspect the two most complex games are go (having a
huge vocabulary for different shapes ((shimari, empty triangle etc..)), 
move sequences ((ladder, taisha joseki etc...)), and fuzzy
whole-board configurations ((thickness, moyo etc...)) )  and bridge,
with a huge vocabulary for different bids and conventions.
