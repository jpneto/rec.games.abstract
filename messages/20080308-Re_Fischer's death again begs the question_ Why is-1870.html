When the Madden series of videogames came out, it was the first really
popular game that got all the rules of football right, so an entire
generation raised on videogames can watch a football broadcast and
understand everything that's happening. Football viewership has been
steadily increasing, especially among that young age bracket.

The Madden factor did slip under my radar, because there are plenty of
chess games out there. Programmers thought that they could create
artificial intelligence once they created computers that could beat
the world's grandmasters, but all they achieved was brute force
algorhythm solving, much like the first calculator faster than a man
on an abacus.

What is sorely needed is a program that can lose like a human would.
Humans can be motivated by greedy pawn grabbing, ambitious early Queen
moves, and an amateur noted by how they try to develop a rook with a P-
R4. Every mistake I've seen a novice setting make has been a blunder
no below average person would make. Yet even masters can fall into
traps that alorhythms would be smart enough to avoid.
