Christian's game lo was actually released in 2014, but he's still leading the pack.  I'm pretty sure I influenced Christian's design philosophy.  He used to argue vehemently with me against the value of drawless games.  Now that's all he designs.  You're welcome.

Actually Knightfall came in 2015 after a embarrassingly deplorable invention process. I hope it yet resulted in a nice quickie to get kids interested in abstracts. 

I never argued against drawlessness. Rather I argued for the value of some games that can end in a draw. Now lately I mainly play Pit of Pillars. I'm not a star in deductive reasoning so I can't prove whether it can end in a draw or not. I can't see it happen, but that's not much of an argument. For a fact: it didn't happen yet and I don't care either way. 

Pylyx, Multiplicity and Medea can all end in a draw. It doesn't bother the games and it doesn't bother me.
