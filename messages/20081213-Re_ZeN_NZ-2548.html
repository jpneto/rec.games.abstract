I didn't suggest playing on the octagons alone -- obvioiusly that's the same
as playing on a square grid to begin with.
I was suggesting that in a game between rational players, evenly matched or
not, no one will ever play a square unless they are forced to and the
decision will always be trivial.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ok, but I still don't believe it.  Remembering playing various
connection games against vastly superior players, there were always
odd, seemingly inferior moves that didn't make sense until it was too
late.  If you pitted two advanced players against each other and one
could play any cells at any time (on a 4.8.8) and the other could only
make trivial square moves, the former would undoubtedly win.

Can you find an example that illustrates your position?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No.  Anything other than a trivial move is an advanced move for me.
There's not a lot of middle ground there for me.  But there's no doubt
in my mind that an advanced player would take the occasional square,
seemingly isolated from the rest of the claimed cells, but which would
magically come in very handy much later when it was needed.

The FCFC represents an aesthetic problem for me.  It makes the
connections dependent upon the order in which the squares are
claimed.  I don't like that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't understand the objection.

  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |
 \   / \   /
  --- x ---
 /   \ /   \
|  o  |  x  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---

Though X has the square because he played to both octagons first, players
don't have to remember who played where first.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I know, I'm not saying they have to.  But on a 4.8.8 the five squares
can be claimed at any time by any player in any order.  You don't have
that with FCFC.  So for example you can fill up the board with black
and white stones completely at random, with no consideration for which
cells were claimed in which order, and have what I consider to be a
"true" win loss compatible game.  That matters from an aesthetic
perspective.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There are no 'dependent'
connections -- playing the second X MADE the connection, blocking future
connections.

But in the end, I think that the rule differences matter so little that we
could play the game EACH USING OUR OWN RULES!

It doesn't matter to me.  I'm always going to lose unless playing
someone more awful than me.  Doesn't happen too often.

So far, I've found games on 4+ valent grids much more difficult to fathom
than hex. You need a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more space to block. I'm not great at Hex and Y,
