Given the forgiving definition we already use, I don't see why not.

Christian - Any ideas for the next 'abstract theme' contest?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If we want a lot of entries, I'd say a Chess variant (maybe some sub-
theme or mechanism required because the field is almost limitless). Of
course we already drown in Chess variants, but the number is by now so
large that a few extra won't make any difference anymore ;-)

Other than that, maybe a Race/Blockade theme. There are a lot of
mechanisms possible there and the theme is not too difficult.

But my suggestions are as good as the next one.

Hey Christian, I've already got the race theme chess variant contest
won! ;)  Check out "Breakthrough Chess" (possibly under its old name
of "Advancing Chess") on the ZOG site.  Actually, I know that old
games are not valid entries, and I also realize that Parton's "Racing
Kings" sets the bar quite high.  I'm just pleased to see the genre in
which I had already worked mentioned as possibly contest worthy.

As far as who gets to vote, my concern is controlling multiple
voting.  If anyone can show up here and vote, what's to stop
individuals from coming here using multiple pseudonyms and voting
repeatedly?  I trust the designers would have enough integrity not to
do that, but who can speak for the fanbois?  I think my long time
record of participation in abstract games, and also being an inventor,
although not of a game in the contest, makes me qualified to vote
impartially (and yes, despite my negative relationship with Corey, I
highly respect Particle Bond and would objectively evaluate anything
he entered), but I would also accept a more strict process of limiting
voting.
