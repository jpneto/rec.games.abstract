Go is really, really difficult, but it can be fun to try. Playing Go
without any feedback from someone who played Go before is probably not
to recommend. However, I think it is a game you should have a taste of.

It is true that Go is a game which is difficult to get into without
the guidance of other Go players. It is also true to say that it takes
are great deal of study to become an expert at it. However, you don't
need to be an expert to enjoy it, and I don't think it's accurate to
describe Go as "really really difficult" to actually play.

I learnt to play Go from a work colleague who brought a set into the
office and we played during the lunch hour. It took ten minutes to
explain the rules with a few simple examples, and immediately I was
fascinated by the seemingly random scatterings of stones which somehow
worked together to form connected defendable territories.

By the end of the lunch hour I was starting to understand how to form
"living" groups, and the basic idea of Ko fights. Within a week of
lunches, I knew how to play, albeit at a very novice level. I then
started going along to a local Go club and I've never looked back.

Please don't be put off by people saying Go is difficult. I find it
easier than chess whilst at the same time being much deeper and
therefore more interesting. Go is a hugely rewarding game once you
have got over the initial hurdle of learning the basic ideas.

I am an experienced Go player who taught lots of Go beginners and played
at many European tournamts. I doubt that you ever will find out about
the beauties of Go or even get a faint understanding of this game
without being introduced its secrets by a strong Go player. The game is
really worth your time.

I totally agree. Go is beautiful and fascinating at so many levels, and
yet so subtle that you cannot hope to appreciate its beauty unless you
spend some time learning from a stronger player. I recommend that you
join a local Go club rather than trying to appreciate what Go is like
by yourself.

The British Go Association has an excellent site at:
&lt;URL: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.britgo.org/">http://www.britgo.org/</a>&gt;
and there is a good introduction to the game if you follow
the link to "About the game of Go".

There is also an American Go Association: &lt;URL: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.usgo.org/">http://www.usgo.org/</a>&gt;

And if that is not sufficient there are loads of Go links here:
