I don't think I need to "earn" anything at this point, Bill - least of
all bragging rights.  If you can't concede the collective significance

If you think of game-playing as a kind of social ritual, games that no
one plays don't really exist.  They're just ideas floating out there
in the in ether.  Games that very few people play aren't worth much,
even if, as ideas, they are nice to behold.  A ruleset is like a seed:
basically pointless unless it becomes a tree.  I think that none of
us, including you, Mark, has made any real contribution to the world
of games, yet.  Maybe someday though.
