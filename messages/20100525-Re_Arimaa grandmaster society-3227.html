fizzy,

No, that wasn't the rule that was changed, but that's a good guess.

"Originally Arimaa was drawn if all sixteen rabbits were captured, but
on July 1, 2008, Syed changed the rules of Arimaa to eliminate the
possibility of draws. This change was essentially cosmetic, as there
had never been a draw in thousands of human games anyway.",

I don't have statistics about how often the 'superko' like rule comes
into effect.  I could only guess.  Generally, the rule favors the
aggressor, so it tends to drive the game to completion more quickly -
when it's necessary - but in a significant majority of the games I've
observed it is rarely needed - but again I have no statistics - my
observations of the game are that Arimaa might depend on that rule
about as much as Go does. It's just one of those things you're aware
of, and the game just flows naturally.


Mark,

Again...  Facts?  I've asked for facts, but I saw nothing of substance
in your last post.  I've given you links to the data in my previous
post.
