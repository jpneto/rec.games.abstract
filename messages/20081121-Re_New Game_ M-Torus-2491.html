As I wrote to Mark privately, there are these points:-

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
However, with all due respect, this is pretty much the same as
my "Projex", which has been on Richard's server for some time,
and published on the net also for some time.

You have constructed a variant where the local topology
is hexagonal, and the global topology is quadrilateral,
which is kind of interesting mathematically,
but probably not the best for actual play.

It is more usual to keep the same for both local &amp; global
aspects; either both hexly as in Projex or both quadly
as in our Quadrex/Crossway collection of variants.

Two technical points you may observe....

First, it is NOT a torus, it is a projective plane;
 (you should alter this!  Before some other nitpicker... oops!)

2nd; your two border cells labelled 1 and 7 are not full cells,
     but only half-cells.  I presume this is what you were
     trying to suggest by giving them tiny numbers on the pic,
     but it would be good to note it outright.

This is exactly parallel to Projex's six 5/6-cells !

Still, it's a nice variant.
