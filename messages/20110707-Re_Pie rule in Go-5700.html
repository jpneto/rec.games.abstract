Disclaimer: I'm a total non-Go player.  I don't like to play Go, and I have
no desire to brainwash myself into liking it.  Go makes for an interesting
topic of discussion though.

Yes, the pie rule would be considerably less artificial.  With komi, White
gets his ass kicked for a couple hours and totally loses.  Then he gets to
sit there counting stones like a jackass and, whadya know, he just scraped
by with enough points to win on paper.  Whoop-de-fuckin-do.  I don't want to
win on paper.  I want to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>win<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

Komi is ugly.  Or, more specifically, unbalance in a game is ugly.  Imagine
a gladiator with a club fighting a gladiator with nothing.  The one with the
club says "I'd have a lot more interesting possibilities to explore if I had
a club <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a shield."  (That would be Christian Freeling's ancestor.)

The pie rule and komi are not mutually exclusive, and what's best for Go may
be a combination of both of them.

"Move restriction", as you call it, would really just be a restriction on
the first move of a game of potentially hundreds of moves. If the Go game
tree is as astronomical as legend has it, there'd still be a lot of game
tree left over after the pruning.  Not like the non-robust Chess that's
already too weak to support expert play, and whose game tree certainly
couldn't withstand any sort of pruning.

My guess about the effect of the pie rule in Go is that it woould't be
enough by itself to create a fair game.  It would dramatically reduce the
komi, cutting it in half maybe, but every starting board point would still
be worth either a couple of score points for Black or a couple of score
points for White.  No starting board points would be worth zero score
points.
