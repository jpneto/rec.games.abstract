I don't understand that.

Redstone has a more tactical orientation around handling liberties and eyespace on individual groups. As a result, you could play on 67x67 if you wanted to, but I don't think the strategic depth would increase much beyond 15x15. The same has happened in Go, which I suspect is strategically deeper than redstone because of less emphasis on tactical intricacies, and there is some professional debate about 19x19 or 21x21, but the general belief at the moment is that 19x19 is optimal. I think the tactical subtleties in Redstone would make the optimal size a bit smaller.

Ultimately a sophisticated balancing mechanism may be recommended for
Redstone.  Starting out though, since almost nothing is known about Redstone
relative to Go, let's use something as simple as pie - or simpler.  Just
insist that Black make his first move at (2,2), and take it from there.

I think that would be a detriment to both the strategic interest of the opening, and to the appeal of the game as a whole, let alone being simply rather abitrary and odd as a rule :P
