Hmm, what about generalizing Hex to higher dimensions?

   * 0-D tokens, 1-D goals, 2-D board = Hex
   * 1-D tokens, 2-D goals, 3-D board = ?

I've spent a fair amount of time messing around with 3D shapes such as
the surface of a cylinder and a torus and so forth.  I keep running
into this problem that you have to win a hex-like confrontation in two
different locations in order to win.  So if you win one of the
confrontations and lose the other one, neither player makes it
through.  There's also the problem that both players can make it
through by going around opposite sides of the same 3D shape.

I created a game, Box Hex, a couple years ago, which does work.  It
can be argued that it's not really a 3D shape but rather a morphed 2D
shape.  To me it seems like an essentially 3D shape because if you
want to have a regular hexagonal tessellation all over it (except for
the pentagonal cells in the corners) it has to be 3D.  But you can see
the arguments on both sides.  The fact that it is a morph of a 2D
board is probably what makes it succeed.

I no longer have Box Hex on my website because it's nothing real
special IMO, but here's a link:
