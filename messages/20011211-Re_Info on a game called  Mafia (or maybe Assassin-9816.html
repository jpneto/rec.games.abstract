You need at least 8 players (10-12 is ideal).
One person is the moderator.  While everyone closes their eyes, the
moderator selects two mafia members, one sheriff, and one guardian
angel.  Everyone else is just a townsperson.  You know who you are,
but not who anyone else is.  Each round starts with everyone closing
thier eyes.  The mafia then open their eyes and silently agree on
someone to kill.  the sheriff then opens his eyes and has one chance
to finger a mafia member.  The moderator will nod yes or no.  The
guardian angel then wakes up and has one chance to 'save' someone he
thinks might have been killed.  Then everyone wakes up, the moderator
announces who was killed (or saved), and the accusations fly. 
Townspeople can vote off suspected mafia members, but they may end up
voting off their own kind.  If both mafia members are voted off the
townspeople win, if the mafia manage to last until the end of the game
they win.

I learned the game as "Werewolf" as well.  An interesting exercise is
to figure out how you can play the game without any moderation.  This
means that dead players leave the room (or observe without comment).

Hint: Use the cards.

I see dead links.  They don't know they're dead.  I see them all the time.
