This sentence is tautological and makes no sense to me.



"Macau is a remarkably fair game.  During testing, in which Macau was played hundreds of times, there was no detectable statistical advantage (or disadvantage) in being the first to take a turn."

No need for the pie rule - something Christian Freeling falsely claim about Sygo in an endless cycle of waffling, backpedaling, retracting, and reasserting.  Now I've actually achieved it with Macau.  No matter how "small" the game is, i.e., even with a set size of one, and a couple of moves per game, there's no turn order advantage.  

Guess we won't be hearing from Christian for a while.  He's taking a much needed break in the hills - behind the trembling bush.
