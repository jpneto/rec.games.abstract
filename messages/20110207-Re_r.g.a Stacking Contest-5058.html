I suggested no such thing, just missed the post. March 20th is all
right with me.

Not to speak for Gamerman, but I believe this statistic was based on his

I've played more Monkey Queen than anybody at this point, and the current
balancing mechanism, the pie rule, is more than adequate to balance the game
for the current range of skill levels.  What determines the winner in Monkey
Queen is the ability to detect checkmate opportunities and effective
follow-through, not who moved first.  Gamerman beats me every time
regardless of who goes first, regardless of whether the pie rule is in
effect, and I'm quite certain, regardless of any new balancing mechanism we
might try - simply because he's a more skilled player.

That's what made me wonder about where he got his stats in the first
place. MQ needs more than a few games to get to any reliable stats.
Yet saying that the first move advantage is inconsequential seems to
me to be stretching it a bit. At the current level you may be right.
But that's not where you want the game to remain ;-)
