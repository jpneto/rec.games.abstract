It would be an intriguing game-design challemge (HELLO NICK!),

in view of the remarks above, but there seems no a priori problem.

How about this:

Each player has a number of circular disks of their colour and take
turns placing disks inside a large circle.  Disks can touch, but not
overlap.  Disks can be played so they overlap the perimeter of the
large circle, but the center of a disk must be inside the circle.  The
first player to connect two parts of the circle-edge that are more
than 100 degrees apart with a path of touching disks wins.

I can't say if this will ensure a winner on "filled" board (one where
no more disks can be played), but paths certainly can't overlap.
