Hi,



Here is maybe the simpliest game ever with one rule.

Mirroring the play is not alllowed unless the game will not be a game.

If you are programmer implement it.

The scoring board will be on real-time.



Enjoy!

Sorry for the mistake of the board polygon 6-sided instead of 5-sided.
You can use in fact any board (assymettric or symettric of any form containing all the kinds of polygons circular elliptic  etc...) as long as you 64 sections.
Which board is optimal? I still do not know because there are almost an infinite number of board.
The game is easy to play for kids too even if it is not specially designed for them.
By having the scores on real time players knnow where they are going.
Yesterday I was in hurry to send the game because of my health problems. I took of one my boards ( I have some sort of little database of boards in my computer) it was the wrong one.
Sorry!
