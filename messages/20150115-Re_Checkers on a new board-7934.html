Played 3 games using something like Anglo-American Checkers rules, with the king's row consisting of only the furthest two points. It also seemed most simple and natural but a little counter-intuitive to allow kings to jump boomerang-style over a piece forward from them but landing on a space level or behind them. Basically kings could jump to any empty point connecting to the location of the opponent's piece, while men could only capture forward.. In other words, I played with "forwards" and "backwards" being the only relevant classifications for move legality, rather than trying to incorporate the diverse angles of the connections between spaces to determine proper destination spaces following capture. Hope that isn't too confusing. 

Playing with a rule such as "the unoccupied space behind a piece to be captured must be in roughly the same compass quadrant as said piece" worked fine and felt more like vanilla Checkers, but I know that if I read that in the rules my impression would be "oh, well isn't this a strained and contrived checkers variant! I think I'll pass." The less restrictive rules I used resulted in an extremely compelling game! I'll play more and maybe post some more notes about specifics but I must at least make a good faith effort to study right now. Thanks again for your post.
