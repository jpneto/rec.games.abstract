Jeez, don't make it sound so villainous  :D  As I recall, you were balking
at idiocy on the Arimaa forum and needed a little room to spread out. 
You're welcome.  :)  That being said, I'm glad you came to
rec.games.abstract.  I (now correctly) intuited that you'd do more good than
harm here.

Then I was invited
[to fake newsgroup, recre.games.combinatorial],
... with people being "excited about the prospect
of thoughtful, non-hyperbolic, troll- free
discussion".

Some discussion.

Oooh, OUCH!  In the previous episode, Corey Clark's "we" had been beaten,
raped, and left for dead.  Now it was last seen being dragged by a chain
behind a pickup truck through a dry creek bed.

...nobody has anything to contribute? Not even a
decent answer about a particularly incomprehensible
statement and an argument to match?

Bill, Christian has asked you to explain your game related comment **in a
discussion that YOU initiated** at least five times already, and he's asked
you in the most pleasant manner possible.  Not a hint of bile.  Why are you
selectively ignoring the only valid, game related question before us right
now, and instead focusing on the bile that you purportedly detest??

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Bill, if you post this at r.g.a.:

More to the point, they're all gamerelated.
All the posts here are now bile-related.
I wonder how that came about....

thereby ignoring my post on the state of affairs concerning Havannah
programs and the 2012 challenge, then you're ignoring a fact because
it doesn't fit your conclusion.

What's that called in plain English?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I call it a low-road, diversionary tactic, rather typical of Bill Taylor. 
He's been doing it to me for five years.  The moment you try to start a
legitimate discussion, like announcing a new game, Taylor hops into action
with a diversion.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I came here to discuss games, but there seems to
be a division between artists and art experts. You,
Bill, are an 'art expert' who came by way of being
a failed artist. You know everything about inventing
games, except how to do it.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Bravo, Christian.  Bravo.  I'm sorry I ever doubted you.  You have vastly
exceeded my expectations.  I just wanted you to help clean up the mess left
behind by Bill Taylor.  He was pretty much gone from the group already.  It
was like a perfect storm or something with you arriving and then Bill Taylor
returning at about the same time.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
On top of that you're dishonest and resentful.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You feel at home cheering up the masses with your
perceived authority, be it a dog pack or a lynch mob.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly.  Billy the bully has been abusing his professorial cache here for
years.  But he now seems to have gotten his fat tit in a wringer with his
colleagues.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
All the while your civility and politeness is
overflowing.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's really the most fucked up thing in all of this.

Bill Taylor: "Run from Mark the Destroyer to my group!"
Bill Taylor: "Whew! Finally, a haven of civility!"
Bill Taylor: "Freeling, did you know your game is ugly?"
