On September 23rd 1994 I received my Ph.D. after defending the
thesis "Searching for Solutions in Games and Artificial Intelligence".

In the thesis, thinking games are investigated from the perspective of
research in Artificial Intelligence.
In the introduction (chapter 1) the relevance of such investigations is
discussed. Then, two new search techniques, proof-number search (chapter 2)
and dependency-based search (chapter 3) are described, which have been
developed while solving the games connect-four, qubic and go-moku.
The solutions to the last two of these games are described in
chapters 4 and 5.
Finally, the complexity and state-of-the-art in computer game playing
is described for each of the games in the so-called Olympic List of 15
well-known games, leading to a prediction for the future of games
(chapter 6).

The thesis consists of 223 pages, including preliminary, summary,
bibliography and index.

Anyone interested can obtain the thesis in three different ways.

1. FTP: 	ftp.cs.vu.nl
		pub/victor/PhDthesis/thesis.ps.Z

   Here it is both possible to obtain individual parts of the thesis,
   as well as obtaining it as a whole. Just check the contents
   of the directory pub/victor/PhDthesis.

2. World Wide Web:
		<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~victor/thesis.html">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~victor/thesis.html</a>

   Here it is both possible to obtain individual parts of the thesis,
   as well as obtaining it as a whole.

3. The thesis can also be obtained in book form.
   I had 400 copies of it printed at 17x24 cm, with a nice cover design,
   see the above page at World Wide Web for a picture of the thesis) of
   which I have some 50 copies left to sell.

   Anyone who would like to obtain the book, can order one by
   sending 20 dollar US in CASH (or the equivalent in any other
   foreign currency) in an envelope to:

	Victor Allis
	Department of Computer Science
	Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science
	Vrije Universiteit
	De Boelelaan 1081 
	1081 HV Amsterdam
	The Netherlands

   Upon receiving the money, I will send a copy of the thesis to you. Make
   sure to clearly indicate your postal address.

   I do not accept checks of any form, since the bank fees involved
   in cashing a check are approximately $US 10 on both sides, which
   means that you would need to add another $US 20.

I hope you enjoy reading the thesis.

Victor Allis.
