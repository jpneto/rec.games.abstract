ok... rules as I understand them.

I'll try to help you word it in english for the layman :)



Setup: 

On a 6x6 board write the numbers 1-6 six times randomly.  One number in each square.

The game is scalable so if it were an 8x8 board then one would use the numbers 1-8 etc...

In other words: on an n x n board randomly designate each number 1 - n to each square n times.



Play:

Mark any number somehow (we circled them).  The next player then scratches out numbers adjacent to the marked number and/or other numbers scratched out during that turn.



If a player has no legal move for either part of their turn (marking or scratching) they lose.



Note on tactics:

if someone circles a 4 or higher one unscratched or marked space away from the edge they risk instantly losing.

if someone circles a 2 or higher one unscratched or marked space diagonally adjacent to a corner square they also risk instantly losing.



I'd like to play more just to see if it's at all interesting beyond the joy of learning a simple new game.  I'll see if I can convince my wife to play it again.  The setup time is really not too bad.  If you have any more pen and paper abstracts I'd be interested to check'm out.  My 11 yr old daughter and I like to play short games like this while waiting for food at a restaurant or in line etc...  I taught her how to hustle her friends at nim ;)

Correction : The next player then scratches out numbers starting from any non scratched square. Not necessarly the marked one. Only when a player start scratching he has TO respect the adjacency.
In his turn (if we except the first move of the game) a player has to perform 2 actions :
1- Starting from any non scrateched square on the board and creating k connected squares (k is the number of the last scratched square by his opponent)
2- After scratching k squares he can CHOOSE any non scratched square to order his opponent the next "k"

Each time players create "islands" of scratched squares.
Adjacency is ABSOLUTELY required when it comes to creating "island" of scratched squares otherwise ADJACENCY is not required.
Look at the first few moves (I put the color instead of scratching so people can see the numbers).

Thank you for your writing help even if there was an error on rewriting it.

I have others unpublished paper and pens games (maybe 20 or more).
