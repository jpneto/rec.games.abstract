Milk Challenge '95

     The game is simple but nobody has won yet.  A number of contestents
attempts to beat the others in finishing his own personal gallon of milk.
We have had more than eight people try this and fail miserably.

Are you MAN-ENOUGH to take the milk Challenge!  Here Are the RULES!

I.)   1 gallon of 2% or whole milk in 1 hour.
II.)  The contestant is not allowed to take any special lactose tollerance 
III.) pills.If he/she throws up... THEY LOSE!

POINTERS!
1.) The vomit looks better if you do it on a full stomach.
2.) Contestants get REALLY irritable during the 30 minute mark on...
3.) Always have a big (CLEAR) vomit bag.
4.) Make sure to bring lots of friends....

Our big social event had around 30 people watching this guy drink milk..
Now thats a monday night...

Following this letter should be the offical 320x200 256 colour Milk
