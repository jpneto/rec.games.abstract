I somehow doubt this. For my part I certainly wont agree to any sort of armistice. The polemics of Mark Steere, an actual designer, are something I can deal with. If Mark started ranting about how bad Connecticut was here, I might even just agree with him. Not only has he created important seminal games, he has prefigured a whole movement within the circle of abstract game enthusiasts based on an appreciation for objective, decisive design. The reason I will defend Connecticut when it is attacked by you is because your criticisms come from a place of poverty. "Do deep Google search, you are not designer, you are patchworker". Patchworker? Me? Nigga, I am one of the few designers with metarules to his credit. That is to say mechanics that didn't exist in any form before I discovered them.

If anything I should be the one hurling accusations of "patchworking". Especially in the case of a douchebag trying to supercollide game perfection like Hex with a Blokus rehash. Here's a question douchebag, how the fuck are people going to put rectilinear pieces on a hexagonal board. Hazen, I cannot even in all good conscience give your mere existence my approbation.
