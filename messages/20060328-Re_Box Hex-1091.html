No, it does not.  I showed the box open end up since that is a more
natural portrayal of an open box, and since it shows that the box is
open.  If the box were illustrated open end down, you wouldn't be able
to see that it was open.  As I said, the box is not intended to be
actually constructed, and so it's really of no import if it's upside
down or rightside up.  It's there for informational purposes to simply
show that Box Hex is played on an open box shape.

|&gt; This is essentially a two-dimensional game. It is equivalent to the

|&gt; Let the blue lines outline the cells which may be played in here.

|I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.

Suppose someone were to independently come up with the pattern of
blue cells I show in the above link. That person might argue that
such a board could be distorted into a box shape as you describe,
but it does not change the essential two-dimensional nature of
the game. How would such reasoning be different from yours?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's ridiculous.  The probability that someone would accidently
design a convoluted board which just happens to be a reverse engineered
morph of an open box shape which has a perfectly uniform hexagonal
pattern (except for six pentagons in the bottom corners) is exactly
zero.

Box Hex is a Hex variant.  It's a regular hexagonl pattern imprinted on
the surface of an open box shape.  I have prepared a two dimensional
representation to make it convenient to setup and play.  Dave Dyer
suggested your idea, with the larger convoluted cells around the
outside before you did.  Now, because you have managed to create yet
another two dimensional representation of a three dimensional board,
suddenly Box Hex is "essentially two dimensional."  In dropping the
third dimension, the image is necessarily distorted and loses some of
its essence.  If you create a two dimensional map of a mountain range,
does that make the mountain range "essentially two dimensional"?

I've said all I have to say on the dimensionality of Box Hex.  This is
getting stupid.  If it makes you feel better to think of Box Hex as
"essentially two dimensional" that's your prerogative.

Your game would certainly be easier to play on a flat grid; you could
use tokens instead of markers, and you could see the whole board at
once.

| ...In both cases, the game maintains the topographic
|characteristics of its original three dimensional shape:  Number one,
|the shortest connection paths are around the outside of the middle
|area, not through the middle area.  Number two, there are four
|shortest paths - two for each player - much different from the one
|shortest connection path you have in regular Hex, a path which is
|shared by both players.

Any winning path for one player in Box Hex, short or long, must share
at least one cell with any winning path for the opponent, short or
long. Do you agree?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, I agree.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

How do you come up with just one shortest winning path in Hex? It
looks to me that an NxN grid would have N shortest winning paths for
each player. Do you agree?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, you are correct.  However more shortest paths go through the
center point on an odd x odd board than any other point.

|No matter how you morph the (three dimensional) box in Box

On this point, we completely agree.

So, are you suggesting the board should be asymmetric? Your Box Hex
board is just as symmetric as the regular Hex board.

|it).

What do you mean by "paramount"? And what does the center have to do
with the shortest connection path?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm getting a little beyond my purview with Hex strategy and the
importance of the center, since, as I've admitted, I've only played Hex
once.  Allow me to quote from a recognized expert, David Boll:

  ") The opening

  If you're the first player, the opening move is easy:  open in the
center
  hex.  The second person has a few semi reasonable choices..."

This is from David's FAQ:

  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mazeworks.com/hex7/hex_faq.html">http://www.mazeworks.com/hex7/hex_faq.html</a>

This I believe is common wisdom among Hex experts.

|I'm not claiming that Box Hex is free of first (or second) move

How does changing the importance of the central

Let me ask you this:  Why do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> think Hex has such a powerful first
move advantage?  Is it because of the "tempo"?  All turn based games
have tempo.  Why would Hex be so bowled over by tempo?

|Thank you for providing these links.  The boards are beautiful to
|behold.  Other variants of Hex have also been brought to my attention.
|So far, Box Hex is the only Hex variant I'm aware of which is
|essentially three dimesional.
|
|&gt;
|&gt; The pie rule is recommended for all these variants.
|&gt;
|
|As with standard Hex, their single shortest paths travel right through
|the center, making the pie rule an immediate necessity, even for
|beginners.

Uh- Mark, did you actually look at that second link? The square Hex
board? The yellow one? It's also on the second page from the first
link. Count the number of cells distance to connect the black border
rows, if you go adjacent to a white border row all the way. Now
count the cell distance if you go through the center.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, you are correct.  I should have looked at that second board more
carefully.  You make a lot of valid and interesting points.  Except the
one about Box Hex being "essentially two dimensional."
