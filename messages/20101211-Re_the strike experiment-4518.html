The obviously untrue one: the one where you say that you don't take life
all that seriously, because the amount of time you have devoted to
insulting two people who just happened to be key members of a group
which ignored one of your posts shows it to be untrue. Whether you are
deluded, or are lying about not taking life too seriously, only you can
know for sure.

But your last question is really loaded, and shows that, whatever your
skills at games may be, critical thinking is not one of your strengths.

The amount of time I have spend 'insulting people' is far less than
the time I wasted on playing against 'Ring of Failure'. But you are
right in that fora are not the place to find inspiration for designing
games. Fortunately I have no burning ambitions in that field. Nor did
I ever need them. I failed at not inventing games, maybe you could
succeed at not writing programs :)
