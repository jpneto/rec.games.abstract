    I haven't seen any official chinese checker rules. Although, I
used to play with a chinese set that came with chinese instructions. If
it's not official, it's at least authentic. 
    I don't have the rules in front of me so I am doing this from memory.
On a move you can either move a piece one step to a neighboring opening,
or make a series of jumps. The source and destination of a jump must
be same distance from a single middle piece of any color. There cannot 
be any piece other then the middle piece along the jump path. Jumps can
be zig-zag'ed from one jump to the other. 
    A piece can 'visit' other players home but can not stay there at the 
end of the turn. i.e., you can jump in and jump out of other player's
home. There is no rule in preventing somebody from staying home and 
make you lose. However, in a 2 player game, that is not a good strategy.
There is also no rule in preventing players from trapping their opponent.
A row of 2 deep can stop a piece from getting out. Hope this help. I
am still interested in hearing some ideas about strategy.
