I went through all the knight moves, and so I understand how you move around on the board(s).  One thing you said is that if you move around in a little square you're still in the same big square.  I get that.  And if you move among big squares you're still in the same little square.  I don't get that.  I'm guessing that's the 4d aspect.  Two or more pieces can mysteriously occupy the same little square in 4D space.  How many pieces can occupy a little square like this?  16? 

This would be easier to understand with more diagrams. With arrows. And before and after diagrams (think Monkey Queen rule sheet).  It seems clear now in retrospect, but expecting people to struggle through an almost entirely textual description of a 4D game is a tall order. 

You gotta get someone to program this for online play.

Sincerely smart people will never play this kind of game.
Only dumb people who to look smart will play Hyperchess4.
What will impress me is not the dimension of any game nor its complexity but its "miniminalist size(board pieces rules etc..) compared to its deep deepness.

Ps : yesterday I was just kidding because when Joe Joyce see that my capture mechanism was already done I was really shocked by his dumbness. Deep deep dumbness.
