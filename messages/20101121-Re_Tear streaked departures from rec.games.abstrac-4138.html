===================================================
To all those great many who have privately replied expressing
support,
offers of help, and disgust at Mark Steere's despicable (but
laughable)
attempts to get me into trouble, MANY THANKS.
Your good wishes are very welcome.  You will also be pleased to hear
that
Mark's complaints have been investigated and found to be baseless, and
that
I have been declared free of blame.  As I predicted, he has confirmed
his
status as a vicious crackpot.  His penchant for posting private emails
to
him, on the net, has also been noted.
You could further show support, by cut-&amp;-pasting and reposting my
message
about the new group, every so often,
say once a fortnight, a different person each time, so bilious Mark
can't
really make a personal attack on you
via whatever server you have.
Many thanks once again, your messages sing out hope for Usenet after
all!
Bill
===================================================

How the fuck is this a goodbye? It seems more like a "nice try" to
me...
