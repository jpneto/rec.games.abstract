     Hello, my friends...

       I have long been a fan of Ataxx; for some reason I just liked the
"flavor" of the game.  Other development notes include Ataxx tm the arcade
game, marketed by the LeLand Corp., as well as home versions by Larry
Kepko and others.  Other versions, called Chello and Caesar are out there,
with identical play but different names.  

          The Arcade version had a neat feature: it included a rating
system, and its different levels had ratings.  Thus, it was possible to
get a rating for yourself, similar to the Chess ratings used by the USCF. 


           It also had different "personalities" in the different levels. 
 
In brief order of ascending difficulty, they are: 
"Colony": played great one-move ideas, but utterly failed to follow up.
"Droolman": played decently, but with little aggression or inspiration.
"Mushman": Some insane/beserk hyper aggressive set of ideas which involved
many jumps and outflanking the opponent.  When it workes, I don't
understand.  Other times, "he" couldn't set up the combos fast enough, so
I could consolidate in the empty holes left by "his" jumps.  
"Gorgon/Cephalo Man":  These are the two toughest levels, because they
follow the minimax strategy of not losing.  The only way I ever beat these

levels was to go for an ambitious decoy/blockade idea, but it was
difficult to set up.  

               Comments?
