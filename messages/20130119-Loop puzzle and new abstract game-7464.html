Here you have what we call Loop puzzle

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.looppuzzle.com/">http://www.looppuzzle.com/</a>

Starting for this puzzle build very new abstract game.
Fascinating abstract game!!!

Hey fake game designers go ahead!
You have an opportunity to create a very very new abstract game : simple, elegant, addictive and deep.

Christian Freeling "best game designer" ha ha ha 

I deeply hate all the self-promoted game designers.
Each one covering the other.
Each one promoting the other.

Almost all crappy designers!!!!
Except Luis.
Remember my prediction : Luis will be very big game designer in less than 10 years.
He is the only one who deserves the status of game designer.
I`m not making this up or trying to create envy.
I`m not game designer not even an infra game designer but I know when someone is really here not for money or glory.
Luis is game designer as Rimbaud was poet.
