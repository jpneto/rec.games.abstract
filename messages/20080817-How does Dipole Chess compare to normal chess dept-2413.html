These are the rules to Dipole Chess:

Take regular chess, and prevent people from making non-capture moves
laterally or backwards (Castling is permitted also though).  Otherwise
it is the same.  Not only can you lose if your king is captured
(rather than checkmated), if you can't make a legal move, you also
lose.

My experience with the game is that it is easy to mess up in a big
way, with both sides reasonably close.  But the game can never end in
a draw, and will always run a finite number of turns.  Despite this,
and it being more restrictive as far as moves, the game feels pretty
deep.

I wanted to see if anyone else here had thoughts on this, if they were
to argue how much more shallow it is compared to normal chess.
