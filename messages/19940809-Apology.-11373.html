        I am writing you to both apologize, explain my circumstances,

  and actions in resolving the ignorance and bad netiquette I showed

  in posting that chain letter.



        First of all let me say that I am extremely sorry if I angered or

  endangered any of you legally by uploading that chain letter, which

  I did not know was illegal at the time I uploaded it.  The young

  man who uploaded it to my local BBS I informed (at 3 in the morning,

  I could not sleep) that such chain letters were a felony. He did not know

   either.  He has given his word to cease posting the chain letter,

   and I hope he tells whoever gave it to him to do the same.



        I have taken action in calling all places where I posted that

   or saw it posted and telling the SysOps to delete it.  Out of all

   the hundreds of messages I received from all of you about how you

   hope my access will be stripped, how outrageous my net behavior was,

   and how I should be prosecuted to the fullest of the law, there were

   a few messages requesting me to tell them more about this amazing

   "Make Money Fast" program.



        It is unfortunate that this kind of gullibity and ignorance

   exists, but if a few people were asking for a copy of the file,

   I am sure that this chain letter or others like it will appear

   again on the net.



        What have I learned and what am I going to do about it?

   The first thing I've learned is to be careful what I post.  Within

   hours every FBI agent and their mothers had called me to inform me

   that I had committed a felony, as well as hundreds of users from all over

   the world completely enraged at what I had done.  What I would like to

   do is hunt down all the locations of this chain letter, everywhere that

   I know it exists, and have it deleted.  You'd be surprised at how

   many SysOps either don't know it's illegal or don't care what people

   upload to their BBSs.  Anyone who would not know that this chain letter

   is a felony would repeat the mistake of uploading it to a USEnet site.

   I would also like to find whoever has been capitalizing off of this

   thing.  The user who uploaded it to my board informed me that his

   friend one place above him at number eight had made quite a bit of money.

   This guy might not even know that he's committed a crime.  I suppose

   if you murder somebody without knowing that it's illegal it is still

   murder.



        So what is my punishment?

   I asked the WELL administrator over the phone to "smite my account",

   I felt this was a worthy punishment, to be completely barred from

   the WELL.  He told me I was permitted to make one mistake of this

   caliber but if it ever happened again than I would be in big trouble.

   I think this is unbelievably kind of the WELL staff and I apologize

   to them for they are as much the victim here as you.  I must have stained

   their reputation forever.  I know if I were head of the WELL I probably

   would have deleted my account.

     We agreed that I write an apology, which is what I was going

   to do whether or not my account was deleted or not.



        Let me apologize once again.  You have no idea not only how

   stupid I feel but how angry I am at myself.  I plan on taking a

   break from the net for a while, then perhaps I'll return

   and indulge in the conversations that I used too.





                With Greatest Sincerity,





                        Jonah Gruber
