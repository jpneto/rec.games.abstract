Hi!

You can define a "step" in playing ability so, that you can beat 75% of
opponents which are one step below. 

Than you can define the "complexity" of a game as the number of steps in
existence in the population of players.

BTW,  it seems to me that the number of "steps" says more about human
beings,  and about the partucular human beings who chose to
play the game than it says about the game itself.

I heard rumors about go having ca. 40 steps, chess and other games only 12.

12 "steps" in human rated chess players is about right,  there may be
another step or two off the bottom (generally absolute beginners
don't bother to get rated),  but there's a real uncertainty about how
many more steps could exist above the top.  By which I mean,
I believe that in principle a player would only have to be about 2
steps above Kasparov to be unbeatable,  but of course I don't
know that.  Some people believe the number is far higher,
you can piss off a lot of people in rec.chess by bringing up
this question there.

Do you know any sources of this information or such messures about other
games than chess and go? Due to my interest in twixt (see other post) i am
interested specially in such numbers for twixt.
