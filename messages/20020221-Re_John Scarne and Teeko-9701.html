Didn't you see the picture showing all these movie stars playing Teeko
simultaneously against Scarne? If you don't know the names, try to find
them in filmographies. They were all celebrities. It's ridicilous to state
that the popularity of his game only existed in his mind.

Not as ridiculous as taking a posed and paid-for publicity photo as
evidence of popularity. Even before I checked the web and found

I was sure that that was just more Scarne hot air. It's possible that as
a result of Scarne's years-long publicity blitz he managed to sell
100,000 copies of the game, though I wouldn't bet on it; how many of
those games actually got played is another question. I used to own a
copy of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Scarne on Teeko<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and to play '58-Positions Teeko' by mail, but
I don't recall ever seeing a copy of the game, or a reference to it
outside of Scarne's own books. It's a decent game but nothing special.
Lines of Action is worth ten Teekos.
