The first Think Small game is over, and the results are printed below. Each
pair of entries in the columns shows a chosen number and the number of people
who picked that. So the winner is...
        Mary K. Kuhner <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:mkkuhner@genetics.washington.edu">&lt;mkkuhner@genetics.washington.edu&gt;</a> !!!!!

with the winning number 15. Congrats to her --- a vastly inexpensive prize
will be winging its way to her shortly. And now those results in full...

My apologies to those whose entry didn't reach me in time, for whatever
reason. There will be another game soon, and this time it will run for
longer.

No apologies, however, to one nameless person who sent in all the numbers
from 1 to 78. (Okay, it was Steve Hollasch.) Not only was he disqualified, but
all his entries were disqualified, as well. Hence the stats above. So let that
be a lesson to you, young man. Also, one R D Boyle sent in numerous entries
under different guises, but the Net Police sorted him out, too.

Thanks to everyone who entered, for making it worthwhile. See you next time,

(ps: Hopefully the above stats will make it even trickier for the next time ;-)
