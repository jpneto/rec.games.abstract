I don't currently read rec.puzzles, so this crosspost
was a little confusing:

Ah, so you weren't talking about Hex! This is a clue...

It sounds like you are not using the pie rule for Hex, also known as
one-move equalization. After black makes the first move, the 2nd
player has the option to swap sides if desired. All the Hex servers
I know of have this rule implemented, even the Hungarian one which
does it incorrectly. :-) 

Okay, so if I understand you correctly, no pie rule, Black moves
first, and once move number n^2-Wn+1 is reached without a win for
Black, White automatically fills in all the remaining cells which
guarantees a win for White. I certainly don't know the answer to
your question, but I can hazard a guess, based on my experience of
over 1000 games on the Playsite and Lycos game servers, mostly
on a 10x10 board but some 14x14 games as well. Even with the
swap rule, filling more than half the board is rare, even if one
player refuses to resign and forces the winner to complete the
winning path. So, WITHOUT the swap rule, it seems reasonable to
conclude that perfect play would result in an even shorter game,
even against the best defense. So I estimate Wn at (n^2)/2 give
or take 15%.

If you'd like more concrete conclusions, check out
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~queenbee/openings.html">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~queenbee/openings.html</a>
with analysis of all initial moves on all size boards up to 6x6.
For example, on 6x6 Black can force a win in 15 moves or less.
(That's total moves by both sides.)
But this is not the same as a completed path, so a few more
moves would be needed to complete the chain. Pretty close 
to the halfway point of 18 for 6x6.
