Wrong! Already such a forum exists - postal chess. I think you
will find that the games in postal chess are at a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> high level
(the top players that is...).

This is getting completely ridiculous.  The quality of play in postal
chess is better than over the board because players have days rather
than minutes to make each move.  Not because they are allowed to push
the pieces around on the board.

Yes, it's getting ridiculous but for reasons other than those you may 
expect... Ask any postal player (hell, ask me - i've played postal
before) whether they ever move the pieces around in examining variations
in their games. You will find that the answer is a resounding "yes".
That isn't to say that they do so always or exclusively, nothing can
remove the necessity of looking in one's head, but they nevertheless
do so. Hell, ask most any OTB player of merit whether they move the pieces
when studying at home or preparing/examining a new opening line. Same
answer... If postal players don't do it, then I suggest that we
poll them and see if this is so. Otherwise, if they do move pieces
then I ask the (perhaps rhetorical) question: why do they do it,
if it doesn't help them or offer them any advantage? In addition,
there is the issue of using opening books and ending books
which is the closest analog to a computer's disk storage that you
will find in the human realm - namely, chess books are non-volatile
much like the computer's hard drives. (And, yes, I know that hard
drives are more volatile than books for the most part but for all
practical purposes they are "static" in this context). As for the issue
of days rather than minutes, this does play a role but not as much as
you might think. Namely, most players don't actually spend "days"
contemplating their moves - usually minutes to hours. So,
this does have an effect on the play (removing the problems associated
with time pressure) but it is not the sole factor and it still doesn't
address the issue of why they move the pieces if it doesn't help. Maybe
you can tell me an anecdote of a great postal player who doesn't move
the pieces but I'm willing to bet that he/she would be an exception rather
than the rule.
