David,

I have downloaded the ZRF and plan to give it a look next week when I'm on
vacation.  Thanks.  Looks very interesting.  Better support for connection
games is my number one request for added features to Zillions.  Wouldn't a
good Zillions Twixt or Havannah or Gonnect or (etc.) be a great thing?

Adapting the same algorithm I used in Loop, I am writing a "Connection
Collection" package which will recognize wins relatively quickly. I will
include Hex, Y (official board and triangular), 12x12 Twixt, and some other
variants on the same theme. The key is to have six positions (or eight for
Twixt) for each cell (or hole). Then I manually define the directions "left,"
"right," and "adjacent" for each position. This makes the traversal logic
much simpler, when checking to see if a group forms a winning connection.

A full 24x24 Twixt board would exceed some Zillions limit, number of moves
generated I think, if I tried to adapt this algorithm. As you probably know,
there already is a Twixt package for Zillions, but I left out the game
object; it's just for Net play between humans.

Don't expect Zillions to play these games really well. It will recognize
tactical threats sooner, but it still won't have any positional sense on
the whole board. I will include Hex board sizes 7, 10, 11, 14, and 19.
The larger boards are intended for Net play. Maybe Zillions will play well on
7x7 with "unlimited" time per move.

David
