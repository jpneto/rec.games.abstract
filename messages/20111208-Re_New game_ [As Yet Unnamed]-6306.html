The amended rule may not affect actual play much, because as you said
it's only in rare cases where the difference matters.  It's more about
following the general game design principle that additional rules,
restrictions etc. only be included if they're clearly necessary.

That's also the main reason why I chose a misère combinatorial goal
for Ayu. The inelegant alternative would be establishing a primary
connection goal and a secondary combinatorial goal for stalemate
positions, which wouldn't even have been an improvement in terms of
strategy and tactics.

btw I like the starting set-up for Ayu.  It occurs to me that many
games could perhaps be invented using this set-up to advantage.

I agree. It's really the perfect alternative to the checkered pattern
(as seen in Clobber) for non-capture games.

It's been tried in Go, for example:
