Hey all. I'm living in Knoxville TN now. They are having a festival soon called "open streets Knoxville" where a mile or two of road is blocked off for 4 hours so that people can walk around on the street. There will be all kinds of free activities. I thought to set up a table or two with interesting short abstracts for people to try. I haven't played in a while so I'm here. What's interesting lately? What's a classic that I shouldn't forget. When I was playing a lot of abstracts slither and oust were pretty popular. I'll probably show those as well as maybe some from the stacking contest of 2011.

Daniel
