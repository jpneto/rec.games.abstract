This morning I waked up earlier. So I decided to read the Nestor game design contest. Use rings and pawns to create a game.
I will never participate to any contest simply because I hate all the rewarding system (Nobel Fields Medal Goncourt and so on). It is often biased open only to kow-towing people.
It took me 2 hours of reflexion and here is my game.
I will post it tomorrow as soon as I finish it.
Hey Mark! You will be really surprised (badly? happily?).
I do not know but I want your comments before anyone else.
I know that you are avaricious when it comes to the words insults excepted.
But I will be happy to hear your opinion.
