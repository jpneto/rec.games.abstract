Mark's pathetic attempts to spam my colleagues
will not have any effect here, other than causing
the usual amusement at crackpots.

BUT -  the interesting thing is that Mark is clearly
getting rattled!  He is obviously starting to hurt
from the mass migration from r.g.s to r.g.c .

Poor old Mark - he never thought his long-term
plan of influencing people with constant ill-will
and vile language would ever come back to bite him.

So thanks, Nick and Corey, keep up the good work,
and count yourselves applauded by Mark's screeches!

yeah Steere has definitely been showing signs of weakness lately,
culminating in this harebrained scheme of his. Although I think he
might still have a chance at a spinoff. We could call it Steere in
Cyberia.
