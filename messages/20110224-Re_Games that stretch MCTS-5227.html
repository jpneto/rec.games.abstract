Thanks guys!

Mark: Flume does indeed look applicable on a number of counts;
composite moves, large branching factor and the immediate reward of
each move is not obvious. Would you say that the complexity of the
moves gives it low in clarity?

Christian: Yes MCTS is revolutionising AI for a lot of games, we might
be seeing a paradigm shift away from alpha-beta search.

Greg: Thanks I'll check out Cluster. UCT tends to play poorly in most
cases unless tweaked or enhanced with domain knowledge - do you think
this was more pronounced than usual with Cluster?

I've also wondered why there have been no publications on UCT for
Chess - that's usually the first game that AI researchers attack!
Presumably the results are not good, and the Chess AIs these days are
so good that there'd be no comparison. I guess the more subgoals or
strategies that a game requires to be played well, then the more
domain knowledge has to be incorporated if UCT is to work; perhaps I
should be looking at the distinction between tactical and strategic
games.

Without adding significant domain knowledge, yes.

Games which UCT excel at seem to be reduction games where the moves
tend to diminish and/or there is some "force" driving the game to an
end.
As an observation, many (if not most) of Mark Steere's games seem to
have that property so perhaps Mark has created fertile territory for
UCT :).

Contrast that with positional games which can stalemate.  I'll make an
arguable and brash statement that, in general, if a game can end in a
draw (typically with pieces cycling around the board to no end), then
it's likely not a good fit for UCT since I believe UCT will have a
hard time finding the narrow line(s) of play which leads to a win.
UCT "wants" the search space to be cone shaped tapering at the end, it
doesn't like "needle in the haystack" end games where the ratio of
wins &amp; losses to the remaining search space is small.

Here's another thought.  Positional games like Chess can be
problematic due to the heavy demand on move generation during
playouts.  One could randomly select a piece and select from the
potential moves for the single piece.  However, that leads to biases
since not all pieces have the same number of moves available to them
so pieces which have many moves will tend to be under represented in
the playouts.  This applies to other games as well.  An unbiased and
fast playout method is a huge bonus.  As you well know, connection
games lend themselves to quick playout methods, but that advantage
doesn't appear to generalize to the broader class of games.
(e.g. a "random fillout" of pieces in Chess would probably not make
much sense)
