Hi folks,
 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not sure there is a game so deep an open-ended that doing an opening
analysis would be futile. Whether a game attracts such analysis, like chess,
go, monopoly or diplomacy have, is dependant on its popularity, not so much
its nature (or perhaps, its nature has to be such to make it wildly
popular). Popularity is the important key because if only one or two people
are interested enough to study and publish something, they're not likely to
have gotten the final correct ideas, but just the groping, starting ones.
