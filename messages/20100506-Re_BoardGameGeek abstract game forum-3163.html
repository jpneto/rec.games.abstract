What have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ever done to advance abstract games, Rich?  You're not
promoting abstract games.  You're promoting Richard Hutnik.  That's
what you're promoting.  The only thing you're doing with abstract
games is exploiting them.

Yes, and that was my sincere intention.  It wasn't an invitation to
jump on my coattails with two muddy boots.  First you butt into my
conversation with Arty about my Mad Bishops design with some asinine
suggestion, which faux pas I overlooked.  Then you barrel into my bgg
Oust topic like a urine soaked bum with a 6 tequila IQ.  Get the fuck
out of my face, you clod!

Rich, I'm a designer.  Whose games am I supposed to promote, Christian
Freeling's?

Yes, you got your games in Games
Magazine, and on multiple websites.  But really, how successful has it
been?

I often hear about how insignificant I am compared to so-and-so.  But
if you look at all of the MSG games that are played at all of the
sites they're on, it adds up to a lot of play time.  Of course it's
"just" the Internet.

Maybe you take solace in a belief that abstract strategy games
won't really amount to much anywhere,

I don't think abstract games will ever become all the rage, but I do
think they'll "take over a larger chunk of the pie" in spite of your
efforts to prevent that from happening.
