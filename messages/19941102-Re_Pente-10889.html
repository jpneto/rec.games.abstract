: Anybody here play Pente?

I do.

: Is it true that Pente is the same as Go-Moku?

I don't think so.  I've read the rules to Go-Moku, and although I don't
play it I remember that is was similar, but different.

Pente is played on a full-sized Go board.  Isn't Go-Moku played on a
smaller board?

The object of Pente is to either capture 5 pairs of your opponents
stones or to get 5 stones in a row.  I don't think Go-Moku has the
5-in-a-row option, but I don't remember for sure.

I think Pente can be played by up to six players in teams.  You can
certainly play with four in teams or individually.  Go-Moku is only for
two players, isn't it?
