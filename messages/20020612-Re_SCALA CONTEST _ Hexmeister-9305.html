Hi John,

I would like to join the tournament, but am afraid that it would take
quite a long time to finish it.

Right now, I don't think the game is flawed.

Hello Ralf,

It might not take as long as you fear.  The games we have played have
lasted between 13 and 20 moves, played out to the end.  Joao and I
play at the rate of about four moves a week, which means the games
lasted under a month.  More than half were won by the second player
(not what I expected).  The example Joao included in the announcement
was one of them.  We were starting to play each game the same way, and
I wondered if Scala has enough "depth".  We want to see if other
people came up with the same or different strategies.

John
