I just caught onto this story, so if I'm misinformed then I'll
retract this but I must say that my first reaction is that
indeed the Chinook team deserves to be accused of poor sportsmanship.
I think it's perfectly honorable for Tinsley to offer his resignation
but the Chinook team should have refused to accept it and instead
arranged for the match to be held at a future date.

This has been done.  Tinsley has declined playing us in the next week and
has not responded to a suggestion of playing us in the near future (in
September or October).

Tinsley showed immense sportsmanship in ever agreeing to play Chinook
in the first place and certainly he exhibited supreme sportsmanship
(if not quixotic behavior) by agreeing to terms that favored the machine
(i.e. where fatigue played a role on the human and not the machine).

As in a previous posting of mine, we were aware of the possible fatigue factor
and did everything possible to eliminate it.  Tinsley was very happy with
with the match arrangements.  Tinsley has said that the arrangements in 
London (1992) and Boston are far better than for any other match he has
ever played.

For the Chinook team to accept this resignation is absurd.
I, for one, would rather have my dignity and honour (as well as 
my self-respect) than to accept a resignation on such terms.
Of course, Chinook has no culpability - it's a machine after all, but
the team of humans who are behind it should be ashamed of themselves.
They've gained a title but lost my respect (and I'm sure I'm not 
alone).

We did not ask for the title.  Tinsley made up his mind to resign the
title, communicated it to the powers that be, who then conferred the
title on Chinook and sanctioned the Lafferty-Chinook match.  The point is
that this was instigated by Tinsley, not us.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Then why did you accept the title?  I would be ashamed of myself if I
accepted such a title and did not immediately resign it.  In the first
match, Tinsley resigned his legitimately earned title just to play
Chinook.  Yet, you will not resign a meaningless unearned title.  I
agree with those who say you showed less sportsmanship than Tinsley
and I also have lost some respect for you because of it.

We <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> want the title.  We only want to play Tinsley.  Had we leg-
itimately won the title, we would have immediately resigned it and the program
would have probably been retired. As it is now, we are in Boston with an
event that has been organized and paid for.  We did not want to play Lafferty,
but were convinced to because it is in the best interest of everyone that
the event continue.

I don't see how a meaningless title match is in the best interest of
science or of checkers.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
We are making every attempt to reschedule the matchs with Tinsley.  Tinsley
is the best.    The title is meaningless to us .  It only means something if
you win it against the best.  Imagine, for example, how Karpov felt in
1975 after "winning" the title from Fischer.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If the title is meaningless to you, then why don't you resign it?

Karpov's situation was different from yours.  He was declared champion
because Fischer would not play (except under terms that he knew would
not be acceptable).  I think it is clear that Fischer did not want to
play.  He did not play any games after winning his title (that is,
until his "rematch" with Spassky 20 years later).

Tinsley was willing and did play.  He needed a postponement due to ill
health.  You were declared "champion" without winning a single game in
the match.  All the games played were draws thus, the match should be
declared a draw with Tinsley retaining his title.  If the checker
federation instead awards the title to you, then you should
immediately resign it.
