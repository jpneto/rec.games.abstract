Hi, this is the first part of the Sandwiched (SW) Horse opening series. This
opening was first used by Chinese players way back in the 1950's. However,
it did not catch on with the players as most games were won by Red's central
Cannon opening. It was only till late 1960's that Hu Rong Hua (again!)
started experimenting with this opening. It was a considerable success as he
won many games playing Black and it finally caught the attention of the
other Xiangqi players.

In the 1st first part to this series, I shall describe the 'early' openings
which Hu used in the 60's.

SW Horse #1
Black 7th soldier variation

1  C25   H2+3
2  H2+3  C86
3  R12   S7+1
Black advancing 7th Soldier on the 3rd move because in the 60's, the players
had yet to find a solution to Red's S3+1

4  R2+8  A4+5
5  H8+7  C2-1 (See diagram)
Of course, If Black C6+5 now, Red can C5+4.

     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

     r . e . g a e h r
     . c . |\a/| . R .

     R . E A G A E . .

     9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Option 1
6  R2-1   E7+5
7  C89    H8+6
8  R2+1   C67
9  R98    R12
10 E3+1   S7+1 ! To pave the way for Black Horse
11 E1+3   H6+7
12 R2-1   R97  Black has reached a satisfactory position

 From Option 1, we find that Red Rook has moved many times back and forth as
Black pieces are gradually developed by threatening the Red Rook. Hence this
option is not satisfactory.

Option 2
6  R2-2   C2+2
7  C89    H8+7
8  R98    R12
9  R8+4   E7+5
10 S7+1   H7+6
11 R24    H6+7
12 R4-3   R97! If Black S7+1? then Red S7+1!; Now if Red R43, C67 can regain
1 piece. The situation is even now.
