As it happens, I am working on a program to play Hex as part of my

play Hex well.  The standard methods used for chess programs are pretty
feeble for Hex, compared to the reasoning power of us human players.

This will probably not be of much help for the general case, but with
the modification that the board is of size Nx(N-1) and the second
player has to connect the shortest distance, the game is a sure win
for player two.

The strategy works as follows: divide the board into two equal-sized
parts along the short diagonal. Every time player one places a stone
in one half of the board, player two places a stone in the other half
at the position 180 degrees opposite (imagine rotating one board half
on top of the other). It is relatively easy to show that this will
eventually end in a win for player two.

I do have a small suggestion for the normal game: calculate for each
hex the distance to the nearest black minus the distance to the
nearest white stone. This difference counts towards blacks score. A
stone is then played to maximize the score.

This is probably not enough in itself to make a good play, but other
factors can be used to calculate the score.
