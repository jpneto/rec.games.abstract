You need to difdferentiate between someone preoposing a new game

That isn't a change in the rules of chess.  It is a change in 
tournament rules, which are already fluid and changable.  You
don't need to propose anything to improve tournament rules.
Just have a tournament with whatever rules you like and be sure
to announce the new tournament rules in advance.

Changing the rules of chess won't change that.

It rides on its laurels and tells people to make suggestions

Whoever told you that got it wrong. There is nothing wrong with 
chess.  Period.  There is nothing that needs fixing about the 
way chess is played.  The rules are just fine.  Nothing needs 
fixing.

Beyond this, do I need to go and explain about the draw issue that
happens on the highest level?  The scoring system is codified for
draws. These are the tournament rules.  People make excuses and
rationalize this and that.

Again, if you want to change the tournament rules, you should talk
about that, and if you wish to change the rules of the game, you
should talk about <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Mixing the two kinds of suggestions makes
it hard to analyse your proposals.

What  I was trying to do is recognize that a bulk of players are FIDE
purist out there, and suggestions about the direction chess could head
in, complete with possible changes to the rules, is considered
heresy.  This crowd would be a number of people you find at chess
clubs.  I know a club where I am local that it is FIDE Chess and that
is it (ok, Speed version, due to their time limits).  For them, what I
discuss here IS heresy.  I acknowledge what I write as possible heresy
and leave it at that.  I know this from personal experience actually.

You are wrong.  You seem to be unable to understand that someone 
might disagee with you because your ideas suck, rather than doing 
so for religious reasons.
