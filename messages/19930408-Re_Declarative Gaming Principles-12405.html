A friend of mine and I came up with a chess variant that we called
"Mutagen".  The game is played on a standard chessboard with the
standard pieces, and adds to this a sheet of paper, a pencil, and a six
sided die.

All pieces start out with the move of one forward, capturing any pieces
on the square it moves into.  Each player rools the die before moving,
and if a six is rolled that player makes makes a rule (to be written on
the paper).  The rule must be evenly applicable to both sides (ie. "I
win" is not allowed) and is followed to the letter for the duration of
the game.  A rule may nullify a previous rule, but if a later rule
nullifies the nullification, the later rule cannot be nullified (does
that make any sense?).

Play gets really interesting when it is realized that a rule was written
down either incorrectly, or vaguely, creating unsuspected results in
later application.

The game is never the same twice, and takes on some aspects of
performance art when played (although it becomes very boring very
quickly when one of the players is playing to win).

Does this fit the category of "declarative game"?
