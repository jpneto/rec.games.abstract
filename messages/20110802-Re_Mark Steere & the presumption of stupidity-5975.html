Well, then you solved it all right. Personally I <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>like<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a small grey
area between win and loss. Beautiful things must often happen for
players to even get there, provided it is sufficiently small. In
Havannah a game must be a strategical and tactical tightrope to even
get there.

So elaborating on my answer to Michael's post, I think a queen that is
restricted to the king's move if moving out of check is more natural
than the baby drain. If a queen is not allowed to give birth if
capturing or if moving out of check, I think the margin of draws would
be very small and implicitly interesting.

I know you don't like grey areas. Black and white makes things simple.
So don't bother to ridicule my view, consider it done ;-)
