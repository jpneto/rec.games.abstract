The 2nd edition will apparently be printed in four volumes (as opposed
to the two volumes of the 1st edition).  I haven't had a chance to
compare them, to see how much new material there actually is.

I would be interested in hearing about what new stuff there is. I might buy
the new edition if there is enough new stuff. I have the paperback edition,
which seems to have had some corrections in it. Our library has On Numbers
and Games, so I have access to that book if I want to look at some of the
proofs showing the equivalence of numbers to a subset of games.

I just got (a couple of hours ago) Berlekamp's book on Dots and Boxes,
so I should have up to date stuff on that part of the book.
