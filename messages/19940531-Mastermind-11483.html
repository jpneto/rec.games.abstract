I've been curious for many years about the game Mastermind.

For those unaware, it is played by two players, a Hider and a Guesser.
First, the Hider chooses a secret arrangement of colored pegs.  Then,
play alternates: the Guesser places a permutation of colored pegs on
the board, and the Hider compares the latest guess to the hidden code.
If they match exactly (in color and position) then the game is over;
otherwise, the Hider gives a Black clue peg for each peg in the guess
which is the same color and occupies the same position as a
corresponding peg in the hidden code, and a White clue peg for each
peg in the guess which appears in the hidden code, but in a different
position.  The object is for the Guesser to get the right code in the
least number of guesses.  (There really isn't much for the Hider to do
after the game starts).

Recently I wrote a computer implementation of the game, which played
both sides of the game, with one addition.  Basically, the Hider can
cheat, by changing the hidden code at any time, as long as every clue
given in response to every previous guess is still valid.  The program
works, but I am not sure that it is playing the "best" it can play
(partly because I don't know for sure what that strategy is!)

I have a couple of questions: Has anybody else studied this game, and
can somebody refer me to any published studies?  In particular, for
the standard game (6 possible colors, 4 positions) I believe (from
experience) that even with bad luck it should take no more than 5
turns for a Guesser to pin down the hidden code.  Also, if allowed to
"cheat", I believe that the best possible response to a guess by the
Guesser is for the Hider to place either 1 Black and 1 White clue peg,
or 2 White pegs.  These statements should be provable, (or
disprovable) but I'm not sure how to do it.

Thanks for any response.  Email please, and if there are more than
just a few responses I'll post a summary.
