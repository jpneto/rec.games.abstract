  I expect that within, probably, ten years (twenty at most), chess will
be "solved" by computers, meaning that it can be shown with certainly that
either white or black is guaranteed a win with proper play
(sequential-turn games usually favor the first player when "solved").

Well actually there is the third possibility of a draw. That may turn
out to be important, if it is the result (as would be many people's
guess) because it probably means a search down a fairly deep tree.
If you try working out quite how deep this tree is (at least 50 to 100
two-ply moves based on real chess games, possibly more) and how fast it
branches (almost always a double figure number of options) it is
literally astronomical. If instead you start with all positions, that's
similarly astronomical. Assume the best parallel supercomputer and even
Moore's Law doubling every 12 months only wins you a factor of a
million, which is chickenfeed. Solving chess is not on by brute force.

On the other hand merely producing a program that no human can beat
is relatively easy, if anyone has the interest (I understand that
progress on world class chess computers is a little slower at the
moment than it has been. I may understand wrongly however.) That
still leaves the question as to whether humans will still draw with
it. (My guess would be, 20 years, some draws.)
