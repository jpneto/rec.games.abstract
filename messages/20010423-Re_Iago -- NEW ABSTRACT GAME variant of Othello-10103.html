I once suggested a variant where you start by taking turns to place a
number of tokens on empty squares on the board (though not next to the
midlle four squares). The game is then played normally. A token blocks
the square in which it is placed, so no move on that square is
possible. A token is colourless, so it works like the edge of the
board.

Another variant will make complete search by computer more difficult:
Each disk has a cross marked on both sides. A disk can be oriented so
the cross is either like an 'x' or like a '+'.  When placing a disk,
the same-colour disk at the other end of a line must be aligned such
that one of the arms of the cross points in the direction of the line.
Otherwise, that line isn't turned over. The new disk must also be
placed such that an arm points in the direction of the line that is
turned. Hence, a new disk turns either horisontal and vertical lines
or diagonal lines and, similarly, a disk already on the board allows
turning of lines in only four of the 8 directions. The disks that are
turned over are oriented by choice of the player who does the turning.

Fascinating!  Have you tried this?  Do you have any sample games to share with
us?  Also, does anyone out there think that it could be implemented with the
Zillions engine?

I have tried a single game with the token-placement variant on a 10x10
board. It worked well, but we were quite civilised when putting down
tokens, so no areas were cut off by token placement. For a general
game, it might be necessary with added limitations to avoid this.

I haven't played a full game with the crosses variant, but I once
enumerated the openings after 3 or 4 moves and found that there were a
good deal more than in th estandard game. I don't have the papers
handy, so I can't tell you the exact numbers.
