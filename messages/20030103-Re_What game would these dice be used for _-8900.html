It's a Poker Dice set. As you mentionned the letter R,D and V on the King,
Queen and Jack faces, I can say that it's a French set (respectively Roi,
Dame, Valet)

You'e got several local rules for this games, here are some ...

One is to get the highest hand with the five dice in three throws (it's the
way I practice it). See below for raking.

One other :

POKER DICE
[source: John Scarne, "Scarne on Dice"]

Similar in some ways to Indian Dice. It is usually played with five
poker dice whose sides bear the playing card denominations: Ace, King,
Queen, Jack, Ten and Nine although the usual spotted dice are some-
times used, Ace being high followed by 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 in that order.
The Ace is also sometimes played wild.

Any number can play and each player throws one die to determine
the order of play, highest man going first, next highest second, and so
on.

The object is to throw the highest poker hand in either one or two
throws as desired.After the first throw, the player may stand pat or may
draw (as in draw poker) by throwing one, two or three of the dice
again. The object is to secure high poker hands which rank as follows:
five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, straight (any five cards or
numbers in numerical sequence), three of a kind, two pair, one pair.

The extra die or dice not included in one of the above hands do
not have any value. If a player throws 4 jacks, for instance, the fifth die
does not help to decide the winner in case of ties. Tying players throw
off. In the two-handed game the best three hands out of five win.You also
could play Liar's game with it.

Hope it helps !

I have 5 identical dice that came with a bundled board games package
(chess, cribbage, backgammon, dominoes, checkers) - but have
absolutely no idea what the dice are used for ?
There is nothing in the game instructions that refer to them....

The icons on each dice face are as follows...

10 Diamond symbols (as per a deck of cards) - coloured red

9 Spade symbols (as per a deck of cards) - coloured black

1 Club symbol (3 leaf clover - as per a deck of cards) - colour black

King picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter R in the top left
corner and the letter K in the bottom right corner. colour red

Queen picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter D in the top left
corner and the letter Q in the bottom right corner. colour blue

Jack picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter V in the top left
corner and the letter J in the bottom right corner. colour green

Any ideas anyone ???
Cheers.
