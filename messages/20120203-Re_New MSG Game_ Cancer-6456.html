Yes, Mark, but Go without passing, while being an annihilation game,
does have deadlocks, and they're fundamental to the game. It plays
much like Go, but without the need to count anything. Deadlocks aren't
a bad thing, as long as they're solved at some stage of the game.
Gonnect is a great example.

What I'm trying to say is that Cancer without the "filling eyes with
cancer" rule is, quite simply, No-pass Go without cycles, or, what is
the same, Go with no cycles, no draws and no counting. How's that for
a game design ideal? With these features, one can say for sure,
without actually playing it, that this variant works pretty well,
aesthetic problems aside.

As for Cancer as presented here, it's certainly more "mysterious" and
probably less related to Go in actual play, so I can't really tell at
first glance if it will work or not.
