If you want to play Abalone without buying the game, you could always
get yourself a software version... I have so far found two versions using
FTP:  I can't remember where they are but this might help you find them.

One was in a info-mac directory, and required a Mac running System 7 or later

The other was an MS Windows application where all the text is in German

Happy hunting...

The guy didn't say "I wan't to be a thieving idiot and bypass the $30
required to play Abalone"  He said: "I'd like to see a copy of the rules
so I can decide whether the game is worth the $30.

The rules are like this:

1. Each player starts with 14 marbles arraged on a 5-hex as follows:

    o o o o o
   o o o o o o
  . . o o o . .
 . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
 . . . . . . . .
  . . x x x . .
   x x x x x x
    x x x x x

2. Each turn, the player may push or roll.  To push, pick up to three
adjacent, colinear marbles of your own color and move them one square
along the line connecting them in either direction.  A lesser number
of opposing marbles may be pushed along with your own if they are also
adjcent and "in the way" (two can push one, three can push two or one)
To roll pick three adjacent colinear marbles of your own color and move
them one space in any direction (opposing marble may not be pushed in
a roll)

3. marbles which are pushed off the board are removed from play.

4. the winner is the first to push 6 opposing marbles off the board.

The rules in the game are a bit clearer in writing and have
illustrations to make them easier to understand, but that is the whole
of the game (unless I made a mistake --- I've been known to)

It's definately worth the $30 if you have someone you can play with.
