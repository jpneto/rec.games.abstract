What about draws? If a first move can be chosen which would lead to
a draw with best play by both sides, wouldn't that mean the game
is without advantage to either side?

This variant has been suggested for Hex, chess, and probably several
other games. In chess, you have to get out of check on the first
move, and may not deliver check until the 2nd. I don't know if it
is an interesting game or not.

Quarto has that feature: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/681">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/681</a>

How could you avoid draws in Hex, if there are three colors?
