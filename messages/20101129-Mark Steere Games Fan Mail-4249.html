Mr. Steere,

I am a college student who is doing a project involving your game Cephalopod
and will be presenting it to my class, just basically what the game is, how
to play, who invented it, and so forth. I realize you don't want anyone
copying your games, but in my presentation which is completely attributed to
your game if it would be against your code of conduct if I presented it as
3x3 cephalopod in which all the same rules are upheld and still no ties can
occur, for the sake of time in showing this game to my classmates.

thank you,

Dear Mark Steere,

I'm ******* ******** , I'm a student in computer engineering studies in
Belgium,

I really appreciate the work on games and dices you made,

I'm starting to learn C programming and I would be very interested to know
how the rules of the game cephalopod was implemented in a code,

All the Best,

******** *******

Not to complain about my own game, but I don't understand the ongoing, ever
increasing fascination with Cephalopod.

Most commonly asked question?  Why the name, Cephalopod?  The changing,
spotted color pattern reminded me of the skin of the cuttlefish.

-Mark
