Keeping with the Othello theme, I have a question:  Anyone here ever
play Dynasty(?) on the Odyssey 2?  It was an Othello game, but it
featured a variant I hadn't seen any place else.  In it, when players
placed a piece, they were allowed to only do one line (vert. horiz
diag) of flips.  I was curious if anyone tried that and if Orthello
might be more interesting if done that way.

I looked over the rules.  Can anyone who played it comment on it?  The
rules pique my interest.

I like it far better than Orthello, which it superficially resembles
in the flipping over pieces side.

Is "Orthello" significantly different from "Othello" (a.k.a. Reversi)?
:-)  All Google finds on "Orthello" is NetEssays.NET wanting to sell
me a term paper on "Orthello as a satistic figure," which is amusing
in itself.

Perhaps this is a name in search of a game...

What would Othello be like if you could only flip pieces along the
rook's-move lines ("orthogonally"), but not diagonally?  Anyone
tried it?
