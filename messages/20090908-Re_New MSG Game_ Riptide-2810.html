Thank you.  I really like that rule.  It incorporates itself
effortlessly into play and it buys you inestimably vast expanses of
game tree.  Normally I would never include a non-essential rule like
that in a game, but this time around it was all about the tree.

I can't really see how it would increase the size of the game tree.  You
disallow some moves and positions, so as far as I can see, this will
only decrease the size of the game tree.

Agreed. I bet we'll now be told the size of the game tree was unimportant..

Hmmm.  You've presented me with a dilemma.  Which of you two brainless
fucks is going to win the R.G.A. Brainless Fuck of the Month award?
Of course, any hot air blowing, brainless fuck such as yourselves
understands that to place a move restriction on a game tree reduces
the overall size of the tree.  Brilliant.  Staggering.  I'm truly
humbled.  "I can't really see how... [brainless fuck snip]".  You're a
math professor and you "can't really see how"?  I "can't really see
how" you're that fucking stupid!  "Agreed. I bet we'll now be told the
size of the game tree was unimportant."  No, brainless fuck #2.
You'll now be told how unimportant <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> are in rec.games.abstract.

There's one thing you hot air blowing, brainless fucks have
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>predictably<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> failed to grasp (i.e. I was certain that one brainless
fuck would step in a pile of shit but I never imagined it would
require the coordinated efforts of two of you).  Listen carefully.
I'm going to try to anticipate the reflexive straw man arguments from
brainless fuck #1.  If I'm allowed to cover all of your checkers, then
typically I can remove a handful of my own checkers from the board
while you just sit there with your thumb up your butt.  WHEN THE GAME
RESUMES, WITH BOTH PLAYERS TAKING TURNS, ONE MOVE PER TURN, THE
REMAINING GAME TREE WILL BE SPECKED BY WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE
HANDFUL OF CHECKERS NOT BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BOARD IN ONE TURN.  IS
THAT CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU BRAINLESS PIECES OF SHIT????  WAS THE
CONCEPT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT TO GRASP THE FIRST TIME AROUND, YOU
BRAINLESS PIECES OF SHIT????

After careful consideration, I think the R.G.A. Brainless Fuck of the
Month award for September, 2009 should go to Phil, putting Phil in top
contention for Brainless Fuck of the Year - 2009.  Phil went the extra
yard in this case with gratuitous cuteness.  Smug, brainless
fuckliness wins every time.
