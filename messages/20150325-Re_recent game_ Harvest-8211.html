Contests seem like a great idea, and maybe they are.  But everyone gets anxious about the judges, if any can be found; will they playtest the game?  Can someone program the games because some are programmed and some aren't.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  Then finally someone's game gets selected for subjective, ultimately arbitrary criteria.  Real contests are useful.  But ad hoc, web forum, poorly planned - no, make that zero planning - contests always end up being a goat fuck for one reason or another.  Case in point: Nester's Nestor-dominated, Congratulations-To-Me contest.

All of that would only be a problem if you care about winning and losing. :)

I still can't shake the feeling that there's a slightly better game with similar properties just lurking around out there...
