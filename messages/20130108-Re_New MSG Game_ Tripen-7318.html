It's funny, you don't seem real concerned about what you've told me privately over the years, Corey.  You want to stockpile high powered weapons for the purpose of "annihilating" people, and the only thing stopping you is you can't afford them.  Maybe it's a good thing you're a lowlife, so nobody has to get annihilated by you.

Lol, I honestly don't remember saying this but I'll admit it does sound like something I'd say. Although since the word "annihilating" was used I can't help but think this was another ridiculous joke. Some days I get really misanthropic and all but I try to smooth out my edges. The internet is a platform for any jackass to get on and voice his most childish and idiotic opinions without fear of real rebuke. I happen to be one of those jackasses. I dunno about being a low-life Mark, I live a pretty comfortable middle-class existence, have an ipad, a laptop and a Playstation 3. I'm not exactly destitute over here.

If your girlfriend has an abortion, they'll find her "in a bag upstream".  Lovely.

It's true, I find the standard for what dictates what is a human life and what is not extremely arbitrary (while having absolutely no religious affiliation.) I also find feminism and the cultural Marxism that pervades our society on the whole revolting in the extreme. I believe the father deserves at least some say in whether his child should be aborted or not. I'm also very obviously quick to temper. I think such a scenario would create something of a perfect storm. I'm just being honest when I say I would react when subjected to such an injustice.

You became aroused by the site and smell of a rotting dog carcass.  That was about the most fucked up thing I ever heard.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I did Mark? I don't remember saying such a thing although I do tend to make a lot of idiotic jokes. Although I can't help but think in that permanently drug addled state you're in, you've confused one of your own memories and are  projecting. I haven't even come across a rotting dog carcass in my life. The closest I've come to seeing such a thing was a gif of a couple niggers (not black gentlemen but full blown niggers) lighting a dog on fire and the first time I saw it I wanted to curb-stomp them both. I find animals a lot more agreeable than people. Also I can't help but think this whole rotting dog carcass bit fits well with this whole Norman Bates thing you got going on. Good luck with that btw. 

(although I do think you just made it up to be a total cocksucker)

You found the Marvin Spellbinder pic "awesome".  All that proves is that you're a hypocrite since you protested it publicly.  You always say you couldn't care less what people think of you.  Apparently you do.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I didn't find it awesome at all, I found it disruptive and a bit of a nuisance. Although I see a lot of shit like this (and worse) on the internet so I wasn't personally outraged but not impressed either.

Yeah I'm well aware of this but I still don't think I've quite outmatched you in the crazy department Mark. 

Okay so I really don't give a shit about any of this. What I cannot understand is how you find the information in the Christmas gift conversation so sensitive. I mean other than the fact that it certainly reflects on your lack of tact, common decency and total self-absorption but those are very good reasons you shouldn't have brought it up to a couple of internet acquaintances in the first place. Also iggc is not a place to discuss private information, anyone can pop in at any time and boom, conversation public. Its not like many people read RGA anyway. And Mark we should be combining our efforts against a common enemy, Abadoucha (or whatever the fuck his name is). Now you're just trying to provoke shit. To be honest I don't think anyone who knows me in this little community would have expected me to be anything less than an antisocial prick, so these should hardly appear as revelations about my character. But I'll say this Mark, in the event that you should start another flame war with me I saved a secret weapon back in October and if it comes down to who can sully the others reputation better this will be a losing battle for you. Don't say "what reputation" or anything like that, just move the fuck on. You got pissy over nothing and its time to let go, already this hasn't been worth the time and energy you've invested.
