Christian's certainly not banned. He resigned from the group
himself which was just a little bit of an overreaction to one goofball
who said something negative about one of his games.
I mean where is he going to discuss games? Here? rofl, good luck...

Thank you, I may need that indeed.
I'm glad however that we agree on Bill Taylor.

Carry on with that thought if it makes you happy.

The sad fact is that you can't even take the tiniest bit of
criticism of one of your games, without considering it
as a personal affront!

Well.  With an attitude like that, no wonder you're happy
keeping Stark Mere company!  Certainly with that personality
trait, RGC is much better off without you!
