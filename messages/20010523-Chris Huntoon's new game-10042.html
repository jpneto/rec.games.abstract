I believe, Chris Huntoon is becoming my favorite game inventor. Gorgon,
his new game (invented May 2001) is fantastic. Last night I played it for
hours!

You find most (?) of the rules at

I am not quite sure, but I think that jumping is compulsory and that you
must jump the biggest number possible.

The game appears to be influenced by "Altdeutsche Dame" (i.e. Old German
Checkers): the starting position, the movement of pieces and the
direction of jumping is the same in both games. However, the new rules
(jumped over pieces are petrified; no "real" promotion, but pieces reenter
the board at the opposite side (top &lt;--&gt; bottom only)) make this a very
deep and interesting strategy game.

Theoretically a draw is possible, but I am sure this will never
happen in a real game.

Chris has a tremendous creativity, which results in some of the best games
I ever played.

His other great invention is Tourney:

If Chris is reading this, could you tell us a little bit more about
yourself?
