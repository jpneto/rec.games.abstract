There is an idea in there perhaps to be a bit more serious.

Remember, during the Invasion of Iraq there was this official Iraq
government spokesman dubbed by the press as "Baghdad Bob" who daily
showed up for his TV interview in which he would claim that the
American forces were being decimated, driven back, wiped out,
surrounded, had no way to escape and so on, when in reality the
American forces were advancing rapidly, winning every battle (if you
could even call them battles). Even when the American forces had
entered Saddam's Hussein's palaces and set up offices there, Baghdad
Bob was still on TV claiming that the Americans had been utterly
destroyed.

  This is a bit subtle, but apparently, correct.  After convincing
the enemy that they are "on top" and "in control" by allowing
them to sit on top of your belly and pound your arms and sides
with their fists, only THEN are you in a position to gain control
of the situation, to lull them into a false sense of security and
launch a decisive counter attack.  Some call it jujitsu, others
call it rope-a-dope.

Now, we are having the same sort of things going on here in the Polgar
Wars. The Polgar Group has taken to declaring victory. Kind of reminds
one of the way that George W. Bush declared the "end of hostilities"
in Iraq. Here are some examples:

I see that you too are upset that your evidence and case is falling
apart Sam.

  I expect the SS case to fail via some technicality, or
because he may be unable to show that his reputation or
the USCF election was seriously affected -- or something
like that.  But even if so, it may not have been in vain if
just one slimeball is rooted out of the USCF establishment
for good.  But for that to happen, it may require a certain
degree of competence... and thus, I am not holding my
breath.

GetClub Chess was improved a lot So now Easy &amp; Normal Level will give
good challenge to you.

Play Chess at: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.getclub.com/Chess.html">http://www.getclub.com/Chess.html</a>

Now it will be much difficult to win at GetClub. Only Beginner will
play simple moves other levels will put a lot of effort and will be
difficult to win.

Yesterday Easy Level Draw a Game with Jester also. Play a game and let
me know if you find the difference.
