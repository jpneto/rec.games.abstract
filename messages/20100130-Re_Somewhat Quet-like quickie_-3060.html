This came to me while I was asleep, where I was intently playing it
against an unknown opponent. I have fairly lucid dreams and I think
I managed to transport a fair number of details back with me to my
wakened state, but have had to busk a bit too.

The board is a rectilinear grid, the important parts are the gridpoints.
In its basic form, a game is parametrised by board size, I was playing
on what seemed to be a 13*13 square in my dreams.

The game had 2 phases -  a preparation phase, then a capturing phase.
I have no recollection of actually performing the preparation phase,
but it was clear that there had to have been one.

Preparation phase:
Players take turns to select and mark a gridpoint which is not colinear
with any pair of previously selected gridpoints.

Capture phase:
Players take turns to connect a pair of gridpoints with a straight
line that does not cross any previously drawn lines. If said line
completes one or more triangles that contain no marked gridpoints,
then those triangles are scored according to the scoring rules in
force.

Scoring:
Well, there appear to be a fair number of possibilities.
The value could be twice the area of the triangle (the areas are
always half an integer), or the number of non-marked grid-points
in the triangle's interior (easier for pen-and-paper play).
The recipient of the score seems most sensibly the person who
completes the triangle, but as the points were placed by the
players, it would also be possible to give the score to the person
who has the majority of the 3 points.

Advanced variations:
Lest the above doesn't have enough complexity, rather than chosing simply
a size, the two players select and mark outermost points which must remain
the convex hull of the rest of the points in play.

Only-half-the-game version:
After explaining the game to my g/f in my just-woken state, wondered
if perhaps just the preparation phase might be an abstract strategy
game in its own right with a nim-like last-move-{wins/loses} rule.
Whilst certainly there's a parity bias, it does appear that there's
enough variation possible to make this standalone half game strategic
when the board size is large enough.

Here are some mins/maxes from a few thousand simulations of random
play on a square grid:
size 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
min  1  4  4  4  6  7  8  9 10 11 13 14 16 17
max  1  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 17 19 21 23 24 26
Greedy algorithms might be able to improve those bounds. (Please do,
the OEIS calls!)

Don't even mention play-testing - my g/f refuses to play, so I've
simply not had a chance to play it. As I have the random play code
written, I could monte-carlo an opponent up for the half-game,
certainly, but that's a task for another day.

Hi, Phil:

Following up on my reply in sci.math, the
version where last move wins has a first
player forced win for size 3.  On the 3x3
board, the maximal grid markings (subject
to no-three-in-line) consist of 4, 5, or 6
marked cells.  Perhaps the simplest way
for the first player to win (by steering
into a 5 cell maximal marking) is to put
the first mark in the center.  That avoids
any 6 cell maximal marking, as well as the
4 cell maximal marking that consists of
the four corners.  After the second player
moves, the first player can avoid all other
4 cell endings by taking a corner square
not adjacent to the second player's move,
as the following diagram summarizes (up to
isometry):

+---+---+---+
| b |   | c |   a: first player's 1st move
+---+---+---+   b: alternatives for second
| b | a |   |      player's following move
+---+---+---+   c: first player's response
|   |   |   |      forces two more moves
+---+---+---+

The final position will be a rotation or
reflection of this:

+---+---+---+
| X |   | X |
+---+---+---+
| X | X |   |
+---+---+---+
|   | X |   |
+---+---+---+

regards, chip
