I thought Mao was the game also known as Eleusis. It goes roughly like this.
 
The Dealer deals all 52 cards to 3-5 players. One card stays open in the center.
The Dealer thinks of a secret law, like `after a black card a red and
vice versa' or `next card should be higher in value'.
 
All players take turns in trying to put new cards on the center pile.
The Dealer admits only those cards that follow the law. If a card is not
admitted or if a player has succeeded in placing two cards in his turn
the turn goes to the next player.
 
The first player who succeeds in placing all his cards or who succeeds in
guessing the law becomes the next Dealer.
(Law guesses can be made only when one succeeds in placing two cards.)
 
The Dealer receives as score the number of cards on the pile, on condition
that there are not more than a certain limit, in which case he gets nothing.
 
This means that he has to choose a secret law that is difficult, but still
guessable.
