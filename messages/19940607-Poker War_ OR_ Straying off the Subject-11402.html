Using the rules I learned, war is a game with no strategy possible because
you don't have any choices to make. It's like playing Candyland or Snakes and
Ladders.

Yes, that sounds like the rules I have heard. There is a variant which
probably has nothing to do with the original post, sorry about that, which
we call "Poker War:" Each player starts with a shuffled deck, or one player
has the 26 red cards and other has the black cards. Each round starts with
each player drawing one card off the top of their draw pile. Whoever won the
last round begins betting as in poker, except you're betting CARDS not chips.
You're betting that your one card is higher in rank than your opponent's.
There is no limit, except you can't bet more than your opponent has. If the
cards are the same rank, the pot rides to the next hand. It's a fun game! :)
