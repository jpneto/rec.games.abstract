Thanks, at first glance I like chicken better. To give both the
opportunity to end the placing of neutral stones feels more elegant
and tense than having a placement stage preceding the proceedings.
More tense because it implies that the player who initiates the
neutral free stage obviously thinks he/she can make it, and a
misjudgement impies loss, either by the opponent completing a loop, or
by both failing to do so.

I'm not quite sure about the division that will occur between a player
winning by achieving the object, or a player winning because his/her
initiating opponent didn't achieve it.

The game played without neutral stones tends to a tie (an
understatement really). Your use of neutral stones steers away from
that. Continuous use would fill the board up with half neutral stones,
and a quarter of both black and orange. Hard to imagine how a loop
coould be avoided.

So obviously there's a stage at which a completing a loop will become
more likely ... for both. And if neither decides to put an end to it,
more and more likely, again for both (in principle, I'm not talking
about poor play).
So someone will snap out of it, inevitably.
If he/she will do so when the chances of success are 50/50, then a
similar division might result between games won by making a loop and
games in which no loop has been achieved.
This is not counting loops achieved not by the initiating player, but
by his/her opponent. So having say two thirds of the games decided by
an actual loop would be a nice outcome, I feel.

You're pretty good at this Nick, a pleasure to see you 'at work' :)
