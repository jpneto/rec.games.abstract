Hi people,

Talking with Bill Taylor, he noticed that if there was
no mistakes in some n-in-a-row game we were playing, the
game would be always the same, i.e., the perfect game.

That remark stayed inside my mind for a couple of days,
I think because it annoyed me the feeling that, in
perfect information games (i.e., no luck and no
hidden information), two players devoting enough time
and skill so that eventually are able to completely
master the game they love, will destroy it! The game
collapses to a single and fixed contest - always win,
always loose, always draw...

Now, in games where the random factor exists this does
not happen! I'm not talking of 100% random procedures
(they are not games) like the Roulette or the Lottery,
but something like Backgammon (a game with luck) or
Stratego (a game with hidden information). If the
balance of randomness is finely tuned, a good player
will consistently beat any worse player.

Facing two perfect players in a game like that, the
final outcome is not decided at all! Using a fair
random generator, each will have 50% of chance to
win, a perfect balance to give the exciting feeling
lost forever on a completely analysed game where those
"nasty" things, like Fortune, do not appear...
A statistical average of wins/looses ration will still
apply, but not for an individual game - the actual game
being played!

I'm slowly building the WAG site (200+ games right now),
where anyone can navigate in the Ocean of Games, but it's
an area of flat water, where nothing random or secret
appears to disturb the surface. With algorithmic evolution
(not just speed, speed is useless for Go), this part of
the Ocean will continuously grow smaller and smaller.

I wonder if, sometime, most of these games will have the
need for the Waves of Fortune...

Joao Neto
