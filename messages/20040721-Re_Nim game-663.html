The general rules of manipulating the surreal representations of
nonpartisan games are:
1. Both players always have the same options. (definition of nonpartisan)
2. The value of the position is the smallest value that is NOT available
as an option. (the Minimal EXcluded, or MEX rule)
3. Options higher than the MEX are superfluous to determining the
position's value. (the Sprague-Grundy Theorem)

Doesn't your 3rd rule imply equivalence among all positions in which it is
impossible in a single move to reach a position of value 0?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Correct!  If the MEX value of a position is 0, that means that there is
no option to move from that position back to a 0 position.  If the value
of a position is positive, then there must be an option to move to 0,
otherwise 0 would have been the MEX.  So, the positions can then be
classified into can-move-to-zero (also called Next-Player-Wins, "N",
"*", "star", or "hot") and can't-move-to-zero (also called
Previous-Player-Wins, "P", "0", "zero" or "cold").

So, why do we keep track of the actual values of N-positions?  Because
it is frequently the case that we are playing the "sum" of multiple
games.  A sum of games is played by, on your turn, choosing one
component game to play in, then playing a legal move for that
component.  In the basic Nim position that has been used in movies,
there are four heaps of sizes 1, 3, 5, and 7.  This is a sum of four
games, but just because you know each component is an N-position doesn't
mean you know whether the overall sum-game is N or P.

The solution is to keep track of the value of each N-position component,
and then add them up according to the "nim-sum" addition table.  This is
the famous "add in binary without carrying" rule, which is symbolized by
using (+) instead of the normal + sign.  The 1-3-5-7 game would sum to

     1      1
 (+) 3     11
 (+) 5    101
 (+) 7    111
 ------------
     0    000

so it is a P-position overall.

The process of analyzing any other nonpartisan game is identifying what
are the independent component games and determining the nim-value of
each one, and thereby computing the overall Nim value and hopefully
finding a move that changes one component to make the total Nim value
zero.  The interesting part of a tricky game like the one we are working
on (did we come up with a name yet?  I offer "Slicecake", to join the
existing games Cutcake, Eatcake, and Turncake) is that some moves cause
a change in the number of subgames the next person gets to choose from.
