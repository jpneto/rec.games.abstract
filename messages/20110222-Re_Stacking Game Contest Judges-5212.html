You really threw me a curve with your announcement that Monkey
Queen might not qualify, six weeks into the contest, while acknowledging
that the loosest definition of stacking game had already been agreed upon at
the outset.  I appreciate all the work you're putting into the contest but
for me, suggesting that Monkey Queen might not qualify while knowing full
well that it does qualify casts a shadow of doubt on how responsible you
are.  Why pull an obnoxious stunt like that?  Because Ralf Gering told you
to?

Ralf Gering has never written anything to me directly except something
along the lines of my post being inappropriate for his forum.
The only thing I mentioned was ths:

"QUESTIONABLE ENTRIES:
I've played a few of the games and there are at least two which
possibly don't fit the contest requirements!

Stax - hidden information
Monkey Queen - I can think of arguments for and against whether this
is a stacking game or not.

just a note: *The stacking element definition was purposefully loose
from the get go to motivate creativity and interesting games.*

....and just to state the obvious - this is not about the inherent
quality of either of the games

Thoughts?"

All I really wanted were peoples thoughts on the subject.  Now you're
questioning my responsibility?  ...

I don't want to watch a video of the judges effectively disqualifying Monkey
Queen by saddling it with deductions for "not really a stacking game" as
well as "bad theme",etc. - all the stupid shit that judges with no knowledge
of the contest parameters could dream up.  Can we agree that the judges will
judge the games on their quality of play only?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I understand this and assure you that games will be judged on which
game the judges like best.
