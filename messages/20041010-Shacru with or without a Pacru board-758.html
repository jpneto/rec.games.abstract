Despite my bitter, bitter disappointment [ ;- ) ] at the lack of feedback on
this
newsgroup from my two long gone requests for comment on Pacru which makes
its debut in Essen this year (and yes I know you need Internet Explorer to
try it out for free) , I offer up for discussion the game Shacru which can
be played with the Pacru kit, but can also be played with the following
rather cheaper
equipment:

[Shacru is suitable for anyone from age 5-7 upwards I would guess. If the
materials used are pleasant then the end result is an attractive mosaic]

1) plain paper on which a 3 by 3 large grid of square areas is drawn with
thick lines, these areas each then being divided with thin lines into a 3 by
3 grid of squares .   To put it another way - a 9 by 9 grid of squares
divided by thick lines into 9 equal square borderlands.  The thick lines are
called borders, the squares are called tiles.

2) 4 pieces each for 2 players, or 3 pieces each for 3 or 4 players.  Pieces
can be anything which is capable of showing direction of movement of the
piece
as being out of the side of a square, or out the corner of a square (i.e. a
piece sat
on a square always faces out in one of 8 directions).   If you've not got a
Pacru piece handy then a Knight from chess will do, or a circular coloured
counter with a white spot at one point on the circumference can do the
trick:
or some small arrowed object.

3) Some coloured pens, pencils so that the squares can be coloured in as the
game progresses.   Since each player will have one set of pieces and one
coloured pencil it is ideal if the piece is a shade of the same colour as
the pencil.

4) The Shacru rules <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pacru.com/rulesdiag/rulesdiagshacru.html">http://www.pacru.com/rulesdiag/rulesdiagshacru.html</a>
- only a few - the only adjustment required is that instead of placing a
coloured tile down on the grid you will be marking/colouring in tile on the
grid with your pen/crayon.

If you require clarification please email <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:info@removethisbitpacru.com">info@removethisbitpacru.com</a> and
I'll summarise any clarifications to the list.
