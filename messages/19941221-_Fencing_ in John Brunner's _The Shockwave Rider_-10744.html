In his book "The Shockwave Rider" John Brunner describes a board game
called fencing. It sounds interesting (sorry not to present the rules,
but they are two pages and I don't have a scanner; besides, it is
copyrighted by Brunner and I don't know if that would be "fair use"),
but a bit tedious to play on a board or on paper. However, it seems
ideal for playing it on two computer screens. Has anybody implemented
a system for playing it or made any experiences with playing it?

Please reply by mail (I don't read these groups regularly). If there
is interest, I will summarize. If you followup, you may want to edit the
"Newsgroups:" line.
