Depending on what kind of character you want to make, you
will want to maximize different attributes, and it's not
immediately obvious which ones or how much (example: for a
mage-type character, is Intellect more important than Will?).

You can analyze, you can analyze completely if you want to,
but I think few people does it, because 1) it's too much work
and 2) you don't get very much benefit from it (at most you
save 5-10% of your "points"). So the system mildly discourages
people from analyzing. It encourages you to go by intuition
(one player wants a smart mage-type character, another wants
a mage-type character with an iron-strong willpower - they
both turn out to be fine mages).

I would argue that you are not playing an RPG properly at all, if your 
aim is to maximise the powers of your characters.  That isn't the object 
of the game!  Strictly speaking, it is irrelevant, though I suppose one 
would normally want to have a reasonably competent character.

The game you enjoy is usually called min-maxing, not role-playing.  The 
game discourages it not to make the min-maxing more intuitive, but to 
make it less important.
