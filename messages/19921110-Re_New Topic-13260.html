|&gt;You know, Maybe it's about conceptual role playing games, or playing

|&gt;
|&gt;In any case.  Have any of ya'll played
|&gt;conceptual type games of any sorts?
|&gt;(Not like Amber, no dice..)
|&gt;We're talking no paper, no dice, just a GM and some people starting
|&gt;a story and interacting and seeing what's what???
|&gt;
While I'll admit these games can be fun with a good GM, there isn't much to say
about them.  No real rules discussion, or talks about skill % versus a level
system, no real meat.

I beg to diff about no real system or meat.  I once played such a game
during a 7 hour car ride where I was driving and acting as GM.  We were
playing using the Paranoia system.  I had read the GM's guide and had a
rough idea at teh time of how the game played, yet like many role playing
games I found that the administration for both player and GM can take
more time than game itself.  I focused more on the concept than on the
nit-pit details of the character skills and knowledge.  

Maybe as a topic of discussion, guidelines for Conceptual Role Playing
could be prepared.  I know they would be simple but the idea is to be able
to remember them in your head, remain fair, and consistent.  It is the
sort of thing I could see playing with a family during a car or plane
trip.  The fun comes from the interactive story being created and guided
and refereed by the GM.
