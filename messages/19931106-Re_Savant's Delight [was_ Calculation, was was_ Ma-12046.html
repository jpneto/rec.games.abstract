Yes, removing sets of four as they come together would make it much easier.
My (Tom's) way, you have to pay attention to the "parity, modulo 4" of the
deck as you near the end of each deal, and it may be impossible to get all
the sets of four that you pulled together to come out right modulo 4.

Also, there are situations where some cards are "dead" for the rest of the
deal, e.g.:

	x  7  x  x
	6  6  7  x
	6  5  7  6
	5  5  7
	   5

If you've just dealt the 5-5-7-6 above, there's no way you can bring the
sixes together this deal, because the set of fives cannot be removed.
Further, if you combine the fives on the leftmost column, you'll be able
to pull the sevens together, but you guarantee that the fives will NOT
come out right on the next deal.
