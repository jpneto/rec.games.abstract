There are no move restrictions. A player may create an even number of

We share one habit at least, but there's always a context.
Restrictions should not hamper a game but they are necessary to shape
it 'in its perceived spirit'. That's a crucial condition because
restrictions inherently modify and shape a game concept. To perceive a
game's spirit (will, intent) is the hard part.

That being said I have doubts about your proposal. I feel the
restriction is shaping the idea in a simple and intruiging way, and
more freedom will eliminate some very interesting tactics resulting
from it.

Luis solution to the 'odd' problem is basic to the very core: just
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>keep<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the number of groups odd. You can't beat that.
It's very reminiscent of the finding of Symple: simply penalize
groups.

I share your doubts. I'm just tossing out an idea. I don't know the
game well enough to evaluate it :)
