Hello,
rec. games.abstract is by definition about "perfect information, pure
strategy games":

If you disagree with that you're in the wrong group.

The charter given in this group's call for votes read as follows:

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Charter
-------

	The newsgroup would be for discussion of abstract games where
	strategy, tactics and player skill are paramount.  This includes
	the major category of perfect information, pure-strategy
	(deterministic) games, i.e. those with no element of chance (e.g.
	no dice), and where all information is available (unlike card games
	and Scrabble, for example, where players' hands are hidden).  The
	games under consideration are characterised by a simple board and
	pieces, with a small number of rules.  The cliche `a minute to
	learn, a lifetime to master' is often applied.

	o	discussion of less mainstream abstract games,
		which do not warrant a group of their own.

	o	design and implementation issues for computer players.

	o	develop generic code for computer programs,
		such as board widgets, alpha-beta and other algorithms.

	o	introduce each other to new games, thus finding new
		opponents.

	o	discuss strategy &amp; tactics for human players.

	o	what makes a {good,fun,hard,popular} abstract game?
		Will playing X be detrimental/beneficial to my Y playing? etc.

	o	ask `experts' for rule clarification.

	o	catalogue known abstract games, variations, genealogy,
		sources of equipment, literature, clubs.

	o	maintain a list of email opponents for various games.

	o	catalogue available computer programs for these games.

	o	maintain a FAQ, outriggers could be posted to other groups,
		get a mention in appropriate FAQs.

	o	propose and discuss new games or mechanisms

	o	puzzles for games other than chess et al.

	o	organise tournaments for various (obscure) games.

	o	organise an ftp archive, where useful information and games
		programs can be held.

	o	vote for the best and the worst abstract game of the year
		(or month or ever!)

	o	generally have fun in a decent way

The phrase 'includes the major category of perfect information,
pure-strategy games' makes it clear that other types of games are not
excluded.

An earlier version of the charter listed examples of games which would
be covered. At least one of these games was not perfect information.
