(This isn't a pure strategy game, but it is interesting, I think,
anyway.)

This is a card game for a plural number of players.

First, the cards from a standard deck (no jokers) are dealt face-down
to the players, so that each player has the same number of cards.


The players then each examine the hand they have been dealt, keeping
their cards secret from the other players. (Of course, if there are
two players, you know the cards your opponent have are exactly those
cards you don't have.) :)

All that matters in this game as far as the cards are concerned are
their numerical values. (Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13.)

The players each secretly on their own piece of paper write down a
series of letters ("U" for up, "D" for down, "S" for stay),
corresponding to a predicted outcome. (See below.) The players can
write down any number of these letters, 1 letter up to a string of
letters of length equal to the number of cards.

Next, the players take turns placing cards face-up, one card per move,
making a single row of cards on the table between the players. (I
suggest that each card be placed on top of the card below it, being
placed a little to the right so that the value of each card is
showing.)

After all cards are placed in the row, the players reveal their lists
of letters.

The winner is the player with the longest string of letters that
corresponds to any length of changes of consecutive numbers within the
row of cards.

For example, if we have the (short) row of cards:

2,6,5,4,7,9,7,1,2,2,5,8

And a player has "UUDDUSU",
then this corresponds to:
2,6,5,(4,7,9,7,1,2,2,5),8

because 4 to 7 is U (up), 7 to 9 is U, 9 to 7 is D (down), 7 to 1 is
D, 1 to 2 is U, 2 to 2 is S (stay), and 2 to 5 is U.

If this is the longest matching string (7 letters) of U's, D's and S's
by any player, then this player wins.

(Note: A player can always get a match, for example, by having a
string of one letter U or D. But then there is a good chance someone
else will have a longer matching string.)

If there are a number of players that all tied for first place, then
these players play again amongst themselves as many games as
necessary, eliminating players each round, so as to determine a final
champion.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
