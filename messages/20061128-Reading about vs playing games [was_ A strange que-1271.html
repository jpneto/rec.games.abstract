But that's OK, because I realize that I have another bad habit besides
failing to think things through:  I rely too much on reading.  I'm
reluctant to try anything new unless I've first read an instruction
book on it.  I don't trust myself to learn via hands-on experience, so
I always look for books first.  And sometimes I never get past the
book-reading stage.

That's interesting, albeit tangential. I'm exactly the same.
Furthermore, I like to take my instructions neat - i.e. in generalities,
and relatively free from  confusing real-life examples except where
absolutely necessary to clarify a point. Are we, as I suspect, in a
minority? Does this provide any useful pointers towards the writing of
rules?

Well, I agree that we're probably in a small minority.  Most people I
know just want to jump right in and start playing a game; they can't be
bothered to read the rules, and they barely have enough patience to
listen while someone tells them the basic rules.  Thus, old games tend
to be more popular than new ones; new ones have that nasty "learning
curve" to contend with.

As to reading about the strategy and tactics of a game, I'd guess that
even fewer people are much interested in that.  Me, I have a stack of
chess books, some of which I've studied--yet I'm still just a novice at
chess and almost never play except on the computer.  In my free time,
I'll much more readily grab a chess book and read a few paragraphs or
do an exercise or two than actually play a chess game.

Back in my teens, I read Hoyle from cover to cover just because I was
curious about all those games.  Decades later, I still haven't played
most of them.

I also went through one of your books, "Solitaire," from cover to
cover, btw, just because the descriptions made the games sound so
intriguing.  I'd read and reread, then sample each game several times,
and mark it with a code to remind myself how hard I found it and how
much I liked it.  That was some 25 years ago.  I still have the book,
but it's falling apart now.

In my twenties I was an avid wargamer.  But again, I'd buy a new game
and enjoy reading and rereading the rules, "playtesting" the game just
to see what it was like--and then never get around to actually playing
it against anyone else.  (A survey of wargamers in the 1970s indicated
that about nine out of ten people did just about what I did with the
games.)

As to liking the instructions "neat," I'd say that's true for me when
it comes to abstract games.  I don't see any need to tack a theme onto
a game like that.  The card game Lost Cities, for example, can be
played with a modified deck of playing cards, but it comes in a boxed
set with specially designed cards and an archaeological theme.  Players
are supposed to imagine themselves financing expeditions to various
lost cities, so of course the rules are written with that in mind.
Yet, it's such a thin veneer of theme that it seems pointless to me.
I'd just as soon play the game with standard cards (though it'd require
a fifth suit) and skip the theme or let my imagination wander where it
will.

But OTOH, there are games where the theme is everything:  role-playing
games and wargames and such.  If the instructions to those games were
too "neat," the games would lose all their flavor.  The theme is often
more important than the game play itself.

Then there are the metaphors within books on abstract games like chess
and go.  Generally speaking, I like those.  In those particular games,
they're usually military metaphors:  e.g., a player's pieces constitute
his "army" and the board is a "battlefield."  Such metaphors pique my
imagination and make the game seem symbolic of something significant.

Some computer games come with strategy guides, and I used to like those
a lot when they were better than most of them are now.  Typically a
strategy guide is nothing but an expanded rulebook nowadays.  But the
Master of Magic strategy guide--back when that game was current--was
top-notch.  I could sit and read or reread that guidebook for hours,
enjoying it sometimes more than the game itself.

So, I do like to read (and write) about games.  And yes, I suspect most
people would rather just play them.
