Rules for creating your own online game.

1. Do not contract out your entire website to megalomaniac designers
working for a separate company no matter how brilliant they may seem.
They will only appropriate the content to their own exclusive agenda
while you are busy marketing your product. And they will only encourage
ongoing dependancy.

2. If you do outsource your IT needs to an external company, bring in a
professional IT analyst to inspect the database that was built for you.
Do not let any programmer fool you into believing that a database that
uses flat text files is scalable and robust enough to handle 500,000
users.

3. Keep your game playable and enjoyable for more than 7 % of your
existing player base. If you find out that less than 10% of your
consumers was or is able to solve at least one step (or a mere fraction
of the first level of your game), take notice. You will have a problem
with word of mouth. Though you may not know these numbers if you have
no access to the data and
your megalomaniac designers neglect to inform you of these things.

4. If you want to sustain your online game for a long time, 100,000
casual fans playing a game they can understand and enjoy is better than
700 hard core fans playing a game they are psychologically addicted to.
Refer to rule #3 for the reason why.

5. If your megalomaniac designer from the outsourcing company begins to
insult your own staff, lock you out of servers under your domain, and
deny you access to source code, you may well be doomed. Especially if
you have already paid the invoices totalling hundreds of thousands of
your scarce operating dollars. Especially if they have complete power
over your core
product - your site.

6. If your outsourced website crashes during your busiest time of the
year and best time for expansion, move your website. That is if you
can. If you are locked out of the servers, and your web design company
continues to insist that the resold, discounted web hosting solution
they offer is better than the $4000 US/month e250 server sitting idle
right on the main pipe in
Palo Alto, do not believe them. If in the midst of this crisis they
refuse to move the website because they insist on being the only
company with root access to your server (because they insist they are
liable when something goes wrong, so not even an established hosting
firm should have root access)  they are merely doing everything in
their power to beat you into submission.
See rule number 1 for the reasons why.

7. When given the opportunity for class action litigation in alliance
with several other established companies that were also fiscally
damaged by the routine practices of the same megalomaniac design firm,
do participate.
Follow these very general rules, and you shall succeed in the lucrative
world of online gaming.
