With reference to White's last move:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
White: Right. I'm using my tank to blast my way out of the Cathedral.
  I roll a 20! Ack, weapon malfunction! Boom! Time to activate my 2nd clone.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

   If it weren't for White's weapon malfunction and near destruction (a very
unlucky roll there), I am afraid I would have been forced to ask White to take
back the last move, as it is illegal according to the latest copy of rules in my
possession.

   According to "Game Rules: Edition 4 Revision 45a" (with the inclusion of 
Goblin's Teeth), rule 427c clearly states that

	"At no time during the third Arkle may any place of worship (or other
	 building of religious significance) be damaged or destroyed by any
	 form of large weapon, missile, tank, ICBM, ICBD (*), battlemech, 
	 starship, dragon, or other large destructive influence. (A full
	 listing of prohibited items of destruction for each Arkle may be
	 found in Appendix Q section 4.)"

[ (*) ICBD: Inter-Continental Ballistic Dinosaurs, for those not familiar with
 Global ThermoDinosaur Warfare.]

   As you can clearly see, White's previous move was definitely prohibited by
rule 427c. However, it was quite fortunate that the resulting weapon
malfunction and subsequent potentially fatal "Boom!" is almost precisely the
penalty required for a breach of this rule (as outlined in rule 428c), with
the exception that White must also place $100 in Free Parking, and take a card.
However, since this is White's first breach of this rule, I think we should
ignore the rest of the penalty required and continue with the game.

Crimson.
