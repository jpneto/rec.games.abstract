I'm flattered that Lariat has inspired you.  My advice would be to
start fresh.  Try to come up with something that's unlike anything
you've ever seen.  One key element is focus, or looking at it another
way, freedom from distraction - mental noise and clutter.  A technique
I use (and this is how I came up with Lariat):  keep a picture of a
certain game board with you to remind you to keep thinking of it
constantly.  Lie down and concentrate until you get tired and fall
asleep.  When you wake up, immediately start concentrating again and
keep concentrating until you get tired and fall asleep again.  After
about three cycles of this you'll start to achieve real focus.
Relevant ideas will start popping up at an accelerated rate.
Irrelevant ideas won't happen.  You'll have a feeling of heightened
lucidity.  In my case I was holding a folded paper tetrahedron.  On
the third cycle I didn't need to look at the tetrahedron.  I could
"see" it, front and back, in "3d" so to speak.  The good ideas you get
may be tangential.  E.g. Lariat is played on a cylinder, not a
tetrahedron.  This technique isn't always productive.  You could do
this for weeks on end and never come up with anything satisfactory.
Take a few weeks off and start again.  That leads me to another key
element: endurance.  This process can be punishing.  But in the end,
when you come up with something like Lariat or Super Lariat, it all
makes sense.  It's ultra satisfying.

I try not to invent new games, because it sets me down the road to
distraction, but I was just inspired by Mark Steere's new game Lariat
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf</a>), which is played on
a cylinder.  I like the win condition and just thought of way one
might implement the same win condition on a standard 2D Hexhex board.
I haven't playtested this idea, but tell me what you think.  Here it
is:

Flat Lariat: the goal is to form a Lariat on a standard Hexhex board.
Players take turns filling cells their color, but <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the number<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of
cells that a player may fill on his turn depends on how eccentric
those cells are on the board.  There a couple of ways to implement
this idea:

1.  on his turn, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the cells that a player fills must lie along
one "ring" of the board, and the number of cells he can fill depends
on the eccentricity of the ring.  An open question for this system is
how many cells of each ring you can fill on your turn.  What do you
think?

2.  Each player on his turn gets a certain allotment of "placement"
dollars, and must spend a certain number of placement dollars to fill
a cell.  The cost of filling a cell depends on the cell's
eccentricity.  Filling the central cell is the most costly and
requires that the player spends his entire allotment to do so.

Please respond with feedback!
