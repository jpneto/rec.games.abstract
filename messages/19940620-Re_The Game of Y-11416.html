Last month there were several messages here about the game "Y", which
was reviewed in the June <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> magazine.  I missed that issue on the
newsstands, but I've managed to put together a little information on
the game.

The game is played on a roughly triangular board that looks something
like the following:

The spaces approximate ninety hexagons and three pentagons.  Players
alternate claiming spaces, and the player wins who claims a connected
area touching all three sides of the triangle.  Each corner is
considered to touch both incident sides.

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kjm@panix.com">kjm@panix.com</a> (Kevin Maroney) suggests that the game "Y" is the same
as "Poly-Y", and in a sense it's a special case.  Poly-Y is played on
a field with a boundary consisting of an odd number of sides.  For
each pair of adjacent sides, the winner of the pair is the player who
forms a connected area touching those two sides and an arbitrary third
side.  The winner of the game is the player who wins a majority of the
pairs.  I think the generalization from Y to Poly-Y is somewhat
artificial, so I prefer to investigate the former.  I'm told that Y
and Poly-Y were described in the book <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Mudcrack Y and Poly-Y<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, by
Craige Schensted and Charles Titus, which is now out of print.  I
understand the section on Y is being revised and will be sent to
purchasers of the commercial Y game.

I've never played the game, but it has several features that are
theoretically satisfying.  First, like Hex, the game is drawless in a
strong sense.  Even if play doesn't always alternate, and even if play
continues after a win, when the board is filled there will be one and
only one winner.  A second feature that makes this nicer than Hex is
that the winning configurations are common to both players.

A third nice feature is that the board can be considered to be half of
an icosahedron, with the sides divided into triangles.  The visible
vertices of the icosahedron are the three pentagons, the three
corners, and the midpoints of the three sides.  Note that the board
has only six symmetries, though, as opposed to the 120 symmetries of
the icosahedron.

What would be <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> nice is a drawless game with common goals that
has more symmetry.  My first idea was to extend the Y board to the far
side of the icosahedron, and look for a family of winning
configurations.  Unfortunately if the winning positions have the
symmetry of the icosahedron, this can't work: The second player could
always play opposite the first player, covering the board with
congruent patches.  This would end up with either zero or two winners,
violating drawlessness.  I thought of working on some partition based
on a tetrahedron, in which there is no inversion mapping to opposite
points.  But that won't work, either: The rotated inversion mapping
yields a draw.

Right now, I'm considering whether there might be a way to create a
family of winning configurations for the projective icosahedron, in
which opposite spaces are identified with each other.  It's like
playing Y, only every time you play on the boundary, you get the
opposite point of the boundary for free.  But the family of winning
positions of Y is not symmetric enough: There should be sixty
symmetries.  The idea is that the boundary of the Y board should not
have a special role.  Another possibility is the chiral icosahedron,
where the mirror image of a winning configuration may not be a winning
configuration.  In either case, I haven't been able to construct a
drawless family of configurations, but I haven't proven it's
impossible, either.
