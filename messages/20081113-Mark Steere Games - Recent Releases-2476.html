Mark Steere Games - Summary of Recent Releases

1. Loophole 2D &amp; 3D
2  Anchor 2D &amp; 3D
3. Lariat 2D &amp; 3D
4. Super Lariat (3D only.  A 2D version would be absurdly
complicated.)

I'm still working on the Anchor 3D paper model as well as re-
engineering all of the other 3D models to make them sturdier.  I
should have all the cutouts and construction instructions completed in
the next couple of weeks.

All of the above games are win loss complementary (WLC), a term coined
by Bill Taylor. I.e., a filled board always produces exactly one
winner.  They're also equal goals games (or equivalent goals in the
case of Loophole).

For the last fifty years or so, all we had were Hex and Y - the super
simple connection games.  Enter Lariat.  And that's all there is.
Lariat was the last piece of a three piece puzzle.  Yes, there are
other WLC, equal goals games such as Eight-sided Hex, but none nearly
as simple as Hex, Y, and Lariat - the HYL triad.

Super Lariat is super exotic!  ***Super Lariat is the only closed
surface, WLC, equal goals game in existence*** (using only Go stones -
no plastic bridges or other gimmicks).

With Atoll and Begird, I thought I had fully explored the
possibilities of Hex and Y generalization.  My reasoning at the time
was that neither the Hex nor Y principles can be adapted to a closed
surface, and therefore must be adapted to a surface with an edge.  I
stopped short of realizing that it should have been <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>at least one<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
edge.  Behold Loophole and Anchor.
