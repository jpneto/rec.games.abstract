I recall discussion of Settlers, where, instead of dice, it was
suggested that there be a deck of 36 cards representing every
permutation of dice rolls to come up.  This approach is to insure an
even distribution of dice rolll results to balance things out.

Ok, my question is this:  Let's say, we have a deck of 36 cards.  The
deck consists of 6 cards of each possible die roll on a 6 sided die
(1-6), for 36 cards (6 1's, 6 2's, etc...).  The cards are shuffled
and TWO cards are flipped over and a die roll result is generated.
What would the odds distribution be for doing this?  Would it be the
same as standard dice rolls or different?  I am curious, because I was
interested in kicking this around as a new way to generate two six
sided dice rolls.

It will not be the same as standard dice rolls.  Why?  Because the first 
card drawn influences what the second card can be.

For the first card, there is an equal probability of each result, 1-6.  For 
the second card, however, the chance of drawing the same number that was on 
the first card is now slightly lower, because there are only five cards 
left in the deck that have the value on the first card.

To put it simply, the chance of "doubles" results (1-1, 2-2, etc.) is less 
than it would be by rolling two actual dice.

If you're going to use 36 cards, and just want to generate a roll of two 
dice, though, you could give each card a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>pair<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of dice.  There'd be cards 
with 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and so on, up to 6-6.  That's 36 cards.  For two 
dice, you just select a card, and it's what you "rolled".  For one die, 
just select a card and take the first number on it.

With this method, the only thing you have to worry about is any lack of 
randomness in the shuffling.
