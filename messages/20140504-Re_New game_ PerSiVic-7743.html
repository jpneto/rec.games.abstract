I made two very minor changes to the rules. One, the stones don't move more backwards. Second, instead of 3, you need 5 stones in the last row to win the game. This changes make the play much more interesting, with very fewer draws, and really playable. 
I made a great change: a change of name. Now I refer to the game as FisFus. Persivic is a name that never like me. FisFus refers to the stones movement rules, making fision and fusion.
In some few weeks I think can publish a version in Android. (The code now runs human-human games but I'm working in the corrections to the human-computer issues). I think this will be a important push to make the game more popular.
I thinking too in make the game and the software Creative Commons, but in this I need some advice.
