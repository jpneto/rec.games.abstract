I may be imagining things wrong, but if Black opens with a white stone

For one thing, black can add more white groups. You're playing for the

Right, but if you dominate the center with a group, all your groups
will, in the end, be much more connect-able than black's groups.  I
wager that a center group makes them so much more connect-able that
Black's attempts to start more will be fruitless.  In the the end you
only have to connect two of your white groups to the center group to
make up for it, and in the meantime Black will be seriously segmented.
When I play through the scenario on small boards, it's not contest.
White crushes Black.  So if you're right, as the board size grows, not
only will this advantage have to attenuate, but reverse polarity.  How
would that happen?
