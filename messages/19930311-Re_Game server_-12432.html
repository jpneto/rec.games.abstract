I know at one point there was a MUD running which had a number of
board games available in one room.  As I recall, somebody posted details
to rec.games.go.  I've since lost the telnet address.  Does anybody
know where it is?  If so, please post and we can perhaps start using
it regularly for games.  I know it had Othello, Go, and at least a 
dozen or so other games which you could play.  Perhaps we could set
up tournaments there -- even multi-game tournaments!  This all depends
on finding the address, if it still exists.  Anybody?
