May be its because I choose what to comment about one cannot legislate
what people our to chose to write about, though your behaviour (see
below) suggests you may have a tendency to want to do that. Your
gratuitous insertion of insult into an apparently serious answer was
worthy of being corrected. I chose to correct it. Furthermore, if you
read what I said, you will see that everyone who had contributed to the
mud-slinging was included in what I wrote, though some were only
explicitly named. You yourself seem to have a high esteem of yourself,
which is certainly distasteful for me to see you comment on (respect and
true worth is measured by how modest people are in not elevating
themselves constantly above others, which is something you never seem to
be shy at doing.) It is matched only by your prima-donna-like leaving of
the recre.games.combinatorial list just because you were not being given
the attention and adoration you obviously felt you deserved is. Respect
should be earned, and you have not yet, in my eyes, earned it in the
area of interacting with people, given your comments and siding with
Mark Steere in the previous exchanges.

Well said and thank you, Bu Zhidao, you certainly have got their
numbers.

incorrect form you used (what you wrote was, in fact, "Mr Mr Don't
Know") As for being "unqualified to make any comments", that is just
another example of your own high assessment of your own abilities.

 However, the sense of your own self-importance you show is
completely consistent with you flouncing out of recre.games.
combinatorial in such a public way just because people chose not to
instantly comment on your posts, as if they were engraved in gold in
tablets of stone, or some other such conceit you seem to have.

In short: good designer of games; but problems in dealing with other
people, especially when he feels he is not being given the attention he
(unduly) feels is instantly demanded towards him from others.

Excellent analysis!   I appreciate and look forward to many more
of your sensible and reflective posts.
