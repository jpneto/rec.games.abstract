proper place for it.  Hopefully future discussions will use this newsgroup,
since that is exactly what it was created for (ie. this class of games,
which do not have their own newsgroup).]

  &gt;: Apropos: What about Renju ?  (the japanese professional variante)
  
  &gt;Unlike unrestricted gomoku, Renju is probably as hard to solve as chess,
  &gt;because
  
  &gt;(1) In Renju, positions that emerge after the opening are often of a 
  &gt;    "chaotic" nature, as the Japanese say.  It means that no one of the two
  &gt;    sides has a clear attack; many plans and many moves are possible, so
  &gt;    that the combinatorial explosion is really an explosion.  (Well, in Go
  &gt;    the phenomenon is more pronounced :-)).
  
  &gt;    This is very much in contrary to unrestricted gomoku, where, if
  &gt;    Black plays correctly, there are always few obviously strong moves
  &gt;    for Black and to each of these moves, a still fewer number of White's
  &gt;    responses (many times just one) that don't lose very soon.
  
  &gt;(2) Renju is a moving target.  Renju has a complicated "opening rule"
  &gt;    that serves to ensure more or less equal chances for Black and White
  &gt;    <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a large variety of openings.  From time to time (appr. every
  &gt;    15-20 years) this opening rule is changed.  (The middle-game rules
  &gt;    (forbidden 3x3, 4x4 and 6 for Black) haven't changed since 1936).
  
  &gt;    It is interesting that the main idea of the current opening rule, 
  &gt;    adopted in 1988-89, is the balancing scheme discussed not long ago in
  &gt;    rec.games.abstract: after the third move of the game (made by Black)
  &gt;    White can "change colors", i.e. decide that from now on, *(s)he* will
  &gt;    play as Black.  (This is only the main idea, there are many additional
  &gt;    bangs and whistles).
  
  &gt;    By the way, gomoku with appropriate opening rules is perfectly playable,
  &gt;    in fact, there were a couple of world chamionships.

From your description, it may be closer in difficulty to Checkers than
Chess.  In the Checkers program Chinook, the use of huge endgame databases
has a tremendous influence on good play.  Similarly, in Renju, a slight
modification of Allis' search technique could make finding a finishing
combination, if it exists, relatively easy for a computer program.

If the moves in the early phases of Renju are as complicated as you say,
then yes it would be extremely hard to solve, since we'd be dealing with
both a large search space and a high decision complexity.  In contrast,
Checkers has a narrow (effective) branching factor, so alpha-beta search
does well.  But I don't think the difficulty of Renju is clear yet, from a
computing standpoint.  Certainly, the strategic goal of Renju is not as
amorphous as it is in Go, or even Chess.  Perhaps time will tell.

  &gt;I haven't heard before that Victor Allis (, too,) solved gomoku, but with 
  &gt;all respect for him, the Black's win in unrestricted gomoku is known since 
  &gt;the 19th century, so that the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fact<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is not new, it can be only a new kind 
  &gt;of proof.

By all accounts, this "fact" has never been proven before, so it was never
"known", only believed.  In mathematics, conjectures believed to be true are
often <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>disproved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, so the distinction between fact and belief is important.

  &gt;Disclaimer: I quit playing Renju seriously several years ago, so maybe 
  &gt;something drastic has happened in the Renju community that I am not aware of.

  &gt;IF ANYONE COULD SEND ME ANY INFORMATION ABOUT VICTOR ALISS' PROOF, I WILL BE
  &gt;VERY GRATEFUL.
