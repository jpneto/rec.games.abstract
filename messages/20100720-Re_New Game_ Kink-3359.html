Thanks Luigi!  I was unaware of Squirm.  It's almost the opposite of N-
in-a-row, since a snake cannot have straight sections.  Note related
to Squirm - before settling on the rules for Kink above, I toyed
around with 2 other ideas:

1.  Allowing 2 (or more) Kinks.  I decided I didn't like it for two
reasons.  First, it requires more complicated rules (can a row cross
over itself?  If so, can a row "share" stones with itself?), but more
importantly, when 2 or more Kinks are allowed, it gets harder to
visualize the goal/threats.  Also, the number of stones in a winning
row will be very high, and you have to be continually counting stones
in various rows in order to assess threats.  This seemed to break the
"flow" of the game so I abandoned it.

2.  "Generalized" Kink.  The idea here is that each "row", which can
now be a snake like in Squirm, gets a score.  The score of a row is
the number of stones in the snake minus the number of Kinks in the
snake.  First player to achieve a certain threshold score wins.  So
you are awarded for "straightness", but at the same time, your rows
can twist and turn all over the place.  An interesting concept, but of
course you spend most of the game counting and calculating scores of
potential positions, and the "poetry of play" is lost entirely.

Which brings me to a thought: the reason that the Squirm inventor kept
the board small is probably to keep that annoying counting to a
minimum.

Glad you like the game (and King's Assassin as well).
