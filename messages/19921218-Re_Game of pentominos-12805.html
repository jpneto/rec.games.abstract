After several tries I gave up a combinatorial analysis of the game of
pentominos. Would someone point me to a reference, or briefly explain
how one could compute the total number of solutions for a grid of a
given size (6x10, 5x12, 4x15, 3x20).

I saw a paper once that reported the number of solutions to each of
these rectangle sizes. It used a heavily optimized machine code
program to exhaustively search for all solutions. I remember that for
the 3x20 case there are only two solutions barring reflections and
rotations. These are quite easy to find by hand. The number of
solutions for the 6x10 case was quite large, but I don't recall the
number. I also don't recall the title or author of the paper.

I can't give an authoritative reference, but according to
some notes I made back in my young &amp; innocent days when I used to note
information without references, there are:
    2  3x20 solutions
 2339  6x10 solutions
 1010  5x12 solutions
  368  4x15 solutions

If your pentominoes are 3-dimensional (i.e. each could be constructed by
joining 5 cubes together) rather than 2-dimensional, you can also form a
3x4x5 rectangular prism from the 12 pentominoes.

Gee, this must be my lucky month! I like pentominoes, wrote a program
once (who didn't) and I rank them right up there along with life,
rubik's cube and tiled squares (See: tiling problem in this group :-)


C.J.Bouwkamp, a professor here at the TUE has computed all solutions
to this prism as well as to "the steps" which is a three dimensional
staircase. He's just as mad about pentominoes as I am.

The catalogues are:

"Catalogue of solutions to the rectangular 3x4x5 pentomino problem"
C.J.Bouwkamp, Eindhoven University of Technology.

"Packing the steps with solid pentominoes"
C.J.Bouwkamp, Eindhoven University of Technology.

The books are available here, but not in "computerised" format.


By the way, has anybody ever tried to write a program to compute all
(N+1)-ominoes from the set of N-ominoes? It's not difficult:
Just take one N-omino at a time and fit an extra square onto it. This
produces one extra (N+1)-omino. Fit a square on all possible positions,
(just "roll" it along the edge) then proceed with the next N-omino.
This leaves you with a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>bag<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of (N+1)-ominoes, of which you now have to
make a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>set<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (remove multiple copies).
It would be smart to check for multiples right at the start though...

It would take a lot of computation, but not an awful lot of time.
