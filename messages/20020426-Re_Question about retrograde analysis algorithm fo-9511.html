If there is an overall rule about how many repeats there can be, so that
the game actually has no infinite move chains, you can "terminalize" all
of the repeating positions by having the states keep track of how they
were reached.  I.e., convert {X&gt;Y, Z&gt;Y, Y&gt;X, Z&gt;X} to
{X&gt;XY, XY&gt;XYX, XYX&gt;XYXY, XYXY&gt;XYXYX (terminal, score=1),
                         XYXY&gt;XYXYZ, XYXYZ&gt;XYXYZY (terminal, score=2),
       XY&gt;XYZ, ...
 Z&gt;ZY, ...
 Y&gt;YX, ...
 Y&gt;YZ, ...
}

So, the "Y" state is expanded into 19 different states internally (if I
have counted correctly), 10 of which are terminal, and 9 of which are
not yet "long enough" to end the game.  These states do not have any
loopiness, so they can be analyzed normally.

This seems like a very good way in theory, but in practice, the number
of states would expand tremendously.

I wonder if there is a practical way once all positions which are part
of cyclical chains are identified.  Could this type of state expansion
be applied to only part of an endgame database?  For example, in the
conventional retrograde analysis algorithm, the last step is that
after N iterations of the retrograde analysis (where N depends on the
possible range of values for each position), any position which has
not attained a final value is set to 0 (for draw).  Presumably, these
last positions have not attained their final value because they are
parts of cyclical chains or positions from which any move ultimately
leads to a cyclical chain.  Would it be mathematically valid to apply
the state expansion to these positions only?  And how would it work
since the expanded state may include positions with values?
