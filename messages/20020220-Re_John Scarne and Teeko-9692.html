One of my great finds at a used book store was "Scarne on Teeko" for a buck
and a quarter.  The book was published in 1955.  I had never heard of the
game.

As you note, it seems to have been very popular.  The last page of the book
discusses how "Teeko is Rapidly Sweeping the World".  What caused it to drop
in popularity?  Was some strategy discovered that rendered the game
uninteresting?
