For my Ph.D thesis, I have investigated (the literature on) a large
number of strategic games. For most games I have been able to obtain
all the information I need, except for Chinese Chess, Scrabble and Bridge.

I would appreciate any pointers to information regarding the following;

2. The state-of-the-art in Scrabble. Here I have heard rumors both that
  the strongest programs outperform human players, as well as rumors that
  the strongest humans still have the edge.
  Which programs are currently considered to be the best.

  From what I've heard, I think state-of-the-art in Scrabble focuses
  mostly on offense, not on defense. I've heard claims to the effect of 
  "This program averages 375 points per game" - well, it sure wouldn't
  be able to get that total against me! I'm not saying I'd beat it, I
  probably wouldn't, but it is quite easy to hold the totals down.

  My point is, it would be quite possible for a Scrabble program to be
  able to claim a higher average than is seen in human tournament play, and
  yet still lose to strong human players.

  I think the best Scrabble programs use a 1-move lookahead, with heuristics
  (like, Don't leave an open triple score) for defense rather than a 
  search. In my mind, there are several open questions regarding optimal
  play that I've not seen addressed, although that may just be 'cause I
  haven't heard about them.
