Christian, here's the problem in a nutshell.  Some people take game
science seriously. You clearly do not, and your outlandish Sygo
claims, which I'm still going to get to, are offensive. 

All designers are given to outlandish claims now and again.  Goes with
the territory.  Normally someone informs you of your folly and that's
the end of it.  The difference in your case is that after I prove the
folly of your "50/50 convergence" nonsense, you completely duck the
proof, and then weeks later crawl under Omar's burqa, and start
spewing the EXACT SAME SHIT.

This "50/50 convergence" shit isn't even a holy grail.  It's simply
gibberish.  

Your other outlandish Sygo claim, that Sygo perfect play can't even be
reasoned about, will also be demonstrated to be horse shit.  I'm tired
of your illusionism.  It was obnoxious in the previous, rga
discussion, and now we have your grotesque encore performance under
Omar's burqa.
