Greg, I'm sure I speak for all when I say your efforts are highly
appreciated and have contributed tremendously to bring an ad
hoc contest to the point where it is, which is certainly already
farther than I had dared to hope for. If it becomes the succes
we may now expect it to be, it will be to a large degree thanks
to you :)

Hear, hear.  Greg has not only been invaluable to the contest but in helping
bring abstract games to the public, including many of mine.

Greg's Colonnade program is the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Colonnade program.

Well golly, thanks for all the accolades.  As Martin Samuel put it:

"You crazy fool ... ever heard the expression, 'Get a life'?"

You wouldn't know it, but I'm actually trying to reduce my backlog so
that I have time for
other things (like family, filing my taxes, and all the other things I
should be doing).  Oh right,
and perhaps have a little more time to spend to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> some of these
games.

I can't always predict what project I'll be doing next, as it seems to
take on a life of its own
and the list of things to do to improve Axiom keeps on growing.  I
don't like having unfinished projects
yet I seem to have way too many.  If I could, I would happily retire
and spend time on all my pet projects.

And if you happen to be a designer, and I've never programmed one of
your games, please don't take offense,
I can't get to them all and I seem to be driven by a force I can't
control! :)  Mea Culpa!
