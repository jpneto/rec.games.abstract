Often people do not take enough time to analyze the context.
They just quote as if the quotes are synonym of truth.
Game design IS NOT a science. There is nothing "cumulative" in game design. So we can not stand upon the shoulders of giants in designing games. In science and technology where the knowledge is cumulative yes we have no choice then starting from what was done. We could not invent a motor functionning with salted water or hydrogene for example without having any knowledge in mechanical engineering.

There is no shoulders of giants in game design. First because there is no giants in game design. All those called giants did one thing : they summarized what was done! That`s it. Few invented what we call wrongfuly new games. None of those games was really new. 
Each game is specific.
Each mechanics vary depending on which game you applied to.
What is a huge mistake in game X could be improvement in game Y.
Game design is more art than science.
Game design could use science, technology, mathematics, graph theory BUT it has nothing to do with science, technology, mathematics or graph theory.
Corey Clark is DUMB too DUMB to understand what a game and more specifically what an abstract game is.
Games ARE NOT mathematical objects!!! It is like saying that the cryptography is mathematical object. Any field (art, medecine, economy, sociology, and so on) could be formalised and analysed using mathematical tools. That does not make those fields mathematical objects.
Cryptography was out of the mathematical field until we discovered how useful are the prime numbers (how difficult is reversing the multiplication) to encrypt messages.
Sophisticated games were created 2000 or 3000 years ago.
Maybe before even the invention of the writing let alone the mathematics.

Originality is not what is required from any game.
There are lot of new inventions very original but unuseful. Fancy inventions! there is even an award for those inventions.
There are improvements of existing inventions which are almost labeled as revolutions!!!
Been original you could be in the way you solve an existing problem. If you invent a procedure similar to the pie rule you are not inventing something really new. But if your invention is the best way to balance a game then you could claim originality! 
I`m not english native.
But I can post 20 pages or more in french about this subject.

Ps : I was banished for a month on bgg that`s why I posted here.
