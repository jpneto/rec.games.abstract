Major revision, possibly turning this into a decent game:

After a placement, any two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones must share at least one orthogonally adjacent, like-colored neighbor. No other placement restrictions are used.

On their turn, a player must place a stone or pass.

The game ends when both players pass in succession.

A player's score is the number of placements on empty stones, without the above restriction, that they would have to make in the final position in order to form a winning chain. The player with the lowest score wins. In the event of a tie, whoever passed first wins. Passing first can be indicated by taking possession of a special token called "button".

Komi can be used instead of the pie rule to balance the game. Note that if a player forms a winning chain before the end, their score is 0 and their opponent's score is arguably infinite, although it can be given a finite value to improve the effectivenes of komi if the need arises. Reasonable values in this case might be the number of empty points and the number of moves to form a winning chain before the opponent's last move, perhaps with a fixed penalty added to it.

This idea might work as a general pattern-building game system as well. Like here, placements that prevent the opponent from building the winning pattern (for some convenient definition of "prevent": on the whole board, with any group...) would be banned.

The resulting hybrid connection-territory games are to connection games what territory games are to annihilation games: they provide a scoring method to determine a winner on points when no sweeping victory has been claimed.
