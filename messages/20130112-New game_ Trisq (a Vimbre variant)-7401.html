Trisq is a Vimbre variant played with special trapezium-shaped pieces.

Trisq entry on BGG: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136037/trisq">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/136037/trisq</a>

All existing square board connection games with the Slither placement restriction  need an extra rule to prevent draws: Slither has a movement rule, Quentin has a territory rule, Vimbre has a capture rule and Scware has the Symple growing mechanism.

I became interested in the idea of half pieces because they seemed a good way to get rid of that extra rule. At some point during my tests, I thought the trapezium-shaped pieces would do the trick if players were allowed to place two pieces per turn. Alas, this was not the case, but the smallest draw in that version was a bizarre loop formation requiring no less than 32 pieces intertwined in an almost hypnotic way:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LqBJmyqnCpDopdHrMAUT6Ieu5nSantRwFjl5jEVdlhI/edit">https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LqBJmyqnCpDopdHrMAUT6Ieu5nSantRwFjl5jEVdlhI/edit</a>

It's practically impossible that this position is reached in an actual game, so that version is already more than playable. However, I don't like draws in general, let alone in connection games, and, with double moves and illegal diagonal connections, the game was already becoming similar to Vimbre. The solution was clear: I had to embrace this similarity and make it drawless by using the flipping mechanic from that game as well.

As a result, Trisq is now a simple Vimbre variant, but I think the special trapezium pieces make the game different enough as to justify a stand-alone release.
