This is a variant of Mark Steere's new game "Atoll".
. . .
The winning criterion is almost identical to that of "Y",
except that the Y criterion is specifically adapted to
figures with an ODD number of sides, (Y has 3, but
variants with 5, 7 etc are simple).  Atoll, however,
is specifically adapted to boards with an EVEN number.

Mark is to be strongly congratulated on discovering
the natural criterion for even-sided boards!

Bill, you seem to have stopped short of fully generalizing Atoll's
central, defining principle.  It's not just a question of how many
sides a board has.  It's also a question of how many segments a
board's perimeter is divided into.

In both Atoll and Hexatoll each side is divided into two segments, but
there's no reason to stop there.  In both cases the sides could be
further divided into 4 segments or 6 segments, and so on.  Generally
speaking, Atoll can be played on any even sided board with any even
number of perimeter segments (8 or higher).

So for example you could have a 9 point per side hexagon surrounded by
24 islands of length 2, or 48 islands of length 1.  I would call these
variations Atoll-24 and Atoll-48 to avoid having to create new names
for the myriad variations.

Thus, I propose "HEXATOLL", ...
