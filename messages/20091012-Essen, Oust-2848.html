Oust is a two year old game of mine that turns out to have
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>phenomenal<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> gameplay.  It mushroomed on three live play sites in the
past two weeks after a long period of dormancy.  I was as surprised as
anyone.  I stumbled onto it at Igfip after member Christina
recommended it for implementation.

Oust is number one out of 100 games on igGameCenter if you look at the
stats for the past week.  And it's only been there for four days!

Part of that is the novelty and me participating in about half of the
games.  But even at that it's truly a phenomenon.  I've been doing
this for 17 years and I've never had a response anything like this.

Essen is the world's biggest game fair in the world's greatest game
playing country - Germany!!

I'm going to Essen from October 22 to 25 mainly to visit with friends
- proprietors of the big European sites that carry my games and fellow
world famous designers.  Everyone will be there.  It was too late to
get a table for this year but I'll be easy to spot.  I'll be wearing a
T-shirt with a big MSG logo, front and back, and carrying a Go board
under my arm.  I want to play Oust and only Oust.  See you there!
