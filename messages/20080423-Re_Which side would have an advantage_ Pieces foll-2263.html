Anyhow, out of development of Near Chess came the question about how
pieces following Near Chess rules would do against those following
normal chess rules.  To answer this question,  Near vs Normal Chess
was created to pit pieces following Near Chess rules against those
following normal chess rules.

Why?  Nearchess is won by king capture instead of checkmate
(which implies that a king can move into check, and indeed
may have to do so in what would otherwise be a stalemate).
Why apply the normal chess rule to both sides?  

BTW, Rule three of Near Chess contains an error.

"3. Game is won by capturing the opponent's king, rather 
 than checkmating it. This eliminates stalemate."

The above should be "This eliminates most stalemates."
It is possible to create a position where a player has 
no legal move even if the king is allowed to move into 
check.  It isn't likely to come about in normal play, 
but it is possible.
