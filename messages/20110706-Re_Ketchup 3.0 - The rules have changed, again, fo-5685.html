There's no twist, Christian.  You spent eight months twaddling on about how

No Mark, that was you. While the wording may be less than perfect (be
sure to count that one :), I did explain what I meant and what I did
not mean. I did not mean what you insist I mean, but being the fuel
for a debate between Mark and His intentionally distorted
interpretation of my words is less than fruitful. For me at least.

I wouldn't deny that, but again: it_is_not_what_I_said.
I said: "its perfectly working and aestetically pleasing balancing
mechanism".

And I can well imagine that readers are as tired of this discussion as
I am. Your efforts have certainly not affected Sygo in any negative
way. Thanks for that :)
