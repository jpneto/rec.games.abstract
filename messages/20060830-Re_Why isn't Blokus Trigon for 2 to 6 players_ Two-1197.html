<br><blockquote type=cite>Getting back to the point of this post, I often require twelve

<br>relevant to the original enquiry here, OC.&nbsp; They must be short,
<br>SINGLE words, and reasonably everyday words, (not interior
<br>decorators' horrors!), preferably words that don't have a meaning
<br>other than colours, like most of these below.
<br>
<br>I have:-
<br>
<br>black white grey brown red orange yellow green blue purple &amp; pink;
<br>
<br>that's eleven, all good, proper colour-words. But I can't find
<br>a clear-cut twelfth.&nbsp; Silver &amp; Gold are too metally, and too close
<br>to white &amp; yellow.&nbsp; Violet is too close to purple, (and anyway is
<br>a flower name, though I DO allow (also-a-fruit) orange, as you see).
<br>Tan, khaki etc are too close to brown, and crimson, scarlet etc
<br>too close to red.
<br>
<br>So, what is to be the twelfth colour???
<br>
<br>I await your votes and suggestions!

<br>Blue and/or green could be split into light and dark.
