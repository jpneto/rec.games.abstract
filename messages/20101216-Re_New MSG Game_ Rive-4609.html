Almost  :)  Everyone is having trouble with my rulesheet, as often
(usually?) happens, and I'm redoing it as we speak.  It's a tremendously
simple concept, as simple now as when I first noticed it.  Once you
understand it, you'll kick yourself.  Then you'll kick me for the ambiguity
in how I tried to express it.

White to move, or black for that matter. No isolated placement is
possible, so the player to move must connect to the 1-group at C1, but
in doing so he also connects to a 2-group.

So what's the legal move here?

In this case, all of the moves are legal.  The largest group your stone
connects to cannot be smaller than two.

I'll post the hopefully clarified rule sheet in a bit.
