I don't have time to read a twenty page treatise, but I think "4D" might be a tad misleading.  I have a game that I thought was 4D but it turned out to be 3D.  I think.  It could arguably be 2D.  It's been a few years.

I agree it doesn't seem to be 4D but with the 2 holes in the board being the same hole, it folds through the 3rd dimension. It's also an anchor board, which again means it's folded through the 3rd dimension. It's apparently a 2D surface you're playing on, though. 

In my previous reply, I neglected to point out the knight move diagram, which also shows the 4D nature of the board. The piece moves are not fully 4D, with some exceptions, like the rook, for reasons of human comprehensibility. The board could equally be represented with 4 3D 4x4x4 boards in a straight line, with pieces moving within one 3D board, or from corresponding point to corresponding point across the 4 boards. Perhaps that image will let you better see the exact nature of the game. It's easier to play, though, by laying out a 4x4 arrangement of 4x4 2D boards.
