|&gt; I think you can not get away by making some sort of Minimal Initial

But before agreeing on some sort of MIR, you don't have any initial rules.
So why is it more difficult to start a game without rules than it is to
agree on a MIR?

There is a subtil difference, IMO.
When you are discussing the MIR one is not playing yet.
But if you start playing, without rules, than you are playing.

And even with an initial ruleset, you have to assume higher Rules
such as 'The rules are to be followed' etc.

Not really. `All players must obey the Rules' must be in the MIR.
But later it could in principle be changed to:
`All players must obey the Rules, but Rule 45 does not have to obeyed by Stein'
 
In Agora Nomic we had a discussion on the question of higher Rules, and it
led almost to a schism.
 
It all comes down to `keep all Players happy' as the one and only higher
Rule necessary.
