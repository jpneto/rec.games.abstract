The fantasy rules committee is looking for new members. Round 31 will begin
in a couple of days. The theme will be "haiku". Subscribe now! (Instructions
for how to subscribe are below).

Here is some general info about the game, mostly shamelessly cribbed and
adapted from the archives. Thanks particularly to Storm and Oerjan.

Historical Note:

The FR Committee began life as a registered committee of the Nomic World
on-line game, but has survived the disbanding of Nomic World and
continues as a fully independent game.  The objective is to be the last
player able (or willing) to post a legal Fantasy Rule.  Fantasy rules are
accepted as valid provided they are consistent with themselves and all
previous rules. Previous rounds have included poetry, ascii-graphics,
4D-Scrabble, logic puzzles, creation of new games and other worlds and so on.

The FRC archives are at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/frc/">ftp://ftp.nvg.unit.no/pub/frc/</a>
Read them to get a feeling of how the game is/can be. Here is an early
(round 7, from Jun 1993) and atypically short example.

1) All subsequent fantasy rules must be shorter than any other valid rule
posted in the current round.  For the purposes of this rule, "shorter"
means "has fewer characters".
2) "Don't use the word 'nim.'"
3) "Rules make sense."
4) [was invalid]
5) "BE YOU"
6) Win!
7) B

The Judge wrote:
  (As he didn't write "be", he probably got the victory
this time. I, in my infinite liberality, accept "B" as a useful
acronym for "Be".)
  As to why it's legal: It is the shortest possible sensible rule
and must therefore, by 1) and 3), win. So it satisfies 6).
  I am NOT going to accept the empty proposal. Zen doesn't make
sense.

Of course some degree of cooperation is required. The rule "Only rules
posted by me are valid" would win but would not be fun. To encourage a
respect for the spirit of the game, the judge awards positive or negative
Style Points to rules. The person with the most style points at the end
of the round is declared the Wizard for the next round. The person who won
the round (by posting the last valid rule) is declared the Judge.
