|A few remarks are in order. (1) The game of chess is not included since
|a separate World Computer Chess Championship (the 13th WCCC) is held in
|Reykjavik, Iceland from August 13 to August 21, 2005. (2) The game of
|Renju, claimed to be solved, is still welcome since we have not seen a
|fully-operational program on internet that plays perfectly.

Renju solved? I heard that a simplified version of Renju, without all
the restrictions and protocols, had been solved, but official Renju?
Who says this? Is there a website?

Thanks for any info!
