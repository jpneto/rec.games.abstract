the following is a proposed initial Ruleset which has been developed
for play over USENET.  there is some significant added complexity here
over the standard Rules which has been introduced mainly because it is
anticipated that a USENET-based Game will be larger, longer, and more
diffuse than the standard Initial Rules are capable of coping with, as
our experiences at Agora have demonstrated.  most of the added
complexity is to prevent the Speaker from being overwhelmed with
excess work, and to insure that complete and accurate records of Game
Events are kept from the onset of the Game.

suggestions for modifications of these Rules may be made by mailing
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:usenet-nomic@poverty.bloomington.in.us">"usenet-nomic@poverty.bloomington.in.us"</a>.  to subscribe to this list,
which is intended for settling the preliminaries to starting a game,
send a request to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:usenet-nomic-request@poverty.bloomington.in.us">"usenet-nomic-request@poverty.bloomington.in.us"</a>.

i am willing to offer my services as First Speaker of any Game based
on this Ruleset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules marked as "Priv" are Privileged (see Rule 1-5).

TITLE 1.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.  

1-1.    The Rules shall be gathered into a collection of
        numbered Titles, each of which shall consist of zero
        or more numbered Sections.  No Title or Section may be
        numbered less than 1; no two Titles or two Sections
        within the same Title may have the same Number.  Title
        and Section Numbers may be fractional, if necessary.  

1-2.    An individual Rule may be cited within another Rule by
        specifying its Title and Section numbers (e.g. Rule 1-1).  

1-3.    These Rules shall govern all activities of those
Priv    Entities described within these Rules.  No Entity
        described within these Rules may act in a manner
        prohibited by the Rules while that Entity is under the
        jurisdiction of the Rules.  

1-4.    Any action which is not explicitly prohibited by the
Priv    Rules is permitted without regulation.  

1-5.    Certain Rules may, in accordance with other Rules, be
Priv    designated as Privileged.  Privileged Rules always
        take precedence over Unprivileged Rules, even if
        another Rule states otherwise.  

1-6.    If two or more Rules are found to be in conflict with
        one another, the Rule least recently enacted or
        amended takes precedence, unless one of the Rules
        involved explicitly claims or yields precedence to the
        others, in which case that provision shall govern
        precedence.  If, however, two or more of the Rules in
        conflict claim precedence over one another, or yield
        precedence to one another, the chronological method
        shall again govern precedence.  

1-7.    For the purpose of Rule 1-6, the Initial Rules shall
        be considered to have been sequentially enacted in the
        order they appear, by Title and by Section within each
        Title.  

1-8.    No Rule shall have retroactive effect or application.
Priv    No Rule shall have any legal force prior to the moment
        it is enacted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.  

1-9.    There shall be an Officer, called the Rulekeeper, who
        shall maintain a record of all the Rules. 

        a) Whenever a Rule is enacted, this record shall be
           annotated with a notation indicating the date
           and time the Rule was enacted and the means of
           its enactment. 

        b) Whenever a Rule is repealed, this record shall
           be annotated with a notation indicating that
           that Rule has been repealed, the date and time
           of the repeal, and the means of repeal. The text
           of the repealed Rule need not be included in the record. 

        c) Whenever a Rule is amended, the record shall be
           annotated with a notation that the Rule has been
           amended, the date and time of amendment, and the
           means of amendment.  The text of the original
           form of the Rule need not be included in the record. 

        d) Whenever a Rule's Privileged Status is changed,
           the record shall be annotated with a notation
           that the Rule's Privilege Status has been
           changed, its former Privilege Status, the date
           and time of the change, and the means of the change. 

TITLE 2.  RULE CHANGES. 

2-1.    A Rule Change shall be exactly one of the following: 
Priv    a) the enactment of a new Rule, 
        b) the repeal of an existing Rule,  
        c) the amendment of an existing Rule, or 
        d) the change of an existing Rule's Privilege (from
           Unprivileged to Privileged, or Privileged to
           Unprivileged). 
        No other type of Rule Change is legal.  

2-2.    A Rule Change which enacts a new Rule shall state the
Priv    Title and Section Numbers of the new Rule; if the
        Title does not already exist, the Rule Change shall
        also state the name of the new Title.  No new Rule may
        be enacted with the same Title and Section number of
        any previously enacted Rule, whether or not the
        previous Rule still exists.  A Rule Change which does
        not comply with this Rule shall have no effect.  

2-3.    A Rule Change may affect any portion of the Rules,
Priv    including those Rules pertaining to Rule Changes.  

2-4.    It shall never be completely impossible to change the
Priv    Rules. Any Rule Change which would result in this
        state of affairs shall have no effect.  

2-5.    No Rule may be changed except as the direct result of
Priv    the application of another Rule, or the adoption of a
        Proposal.  

2-6.    A Privileged Rule may not be changed, or an
Priv    Unprivileged Rule made Privileged, except as the
        direct result of the application of another Privileged
        Rule, or the adoption of a Proposal which required at
        least twice as many votes in favor as opposed to be adopted.  

TITLE 3.  PLAYERS.  

3-1.    A Player is a person who has been registered to play
        Nomic.  A Player may not be registered or deregistered
        except as provided by the Rules.  

3-2.    A person may, at any time, announce eir intent to play
Priv    Nomic, and thus become registered as a Player.  Such
        announcement must be made such that all current
        Players may receive it.  

3-3.    A Player may, at any time, announce that e no longer
Priv    intends to play Nomic, and thus cease to be registered
        as a Player.  

3-4.    While a person is registered as a Player, e is bound
Priv    by the Rules of Nomic, and must abide by them at all times.  

3-5.    There shall be an Officer, called the Registrar, who
        shall maintain a list of all registered Players.  

TITLE 4.  PROPOSALS.  

4-1.    There shall exist an Officer, known as the Speaker,
Priv    who shall be responsible for administering the process
        of making and voting upon Proposals.  

4-2.    Any Player may make a formal Proposal to change the
        Rules.  Such a Proposal shall contain one or more Rule
        Changes, and shall be submitted to the Speaker.  Only
        Players may make Proposals.  

4-3.    The Speaker shall assign each Proposal e receives a
        Proposal Number.  E shall then distribute the Proposal
        to all Players, after which the Players shall then
        Vote upon it.  

4-4.    The first Proposals shall be numbered 1, and each
        subsequent Proposal shall receive the next higher integer.  

4-5.    Any Proposal which is adopted shall take effect in the
        exact form it was Voted upon.    

4-6.    No Proposal may be adopted without a
        properly-conducted Vote in which it has received the
        required number of Votes and in which Quorum has been
        acheived.  

4-7.    Unless otherwise specified, a Proposal shall be
        adopted if and only if it receives more FOR Votes than
        AGAINST Votes.  

4-8.    A Proposal containing a Rule Change which in any way
Priv    changes a Privilged Rule, or which makes an
        Unprivileged Rule Privileged,  shall be adopted if and
        only if it receives more than twice as many FOR Votes
        as AGAINST Votes.  

4-9.    When a Proposal is adopted, the Rule Changes it
        contains shall be applied to the Rules in the order
        they appear in the Proposal.    

4-10.   There shall be an Officer, called the Scribe, who

5-1.    A Vote shall commence at the moment the Proposal to be
        Voted upon is distributed to the Players, and shall
        last for a Voting Period of seven days.  

5-2.    Quorum is defined as 20% of the registered Voters at
        the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period.
        However, Quorum may never be less than three.  For a
        Vote to meet Quorum, at least this many Voters must vote.  

5-3.    Each Voter registered at the beginning of the Voting
        Period shall have one Vote.  

5-4.    All Players, other than the Speaker, are Voters.  The
        Speaker is not a Voter and may not Vote.  

5-5.    An individial Vote may be either FOR or AGAINST a
        Proposal, but not both.  Votes must be clear and

5-6.    Only those votes cast between the beginning and the
        end of the Voting Period on a given Proposal are
        valid; all others are not.  

TITLE 6.  JUDGEMENTS.  

6-1.    There shall exist an Officer, known as the Clerk, who
        shall be responsible for administering the operation
        of the Courts.  

6-2.    If a Player believes an Action to have been in

6-3.    The Clerk, upon receiving a Petition in accordance
        with 6-2, shall assign it a number and select a Judge

        subsequent Petition shall receive the next higher integer.  

6-5.    The Judge of a Petition shall be selected at random
        from all Players not barred or recused on that Petition.  

6-6.    The submitter of a Petition is barred from being
        assigned to Judge it.  

6-7.    If there are no Players not barred or recused from a
        given Petition, all Players recused on that Petition
        shall again be considered eligible for selection.  If
        there are still no eligible Players, all Players
        barred, excluding the Player submitting the Petition,
        shall be considered eligible for selection.  

6-8.    Once a Judge has been assigned, e has seven days from
        the date of distribution of the Petition to render eir

6-10.   A Judgement is one of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
        Judge may choose to include reasons or arguments along
        with eir Judgement, but such reasons and arguments are
        not part of the Judgement. If the Judge chooses to
        include reasons and arguments along with eir
        Judgement, these shall be distributed along with the
        Judgement itself.  

6-11.   All Judgements shall be made in accordance to the
        Rules.  If the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or
        unclear, the Judge shall consider game custom and the
        spirit of the Game before applying other standards.  

6-12.   The Clerk shall, in addition to eir other duties,
        maintain a complete historical record of all Petitions

        in which the Vote was cast.  

7-4.    The Player who proposes a Proposal shall receive 10
        Points if the Proposal is adopted, and shall lose 10
        Points if the Proposal is rejected.  This award or

        for that Proposal.

        exceed a score of 100 Points in any given Round wins

        immediately take place: 
        a) If there is a single winner, e shall become the
           Speaker for the next Round.  If there is more
           than one winner, the current Speaker shall
           select one of them at random to become the
           Speaker for the next Round.  If there are no
           Winners, the current Speaker shall be the
           Speaker for the next Round. 
        b) The Scores of all Players are reset to zero. 
        c) The next Round of the Game is then begun.

9-3.    If the Office of Speaker would otherwise not be
        filled, the Player with the highest Score shall be

        fill a vacant Office.  

9-5.    An Officer may resign eir Office at any time by
        informing the Speaker of eir resignation.  However,
        the Player currently holding the Office of Speaker may
        never resign any Office e holds in this fashion.  

9-6.    If the Rules require an Officer to maintain any sort
        of records, then those Records must be made available
        for the perusal of every Player, unless the Rules
