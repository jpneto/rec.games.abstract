I need the info reg. the following game. This is somewhat similar
to nim. Played between two players. There are two heaps of coins of
size m,n. Each player may take x coins from any of the heap or from
both the heaps such that x &gt; 0. Can you please give me the details
about this game? I have a solution for this game. But I donno the
complete details of this game.

... It seems that we get the P-positions by starting with P_0 = {0, 0} and
adding recursively for k &gt;= 1

P_k = {smallest positive integer not used, same + k}

This gives: {1, 2}, {3, 5}, {4, 7}, {6, 10}, {8, 13}, {9, 15},
{11, 18}, {12, 20}, {14, 23}, {16, 26}, {17, 28}, ...

I guess it's tricky to find a closed form expression for these.

to which David desJardins remarked:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think these are the pairs {floor(k*phi), floor(k*phi^2)} for
k=1,2,3,..., where phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2.  These have the well-known
property that the k-th pair has gap size k, and every natural number
occurs exactly once in the sequence.

By pure twist of fate, I happened upon this game in "Exploring Mathematics
With Your Computer", by Arthur Engel, page 169.  It is called "Wythoff's
Game".  An exercise on page 171 confirms David desJardins statement, and
suggests it can be proven using "Beatty's Theorem" about complementary
sequences.

Hope that helps,
