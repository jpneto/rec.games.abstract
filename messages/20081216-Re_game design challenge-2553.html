Well.

I'm finally beginning to catch up on backlogged articles/emails.

There's an argument to be made in favor of the idea that

Indeed so!  And in the world of Go, that is very nearly the case.
Because the game is fine-grained in terms of final outcome,
(the final score on the board is about as likely to be anything
between plus and minus 30, between roughly-equal players),
this leaves scope for...

(a) considerable tinkering with "komi", (numerical compensation
                                 for the second-moving player); and
(b) the opportunity to allow for (fairly rare) draws by means
                           of getting the komi "exactly right".

It is interesting to note that there may be two somewhat
different komis.  One is the "perfect single figure", known
only to God, that would make a draw from exactly perfect play;
and the other is "practical komi" which results in about
equal numbers of wins and losses for either colour.
These two figures are almost certainly not the same,
due to the fallibility of real human players.

Strangely, the Go world seems to go out of its way to AVOID ALL
possibility of draws, which is odd, and not at all like
oriental culture in general, where concensus and "market share"
tend to dominate thinking.  It is OC much more like American
culture, where in commerce and sport, "winner-take-all" views
tend to dominate, as witness the extreme lengths in baseball,
basketball and gridiron football to expunge draws.

And yet in Go-scoring ideals it tends to be the other way round!
Odd.  And IMHO an opportunity badly missed.  It would be great
to arrange komi so that it would allow draws infrequently but
significantly.  Indeed, I often think that for amateur players,
where the scores tend to fluctuate more randomly, it would be
a great idea to use a "thick komi" that allows a wider interval
of board-score results to be counted as draws.  But this is OT.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
So, what would draws in an ideal game be like?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The above remarks suggest it might be similar to Go-like games,
that is, games where there is more than just a win/loss outcome,
but a range of "scored" outcomes.  There aren't many of these,
but there are some.  Games like "Amazons", where at game end
the loser has run out of legal moves, but the winner still
has some (again, say, anything from one to twenty) left over.

So, that would be a start.  Alas, there aren't too many others,
though perhaps some could be artificially adapted.  For example,
in a connection game, where one player can win so easily that,
at game's end, he could claim victory by allowing his opponent
some number of "free moves", and still win.
It's not much of an idea, but perhaps worth thinking about.

Perhaps an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Could be.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
So, my challenge to you is to design such a game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm working on it!   No luck yet, however.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I'm curious to see what gameplay would be like for a game with a
single known draw.Conservative players might play toward the draw,
before one breaks away when he sees an opportunity for advantage.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed!   I suspect that would be quite common.  It could even
lead to a "chicken"-like element in games, which I have spoken
of before here.  Both players getting closer and closer to
explosive instability, till one cracks and commits to something.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Having a single known draw might increase the clarity in the game,
because players could use knowledge of the draw as a kind of guide
to play, as in the "conservative" play example mentioned above.
But I could be completely wrong.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No; I think these are all good observations.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Is it possible to design a game where draws are possible,
but nobody except perfect players can ever get to it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That would actually be a good design specification.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I suppose it requires that nobody but perfect players
even be able to imagine a drawn state.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh no, not at all!  It could be very easy for anyone with basic
game knowledge to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>check<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that a certain position satisfies
the (maybe even unique) drawing conditions in the rules; but still
hugely difficult to actually achieve it.  Indeed there are hints
of NP-not-equal-P-ness to this.  (Don't read that aloud to fast!)

Hard to find but easy to verify.  That's essentially P =/= NP.

Also, Bill Taylor, if you read this:
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Hello there Nick!    :-)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I've noticed that you sprinkle your posts with design challenges.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, I'm glad you think so, because it's a laudable goal.
But I'm surprised you think so, because I can't think of
any particular design challenges I've sent out here!
Please recall and tell us of some, it sounds fun.

I know of many I've <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>worked on<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, but mostly they're kept to
games that Joao Neto and myself play privately.  Some are
design goals I've been very pleased indeed to work on, and
even pleased-er to have solved!  But I don't recall any on rga.

OC, it's become a bit dangerous to put out general ideas here,
because of a certain you-know-who, who shall remain nameless,
but has a distressing tendency to claim every good idea as
one of his own, and belittle all those which he can't!   ;-)

So until this poisonous viper changes his ways, or (better)
just buggers off, your general goal of co-operative construction
might be unattainable!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It might be a cool idea to compile a list of such challenges
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well great!  But I don't recall any.  Can YOU start a list for us?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Is there someplace where all the designers go to discuss
abstract game design?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

THIS is the place!  It has been a great place up till recently,
but now the waters have become poisoned, as happens all too
often on Usenet, alas.   Pity.
