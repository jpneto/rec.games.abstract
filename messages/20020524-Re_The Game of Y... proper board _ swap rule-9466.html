The same implementation (as on playsite) is in HEX on
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.littlegolem.net">www.littlegolem.net</a>. More interesting swap rule is:

A: black A:white A: black (all moves are created by A), B: move or swap

In Hex and other connection games (Twixt) where
the swap rule is often used, normally after Black
makes an opening play, White then chooses
whether to take this move as his own (swapping)
or simply let it be and move elsewhere.  However,
in this Zillions implementation, Black moves, then
White moves, and THEN White decides to swap colors.
(If White does swap, in effect this gives Black
the poorest first move possible, but of course it's
Black's turn again.)

That really doesn't sound right.  That would mean
that the same Player B (starting as White) would
make a White move, elect to swap, and then immediately
make a Black move, all while Player A does nothing.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, I must not have explained it clearly enough.  Player B is not making
two moves in a row.  Let me try again...

Player A moves first.  Let's pretend it's in the center hexagon.  Player
B decides Player A's move was very strong and he wants that move as his
own so he then moves next by placing a stone in what he believes to be
the worst possible hexagon.  Player B then exercises his option of
swapping colors.

Thus, it's now Player A's turn again although colors have been reversed.
Player A has the one stone in the poor position, Player B has the one
stone in the center hex and it's Player A's turn.

This is how the swap option is used in the Zillions implementation of
"Y" I downloaded last night.  I've never seen the swap option used this
way before and it doesn't really make sense to me.  Granted, Player A's
poorly positioned stone can never hurt him, but it seems easier to just
allow Player B to swap stones after Player A has placed it.  This is how
this swap rule is used when playing Hex at the PLAYSITE website, and
it's how I use it when playing Twixt with my friends.  Having Player B
place a second stone and THEN allow swapping seems unnecessary to me -
there's no reason for it.  (Or is there?)

I wasn't sure if the Zillions author who implemented "Y" simply was not
aware of the correct way to implement this swap rule, of if indeed "Y"
was played this way.  (Again, I may be missing something entirely.)
