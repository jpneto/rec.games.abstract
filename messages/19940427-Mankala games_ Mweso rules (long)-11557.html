Here are the rules to the Ugandan game of Mweso. This is a 
copy of an article by R.S.Shackell, published in the Uganda Journal
Vol2 p14 in 1934

I appologize in advance for the slightly stilted and racist language used in
places, but I guess that a colonialist of that time didn't know any better.

If you don't have a board, it is easy to improvise one. Or a traditional
method is to simply scoop a series of hollows in the earth or sand and
start playing.

R.S.Shackell, "Mweso - The Board Game", 1934 Uganda Journal Vol2 p14

If you have been in Uganda for any length of time and have not been too
unobservant, almost certainly you will have noticed at some time or
another a group of Africans seated round a board about eighteen inches
long and twelve wide, intent upon a fame played with little brown
pellets. If your curiosity has moved you to stand and watch them
closely you will, I imagine, have come away without any clear idea of
how the game was played but with, perhaps, a feeling of admiration for
the dexterity with which the players made their "moves". But if, on the
other hand, you have gone further and taken the trouble to learn the
game you will surely have come, like myself, to speculate as to its
origin and to wonder at the ingenuity of the untutored savage. I have
seen it played up and down the West Coast of Africa and inland, on the
East Coast and inland, and I have little doubt that its vogue, with
minor modifications, extends throughout tropical Africa. Where it
originated and when I cannot say, but it seems possible

     [Photo 1: not shown, but see fig 1 below]

Photograph No.1 shows an ordinary board obtainable for about a shilling
or so. More elaborate examples exist, some with feet, but whatever
degree of ornamentation or fineness of workmanship characterizes a
board, its fundamental plan remains unaltered. This plan, as the
photograph shows, consists of a rectangle roughly in the proportion 18
to 12, divided into thirty two equal rectangles. No particular wood
seems to be favoured for the making of the board, so long as it be
fairly soft and close grained; constant play soon gives it a patina all
its own.

The little brown pellets which are used as "men" are of a particular
kind. They are the seed of a tree known to the Baganda as Luiki, and to
scientists as Mesoneurum Welwitschianum. It is a strong woody climbing
plant which will often reach to the summit of a tree thirty feet high
or higher; in which case its main stem near the ground will be four
inches or so in diameter covered with a corky bark having large stumpy
spines shaped like the "horn" of a rhinoceros. The seeds are carried at
the ends of the upper shoots of the plant in pods, usually two to a pod
and fall to the ground when ripe, enclosed in these pods. If a shoot of
the plant grows outwards in a direction where it finds no support it
may bend over until it touches the ground and then "strikes" itself as
a blackberry bush will. There is a specimen about three miles out of
Kampala on the old Mubende road which has done this. On the West Coast
of Africa the plant is well distributed from Senegal to Angola, but
being of a slightly different variety

     [Photo 2. Imagine some bark, pods and a leaf here.]

So much for the board and men. Now for the game.

Each player has 32 men. The object of the game is to capture all the
opponent's men or so reduce them that he cannot move. The centre
horizontal line of the board divides it so that each player has two
rows each of eight squares. He may play only his own men on his own
side of the board and may not interfere with those of his opponents
except to count them or take them. When he takes any men from his
opponent a player adds them to his own men and thereafter plays them
exactly the same as his original 32.

Each player moves in turn. A move consists in taking up as many men as
are in any one square on a player's own side of the board (provided
there are two or more) and dropping them one by one in each succeeding
square, traveling in an anti-clockwise direction and starting from the
square next to the one from which the men were taken. If the last men
drops into an empty square the move is finished but if it drops into an
occupied square then that square is emptied and the move continued from
the next succeeding square. This process is repeated until the last man
in the hand falls into an unoccupied square. It should be noted that a
move cannot be started from a square containing only one man. This
means that when a player is reduced to sixteen men or less, should they
happen to be situated only one to a square, the game is lost. Of course
he may be reduced to only ten men, but provided that one square at
least contains two or more men he can still move and possibly win the
game.

The way in which an opponent's men are taken is easy to demonstrate on
a board but hard to describe. No men are ever taken from the board and
the whole 64 remain in play from the start to finish: they are merely
transferred from one side of the board to the other. When, during a
move, the last man from a player's hand drops into a square in the row
nearest the centre line containing one ore more men, and it so happens
that the two squares on his opponent's side of the board immediately
opposite are occupied, instead of continuing his move in the ordinary
way the player takes whatever number of men are in those two opponent's
squares and continues his move with them on his own side of the board.
But, and this is important, he does not start from where he left off
but from the square next to the one last left empty on his own side of
the board.

When this has been done the player's move may or may not be finished.
If the last of these captured men falls into an occupied square the
player continues his move in the ordinary way, unless it should happen
that this occupied square is in the row of squares nearest the centre
line and that the two squares of his opponent's half of the board
opposite are occupied: in which case he again takes what men are there
and proceeds to play them on his own side of the board starting from
the square next to the one that last left empty. It is thus possible
for a player by a combination of relayed moves and moves made with men
taken from his opponent to travel round his side of the board several
times before falling out of play through his last man falling into an
empty square. The skill of the game consists in working out the moves
well ahead so that the opponent's men are taken whilst as few openings
as possible are left to him.

        [The letters are from the notation used in the second article]

There is one complications to be mentioned: "Okutebuka" - "To go back".
In certain circumstances it is permissible to move back, i.e. in a
clockwise direction. In the diagram No. 1. it will be noticed that a
thickened line has been drawn round the four squares on the left hand
side of each player. If a player sees that the number of men (being two
or more of course) contained in one of the squares labeled A,B,S,T will
land him when traveling clockwise into one of the squares in his second
row (J-T) which is occupied and has two occupied squares of his
opponent immediately opposite he may move in a clockwise direction and
take the men. The men which he takes he then proceeds to distribute one
to each square in the usual way, starting from the square on the
anti-clockwise side of the square last left empty, (A,B,S or T as the
case may be), unless he finds that the number of men which he has taken
will, if started from the square in the clockwise side of the square
left empty land him in an occupied square in h

As mentioned above the game is won when the opponent cannot move
because he has no square containing two or more men. There is, however,
one coup which counts as a win. This coup is known in Luganda as
"Nkutemye" - "I have cut your head off". If a player, in one move
(including relayed move) succeeds in taking his opponent's men in
squares A and T, and J and H, he wins - "Nkutemye!"

It is hoped that the above running description of the fame is clear,
but for reference a set of rules is appended.

1. The Board. 
The board is divided into 32 squares in four rows of eight. The players
sit at the long sides of the board so that each has two rows of eight
squares before him.

2. The Men.
The game is played with 64 men, 32 for each player.

3. The object of the game.
The object of the game is to capture all the opponent's men but the
game stops when the opponent's men are so reduced in number that he
cannot move, or when all the men are taken from the squares at both
ends of the row in one move. This last coup is known as "Nkutemye" - "I
have cut your head off".

4. Commencement of the game.
Before the game proper starts each player distributes his men four to
each square in his first row. The object of this is to ensure that each
player has the correct number of men. Having checked this each player
proceeds to allot his men between the sixteen square on his own side of
the board as best pleases him. There is no rule as to the number which
may be placed in any square and any square may receive any number of
men or none at all. Thus a player may place his men like this:-

   0  0  3  3  3  3  0  0
   0  0  0  0  0  0  0 17

  2. This arrangement is known as "The seventeen game"

or he may choose any other arrangement he likes. In his own interest he
will not place men in squares in rows one and two which are opposite to
each other, as this is the position in which his opponent can take
them.

5. Choice of first move.
With the Baganda this is  a matter of mutual arrangement and they do
not usually bother to spin a coin or decide in any other arbitrary way.
In second a subsequent games the loser always starts.

6. The move.
A player moves by taking all the men which are in any one square
(provided there are two or more) and distributing them one at a time to
each successive square starting next to the one vacated and moving in
an anti-clockwise direction. It does not matter whether a square
traversed by the hand is occupied or vacant - each square receives one
man and no more. If the last man falls into a vacant square the move is
finished, but if it falls into a square already occupied the move is
relayed, i.e. the men in that square together with the one which has
just arrived are taken up and distributed one at a time to each
successive square, still moving in an anti-clockwise direction, and
starting from the square on the anti-clockwise side of the square just
vacated. (By anti-clockwise side of a square is meant the left hand
side of a square in the second row or the right hand side of a square
in the first row. If men are taken from the left hand end square of the
second row the first man is dropped into the left hand en

7. Taking of opponent's men.
If the last man of a player's move falls into a square in the second
row which is occupied and if the two squares directly in line with it
in the opponent's first and second rows are occupied the player takes
whatever number of men are in those two squares and distributes them
one at a time to each successive square, moving in an anti-clockwise
direction, but starting from the square on the anti-clockwise side of
the square on his own side of the board which he last left empty. If,
when he has done this, the last man again falls into an occupied square
which is opposite to two occupied squares of his opponent he takes
whatever men are in those squares and distributes them in the same way,
starting necessarily from the same square as previously, because that
will again be the one on the anti-clockwise side of the square last
left empty. He continues to repeat the operation so long as the
requisite conditions prevail, i.e. his last man falls into an occupied
square in line with two occupied squares of his oppo

8. Moving backwards.
Moving backwards, i.e. in a clockwise direction, is only allowed in the
following circumstances:-
   (a) It is only permissible to move backwards by starting from the
   two squares at the left hand end of the first row or the two squares
   at the left hand end of the second row.
   (b) The move must immediately result in the taking of some
   opponent's men.
The distribution of the men taken may be started from either side of
the square last left empty, but in the case of a start from the square
on the clockwise side of the empty square the move must immediately
result in the taking of some more opponent's men. Having taken all the
men possible by moving in a clockwise direction, the player continues
his move in an anti-clockwise direction by starting to distribute the
last lot of captured men from the square on the anti-clockwise side of
the empty square, relaying where possible and finishing when the last
man falls into an empty square. Moving backwards is known as
"Okutebuka" - "To go back"

9. Penalties.
A player upsetting the board loses the game. There is no penalty for
making a mistake in distributing men, but the mistake, if noticed, must
be corrected.

10. Counting men.
As a square may contain so many men that it is impossible to see at a
glance how many there are, a player may at any time count the number of
men in any square on either his own or his opponent's side of the
board.

I have tried to make the above rules clear and watertight but if any
reader notices a mistake I should be glad to hear from him. Also if any
one is acquainted with variations of the method of play in other parts
I should be very interested to know of them.

The rules sound more complicated than they are, but even so the marvel
to me is that the African has developed the game to its present pitch.

When a player is taking a long time to consider his move his opponent
may remark in an off hand tone "Nkuyege zigulya": which might be
translated "Hurry up or the white ants will eat the board". The
untutored savage!
