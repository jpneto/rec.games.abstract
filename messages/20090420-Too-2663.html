Too

An equal goals game without draws:

For two players, played with black and white stones on a hexhex
board.  The board begins empty.

1)	Starting with player 1, the players take turns.
2)	On his turn, a player must place a stone of either color onto any
empty space.
3)	The game ends when board is full.
4)	Determine the winner:
              a. If the 2nd largest black group on the board contains
more stones than the 2nd largest white group,
                  then player 1 wins.
              b. If the 2nd largest white group on the board contains
more stones than the 2nd largest black group,
                  then player 2 wins.  .
              c. If the 2nd largest groups of each color are the same
size, compare the 3rd largest groups, and so on.
                      i.  If player 1 runs out of black groups
before player 2 "runs out" of white groups, he
                          loses, and vice-versa.
                      ii. If the groups are tied all the way down the
line, then compare the largest group of each color.
                          Player with the largest largest group
wins.

Note: if two or more groups of the same color are tied for nth-
largest group of that color, then one is arbitrarily considered the
nth largest group of that color, another is considered the (n+1)th
largest, and so on.

I don't have time at the moment to make the explication any more
precise.  Hope it makes sense.
