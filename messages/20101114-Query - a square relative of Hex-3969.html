Had I ever had started contemplating 'square Hex', by which I don't
mean 'Hex on a square board' because Mark's Atoll covers that
effectively, I would have ended up empty handed. That's what can make
game inventing a very tedious affair. I found out the hard way that
you can't, to paraphrase Nietzsche, "stare into a dead end street
without having it stare back at you".

Inventing games is paying attention. I'm working on a mindsports
section called "The Evolution of Draughts Variants", and it includes a
chapter on grids. Topologically speaking, the hexgrid is equivalent
with its dual grid, that is the triangular grid. This one in turn is
equivalent with a square grid with <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> added set of diagonals.

Now take a square grid with <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> sets of diagonals, then there are
two ways to remove half of them:

1. Remove all diagonals that run in one direction - you get the
hexgrid equivalent.
2. Remove half the diagonals of both directions - you get the
'alquerque' grid.

So these two grids have a common ancestor and a similar way of
emerging from it - here's where the 'paying attention' comes in: I
started wondering if these 'twingrids' might share some
characteristics, in other words, could the most basic game on the
hexgrid have a twin on the alquerque grid?

So Query put itself together in the most logical way. The most
prominent difference was that in hex all cells are c6, while in Query
half of them were c8 and half of them c4.

And that's where I stopped paying attention. I thought, well this
works, it's finite, someone will win, thought little more of it and
posted it at BGG:

Michael Howe mentioned the imbalance immediately, and suggested a
solution that went back to our old friend Wayne Schmittberger: allow
two c4 moves or one c8 move per turn. That fitted perfectly, but still
I left the game largely where it was: on the shelf.

But today I worked on a not too illogical game position as an example,
so I had to actually play against myself (in Superpaint - I have no
boards). I soon found out that mistakes are easily made and that many
Hex-like choices present themselves, and most importantly that the
double c4 option is critical throughout.

So here's the closest thing to 'square Hex', and the explanation why
you can't get there by trying, however hard:
