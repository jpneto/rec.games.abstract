<div class="moz-text-flowed">If you want to use a hexagonal grid on a projective plane for a game, 
you will find you can't.&nbsp; There is no way to cover a projective plane 
entirely with hexagons.&nbsp; Look up "Euler characteristic" if you want to 
know why.
<br>
<br>However, you can come fairly close to a hexagonal grid, you just need to 
include a few smaller polygons.&nbsp; The most regular ways use two 
triangles, or three squares, or six pentagons, and lots of hexagons.
<br>
<br>Here is a way to build an arbitrarily large almost-hexagonal grid, with 
just five pentagons among the hexagons.&nbsp; Start with a truncated 
icosahedron:&nbsp; it has 12 pentagonal faces, 20 hexagonal, and 60 vertices. 
Replace each pentagon by a smaller pentagon, centred on the original and 
rotated through 36 degrees relative to it; replace each hexagon by a 
smaller hexagon, centred on the original and rotated through 30 degrees 
relative to it;&nbsp; and replace each vertex by a hexagon.&nbsp; Repeat the 
instructions of the previous sentence until you have enough hexagons. 
Right, now for the difficult bit:&nbsp; we need to identify all the antipodal 
pairs of faces, antipodal pairs of pentagons, and antipodal pairs of 
vertices, ending up with a grid that has half as many of each.&nbsp; A way to 
do this is to mark a set of edges that comes as close as possible to the 
"equator" of our near-spherical polyhedron, cut along it, and discard 
one half.&nbsp; Now mark each pair of opposite hex-edges of the resulting 
near-hemisphere, to indicate that the hexes they belong to in fact 
border each other.&nbsp; We have a projective plane, covered by a grid of 
many hexagons and six pentagons.&nbsp; If we intend using it for a game, it 
will be sensible to project it onto a plane and print it on paper.
<br>
<br>If instead of six equally-spaced pentagons we would rather have three 
evenly spaced squares, apply the same method, but start with a truncated 
octahedron instead of a truncated icosahedron.&nbsp; Or for two triangles, 
start with a truncated tetrahedron.
