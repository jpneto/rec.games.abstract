A fundamental theorem of combinatorial game theory states that all
impartial or non-partisan games (i.e., games where there are no moves
which are reserved to a particular player) are equivalent to nim.  So,
for game A it certainly is the case that a general strategy exists.
Finding the strategy (i.e., computing the nim-values of each of the
states) might be a chore, since there are so many legal moves from each
position and there's no simple chart-like way to tabulate all of the
positions, but it certainly exists.

Indeed, but if finding the winning strategy (or, equivalently,
deciding if a position is winning or losing) is very computationally
intensive, then the game can be considered interesting (as opposed to
Nim, where the simple strategy makes the game uninteresting).  This is
not unlike, e.g., Chess, Reversi or Go, which are deterministic but
computationally hard, so it isn't possible to formulate a simple
winning strategy.

For game A it is, currently, not known if there is a simple strategy
(except in situations with even symmetry).

For the general case we can, however, make an observation that may or
may not help finding a strategy: You can permute the rows and columns
as much as you like without changing the win/lose property of a
position.  This isn't hard to verify: You first realise that a single
swap of two columns or rows doesn't change the property, and then by
induction you show that this applies to any number of swaps.

We can, however, not just sort the rows and columns by size and then
look at the number of stones in the rows and columns.  For example:

   XX           XX
     X   and   X
   X           X

Both have the sequences 2,1,1 both vertically and horisontally, but
the first pattern is a first-player win (by removing the top row) and
the second pattern is a 2nd player win (as the 2nd player can mirror
the first player's moves over the diagonal).
