Here's a series of chess games that are very abstract: non-euclidian chess.

Take, for example, a game of chess where the right and left sides, and the up
 and sides touch each other. It would be like playing chess on a sphere.

We can also eassily imagine a chess game where the space is in fact hyperbolic.
(the game is endless, put still ends at a point).

What about also playing a game with a floating chessboard? (i.e.) everytime a 
piece gets out of the board, you move the board underneath to include the piece
AND the other pieces still at play) 

The possibilities are quite infinite, and quite abstract.

For my part, I am currently working on a 4D chess. Any other ideas?
