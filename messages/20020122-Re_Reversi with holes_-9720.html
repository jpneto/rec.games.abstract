 I am not sure how this helps?  Who exactly orientates the captured
 pieces; the player doing the capturing or the player who lost those 
 pieces?  If the player who captures the pieces can determine the
 orientation of the cross, then wouldn't he just orientate <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of his
 own color in the same direction?  (am I missing something here?  each
 player may only place his own color on the board, correct?)
