You can go, "Oh that is just politics".  If Chess were functioning

You seem to think that Chess in the past was free of cheating, controversy
and bitter denounciation.  That's an illusion created by distance.

The lawsuits aren't now part of usenet.  They operate out of here.
The past had these also, but it seemed to transcend those.  The likes
of the chess federations have less than 1% of the total number of
people who play the game, as members.  Chess was a game, in the past,
that was able to adopt and evolve.  Now all changes are locked into a
political system, where people who want certain changes are told to
leave the room, because what they have isn't chess.  Actually what
Chess is isn't what chess was when it migrated from the East into
Europe.  It actually had less mobility in the pieces.  If the
mentality of chess locked in its political climate where around today,
the Mad Queen wouldn't be anywhere, the bulk would argue it wrecked
the balance of the game, and those who liked it would of been told to
get lost.  Such a change would of labeled the person as mad as the
queen they were proposing.

Do YOU have numbers on the growth rates?  How much do you see chess
growing worldwide.  Care to explain the state of the U.S Chess
Federation today?  Do you know the numbers on members joining?  The
only guaranteed known numbers of players are how many are joining a
chess federation.  Do you know if these numbers have increased or
decreased?  I do know that U.S Chess Federation relocated from several
hours north of NYC, a major media capital to Tenn. for cost reasons.
Do you have any idea why?
