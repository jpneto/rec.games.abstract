Mancala is generally thought to have originated in Africa.  However, a letter
in the new issue of Biblical Archaeology Review (Jan/Feb 2003) claims that an
artifact found in Jericho and dating to the 7th millennium B.C.E. points to the
game's origin in ancient Israel.  Would anyone with a knowledge of Mancala's
history like to comment on this possibility?

Here's what I understand about the early history of Mancala: Egyptian
boards have been discovered which date from the Empire Age (circa
1580-1150 B.C). Several examples of Mancala-type boards were found among
the other game boards at the Kurna temple in Upper Egypt (Completed in
the reign of Seti I 1366-1333 B.C.), as well as at the temples of Karnak
and Luxor. 

It seems I've also read somewhere that there is some unproven
speculation that Mancala-type games -may- have evolved out of a simple
counting tool, perhaps used for things like counting livestock in the field.
