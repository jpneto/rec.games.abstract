I am trying to research a Viking boardgame called hnefatafl.  There is 
information about it in GURPS Vikings, but it would be nice to find out 
some more about it.  I have at least found references to the existence of 
the game.  GURPS Vikings says that the game is played on a board that is 
19X19 and has 73 pieces, with later versions becoming smaller.  The other 
two books that mention it both say that there are only 25 pieces and say 
nothing about a larger version.  Does anyone know which is right or where 
to look for the information myself?  I would also like to find out how 
the board might have been decorated.  Any information would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Kenny
