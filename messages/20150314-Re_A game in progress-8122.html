Here is an idea of game.

First : the mover counters. 

Every token has k holes. On each hole a player can place a stone. So the token can move only up to k squares. A value of k will depend heavily on the size of board.
At the setup all the token carry each one k stones.
This condition will give to the players a freedom on where to move. A player can move a token in an direction one per move. As the player move a token he has to remove as many stones as the moves. 3 moves = 3 stones less.
No jumping is allowed.
No pass is allowed.
 
Second : Refueling 

As the token moves it has less stones. So at some step (zero stone) a token can not move (run out of stones). Here comes the second idea : refueling.. A token can be refueled as it capture an opponent token by using its opponents captured stones to refuel. Friendly adjacent stone to the capturor token can be refueled too.

Third : Capturing system

A token can capture ONLY an adjacent token carrying the same number of stones or less. A token can either move from a cell to another or capture. On his turn a player perform one of the 3 actions :

- move 
- refuel 
- capture and refuel 

A token stone-free can not capture nor move. Must wait to be refueled to move or capture or refuel.

Using all those concepts the goal is to find :
- which kind of board will be optimal?
- witch kind of cell will be optimal : triagular, square, n polygon (n&gt;4)
- witch winning condition : last one to make legal move? annihilation of your opponent? scoring system at the end of the game?

Until now I have my ideas about how to build the game : on what to focus in particular.

I do not care about the originality of the game. Was it done before or not?
I still can introduce some new mechanism when it comes to the tiny details.

What I want is : few rules, no flaws, few pieces, at most 3 kind of pieces, a game duration around one hour, 

Those are my main ideas for now.
I will update each time I reach an answer.

First ideas to playtest :

- hexagonal cells (6 directions)
- tokens have to be placed at least 2 cells from each other. No random setup. No placement phase.
- with board 11*11 (12 tokens per player) I expect one hour play 
- 8 to 11 stones per token seems reasonable
- a token stone free will be a blocking piece so no token will be discarded out of the game once for all. once a token is captured the stones become property of the owner and the opponent token is placed somewhere in the board by the player who captured it. In fact the goal is to maintain the same density of tokens in the the board. The minus is that the player with more stones will progressively have a heavy advantage. So to avoid that the game fate will be decided earlier there is a need to find a mechanism to refuel the tokens if such situation occurs. Not a fake rule just for the sake of balancing the game!!! I hate that!!! A natural one. Maybe introducing "refueling stations" or something like that.

In progress.
