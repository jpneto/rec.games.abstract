We could look at this idea of 'perfection' in abstract games as a form of
mathematical elegance, or we could look at it in terms of real-world
values such as ease of play, ease of learning, simplicity of manufacture,
physical beauty of the game, etc. ...[]...

i think when it comes to this notion of defects in abstract games, we
should stick to abstract defects.  the real-world values are important,
although your "ease of play" and "ease of learning" kind of stray back
into the abstract realm.  if we think of Occam's Razor coming into the
picture, it might be that mathematical elegance and ease of play/learning
are linked.

This whole discussion is begining to remind me of Godel's Theorem.  (i.e. any
sufficiently powerful axiomatic system is inconsistent, or something like
that.)  Given that no "perfect" mathematical set of rules exists, why should
we expect that a "perfect" (i.e. non-trivial but completely consistent) set
of game rules should exist?

Come to think of it, one way to win in Nomic is to be unable to complete
one's move (in essence, to find an inconsistency in the rules).
