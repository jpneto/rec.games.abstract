lol, No one's stopping you from writing thoughtful, piercing essays, Nick.  

A little explanation since everyone's fucked up about my insights.  Whenever there's a disagreement on Game Site X, Christian leaps in to side with the proprietor. All I was saying was that we, i.e. the active, non-Toguz players can't compete with the national game Toguz.  There simply aren't enough of us.  I don't want to put words in the proprietor's mouth because, to be honest, I don't even know what his point was.  But after the non-sequitor, non-argurment, Christian butts in with the claim that there's no "we".

Here's the problem.  I want designers to be respected in the gaming community.  Programmers are glorified for programming games, while it's just assumed that these great games fall out of trees.  I'm tired of that shit.  Players, who spend months/years playing our games hundreds/thousands of times, act like designers are shit stuck on their shoes.  Again, tired of that shit.

Christian, a famous designer, having his face surgically altered to fit the programmer's ass isn't helping my cause at all.
