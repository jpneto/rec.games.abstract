Several people have inquired about games 8 and 10.  In game 8, Lafferty
got us out of our opening book on move 5.  We continued to select moves
that appeared in the literature until move 12, when Chinook varied from
published play with a weak move that eventually lost.

Are you allowed to cook your book between games or do you have to rely
on the same position not coming up again?
Also: I remember in the 92 match you informed Tinsley whenever Chinook
was in its endgame database and already knew the result of all possible
lines so that Tinsley doesn't have to waste time. Something like that.
Are you doing this again?

In game 10, Chinook responded with its own innovation (or "cook" in
checkers terminology) on move 8 which caused Lafferty to spend a lot of
time on his clock.  He made a losing move on move 15 with about 15 minutes
remaining which resulted in a lost one piece down ending.  The game was
called due to his time forfeit on move 22.

I already hear some people crying our "Foul!" :-)
