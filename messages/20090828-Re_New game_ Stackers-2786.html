Armies don't butt heads in Stackers, as two armies can't block each

Torben, stop evading me.  This is the third time around on this
topic.  In Stackers you've got two opposing armies on opposite sides
of the board with pieces that can only move one square, not like Chess
where a bishop might fly three quarters of the way across the board in
one move, cutting through enemy troops in the process, and easily
facilitating the intermixing of armies.  Can we assume that the two
Stackers armies <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> slowly approach each other and make contact,
creating what may <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>appear<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be a temporary, impasse-like situation?

Only to someone who is desperately trying to see it as such.

I'm going to take a leap of faith and assume you're still with me
here.  Neither army is "blocked" in the sense of having no legal
forward moves.  I know that.  BUT, if neither player wants to be the
first to form a mixed stack, AND neither player wants to open a
corridor allowing the enemy to pass through, you've got yourself a
full blown impasse - a lovely example of an unforced draw.

I can't see why you would not want to be the first to form a mixed
stack.  It is not important who is at the bottom of the stack, but who
is on top.

Your claim is like saying that you in Go would not want to be the first
player to place a stone next to an opponent.  Both actions (moving on
top of another piece in Stacker and blocking a freedom in Go) can start
a race to "win" a stack or group.  Whether you win or lose that race
does not depend on who started it.

Is the preceding example like two retarded idiots, drooling and
sliding Chess rooks from side to side in place?  No!  In my case, I'm
not a drooling, retarded idiot.  I've played Chess many times and I've
always made some effort to get my pieces out into play.  Nobody had to
teach me that.  It just somehow seemed like the right thing to do.

You could say that the game taught you that: It was pretty obvious after
a few plays that a passive style wouldn't work.

This is a serious limitation in your game play.  Why limit your strategy
ahead of time instead of doing what is right in any given situation?

 If my opponent,
presumably also not a drooling, retarded idiot felt the same way, we'd

In this very hypothetical situation, yes.  But I can't see this as any
less hypothetical than having two Chess players passively waiting for
the other to move.
