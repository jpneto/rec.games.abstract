By the way, on KGS (the biggest English speaking real time Go
server), Dusk Eagle and myself are 2d, illluck is 3d, and Bill is 5d
and someone that has done a lot of theoretical study on the game,
so you've managed to land yourself some reasonable players
analysing this thing :D

I'm totally psyched, believe me.  I check LifeIn19x19 every ten minutes,
starting at 5:00 am, to see if anyone has made a move or a comment.  It's a
tremendous effort for me not to comment at L19.  I don't want to hamper the
initiative with my inanity.  Here at rga they're used to it.

Hehe, that does make me chuckle :) It's great seeing your excitement too ;)

I've been half tempted to consider a turn based Redstone server. Not any time soon as I'm snowed under, but if I keep enjoying it this much I'll keep you posted.
