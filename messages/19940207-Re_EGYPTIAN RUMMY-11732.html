when one player has finally acquired all the cards, he must run through the

	Ooch.  I don't think that would work where I play, since games
routinely last multiple hours.  (There are usualy enough players trying to
'slap in' that short games are rare.)

i think it was because the best player in my high school was sooooo good that
he only lost once (to me :) and he implemented it just to taunt us  :0

	So what do you do when a player <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>knows<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> that there's a jack 4 cards

i have always played that you can slap in intentionally all you want.  all the
other players can do is hope that person miscalculates...

i was playing the other night against two other people and i lost all my cards,
then slapped in on doubles, then promptly lost all my cards again, then was 
again able to slap in on doubles, and lost all my cards again and slapped in...
well, i finally slapped in on a jack and double queens and ending up winning
the game off of that :)


what a great game...
