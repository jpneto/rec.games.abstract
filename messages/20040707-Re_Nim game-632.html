A fundamental theorem of combinatorial game theory states that all
impartial or non-partisan games (i.e., games where there are no moves
which are reserved to a particular player) are equivalent to nim.  So,
for game A it certainly is the case that a general strategy exists.
Finding the strategy (i.e., computing the nim-values of each of the
states) might be a chore, since there are so many legal moves from each
position and there's no simple chart-like way to tabulate all of the
positions, but it certainly exists.

Indeed, but if finding the winning strategy (or, equivalently,
deciding if a position is winning or losing) is very computationally
intensive, then the game can be considered interesting (as opposed to
Nim, where the simple strategy makes the game uninteresting).  This is
not unlike, e.g., Chess, Reversi or Go, which are deterministic but
computationally hard, so it isn't possible to formulate a simple
winning strategy.

I didn't mean to imply that the game is not interesting ("chore" was a
bad word choice), I was only answering the factual question of whether a
strategy exists.  This is different from whether a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>simple<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> strategy
exists, partly because "simple" is not a well-defined term.  This is
different yet again from the partisan games you name, because for both
chess and go we do not even know whether a strategy exists even though
the rules are deterministic.

In fact, "strategy" is not a very useful word here, because what the
theorem means is that there is only one strategy for all non-partisan
games: make an appropriate nim-move for the nim-value of the current
position.  The thing that makes non-partisan games more or less simple
is the complication of determining/finding/computing the nim-value of
the position in the first place.  Obviously Nim is very easy, and it
seems like this game is interestingly difficult.

Note that the first position is equivalent to

   XX
   X
     X

which is symmetrical, and yet is not a P-position because of the stones
on the diagonal.
