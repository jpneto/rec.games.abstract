The only idea I've had has been to give participants a number of wooden
sticks and those little balls with the holes in that join the sticks to
make molecule models, plus some saran wrap and a number of ping-pong balls.
They each have to make a shape that will hold as many ping-pong balls as
possible when the saran wrap is used to enclose the shape (making a
convex solid).  Then they get to pool all their sticks and balls; they
should easily be able to make a shape that contains more ping-pong balls
than the number of participants times the largest score that any individual
came up with.  Any other ideas?

Buckey would be proud of you.  You might want to try skimming through some
of his books.  He discusses the advantages of global electric power grids,
floating cities, and prefab housing.  You might be able to pick up some
ideas there.

I'm not sure that the Prisoners' Dilemma illustrates the the idea of synergy
very well.  It has the potential to only end up proving that the world is a
mean nasty and cruel place where you have to make tough choices and live
with the consequences.  And, you should never trust anyone.

Of course your volume is going to increase as a factor of n^3 sticks while
only requiring n^2 sticks.  So, whether or not they actually work together,
they should end up more successful as a team.

It's possible that you could start them out alone and then gradually make
the groups bigger and bigger until finally everyone is joining their
individual pieces into one large shape.  Not being rocket scientists, they
may not see the advantages of icosahedral symmetries.  But, cubes and tent
shapes should prove the point as well.  Hmm..  this is starting to sound
like fun.  I wonder if I could get the Society of Physics students to do this.

You do realize that you'll need LOTS of ping pong balls?
