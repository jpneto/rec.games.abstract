As long as there's sufficient space on the board (not sure what
sufficient is exactly), you can often find spots for neutrals that
seem to help you more than your opponent, in the sense that they
contribute to a potential frame for you which is smaller than any of
the potential frames of your opponents' to which it contributes. At
some point, as the board starts to get crowded, that must end.  But I
have no idea when though. Trying to figure it out is melting my
brain.

No it isn't. The decision to decline, if not in the general stage of
growth, must lie in the plan and the tactics involved. I'm sure it
gives increasing tension as the board fills up, and one can refuse to
decline, or the other, but not both.
I'm just curious about the moment, and the first games will likely be
off target in terms of timing, but the thing appears self-directing
with increased experience.
