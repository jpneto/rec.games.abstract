Due to recent events with an organizer of a Hudson Valley boardgamer
group with around 100 members dropping it, I have taken over the
organizer role of the group, and have relaunched it under the name
Midhudson Area Gaming Enthusiasts (M.A.G.E) and letting Geek know.

I am looking to have this group mixed with the MAWS group that has
been going on for over 10 years now, to have a big network of gamers
in the area.  Combined with original meetup group (renamed MAGE) and
MAWS is a member base of over 100 people, ranging from New York to
Pennsylvania, to New Jersey to Connecticut, with meetings expected to
be centered around Poughkeepsie.  The combined group has a HUGE range
of interest in games and activities, from wargaming and Ameritrash to
Euros and traditional and party games.  Included also is interest in
social games and "sports" games (minigolf and bowling and pool) to
even videogames.

I welcome anyone interested in being involved with a group that meets
in Mid-Hudson area (within a 1 hour radius of Poughkeepsie) to go to
the meetup group, check it out and sign up for notifications.  You can
do that by visiting here:

My hope for the group is that it will act as a centralized hub for
having gamers in the area network with each other to have a good time.

Thank you for your time.  Please visit the Meetup group and sign up if
you are looking for gamers.
