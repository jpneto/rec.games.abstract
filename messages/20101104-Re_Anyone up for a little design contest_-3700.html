This is something that has interested me as well, and I'm not saying it's
impossible, but the obvious problem is that I have my local 4-in-a-row, you
have your local 4-in-a-row, so who wins?  Symmetry tends to kill the
"Hex-like properties of one unique winner" in local win condition games
because I win in my locale and you win in your locale.  As I said though,
I'm not strictly ruling out any possibilities.

I can think of trivial (to say nothing of stupid) local patterns where
completing the pattern in one color prevents the pattern in the
opposite color, but I can't think of patterns which both have that
property AND where the pattern must exist in one color when the board
is full.  For example: 9-in-a-row on a hexhex5 board.
