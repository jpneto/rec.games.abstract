I recall discussion of Settlers, where, instead of dice, it was
suggested that there be a deck of 36 cards representing every
permutation of dice rolls to come up.  This approach is to insure an
even distribution of dice rolll results to balance things out.

Ok, my question is this:  Let's say, we have a deck of 36 cards.  The
deck consists of 6 cards of each possible die roll on a 6 sided die
(1-6), for 36 cards (6 1's, 6 2's, etc...).  The cards are shuffled
and TWO cards are flipped over and a die roll result is generated. 
What would the odds distribution be for doing this?  Would it be the
same as standard dice rolls or different?  I am curious, because I was
interested in kicking this around as a new way to generate two six
sided dice rolls.

This is not quite the same as a 2D6 dice roll, Richard.  Let's say the
first card drawn is a 1.  The second card has a slightly lower chance
of being a 1 (since there are now five 1s and six of every other
number in the deck).  This imbalance in distribution will continue
(possibly in more dramatic ways) until the deck is reshuffled.

Now, if you're trying to emulate the roll of two ordinary dice, your
method is better than the deck of 36 cards with every combination on
them.  For example, if the first card drawn from the latter type of
deck is 1-1, you can't possibly get another result of "2" until the
deck is reshuffled.  If the first two draws from the former type of
deck ar both 1, the odds of getting a result of "2" is much smaller
than 1/36, but it isn't zero.

However, as you note, the purpose of the card deck isn't to emulate
normal dice rolls, but to ensure an even distribution.  In this
regard, your deck doesn't do as good a job.  It's entirely possible to
go through an entire deck and never get a result of a "7".  So while
your deck might be an interesting middle ground between the two
extremes, I'm not sure it really accomplishes what players are looking
for in a card deck.
