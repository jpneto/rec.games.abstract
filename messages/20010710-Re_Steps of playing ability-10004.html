Furthermore, I doubt that there's any meaningful concept of the
difficulty of a game per se, not regarding the human players.
Mathematically, there are for full-information, two-player non-random
games just two kinds of plays: The correct ones (that conform to the
winning strategy) and the incorrect ones.

In practice, this is not true.  If you're in a chess position which is
drawn with best play by both players then a losing move is clearly
worse than one which maintains the draw,
 but it's absurd to claim that all moves which maintain the draw are
equally good;  some will give you better winning chances than others.

If your opponent is less than perfect, yes.

I'll go further. If you're in a position which is won by you with best
play, then a losing or drawing move is clearly worse than one which wins.

But if, say, move A will give you a draw against both best play and your
current opponent, and move B will give you a loss against best play but
give you a chance of a loss, draw, or win against your current opponent,
then is move B better or worse than move A?
