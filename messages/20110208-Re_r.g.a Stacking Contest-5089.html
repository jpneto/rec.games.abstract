Yes, you certainly can.  Very easily.

Oh very convincing Christian.  You could absurdly save the day by exposing
Bill Taylor and ruining his popularity.  Bill Taylor has abundantly
demonstrated that he couldn't care less about his popularity in
rec.games.abstract or anywhere else.  He's a complete fucking buffoon.

It's not about "tea party" or "we the people".  It's about quality of
voters.  I barely trust my fellow designers to render an unbiased vote.  To
me, "We, the inventors, need those voters" translates to "Jeez I better
rally as many of my friends as I can if I'm to have any hope of beating the
other social butterflies who are undoubtedly doing the same thing."  Now we
have a popularity contest whose outcome has nothing to do with the quality
of the games.

If this is to be a yearly event, voting should be possible for
all interested in abstract games, or else it would miss its target.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't really care if the contest "misses its target".  To me the contest
was something for the designers to enjoy among themselves, as well as
providing spectator interest, which it clearly has.  I don't see any call to
open the floodgates here.

In any case, I'm done being worked up about this.  Quite simply, if the
voting is open to more than the contest entrants, I withdraw Monkey Queen. 
You guys work it out among yourselves what you want to do.  I sense there
won't be any tears shed for the withdrawal of Monkey Queen, so maybe it's
for the best.
