If N and M is odd then it is a win for the first player else it is a

Only in case you start with a full board I presume?

However, the idea was to start with random configurations (0 or 1
piece on each field). [One might think about starting with an empty
board and both players 'building up' a configuration until one of the
players - when it is her turn - decides it is advantageous to start
removing pieces according to above rules.]

Where can I find a derivation of the 'a full board of odd sizes gives
a N-position' rule?

Actually, on a full NxN board, it is a win for the second player
unless N=1 (in which case, it is obviously a first-player win).

If the board is initially full, it doesn't matter which row or column
you take, as they are all alike.  This is true even after a number of
rows or column are taken.  Hence, all that matters is whether you take
a row or a column.  So we may as well assume you always take the
leftmost column or topmost row.  If you start with a square, the
second player can (by taking row when the first player takes column
and vice-versa) always force it into a square with one less colunm and
row, i.e., from NxN to (N-1)x(N-1) etc.  So, if N&gt;1, the first player
is eventually faced with a 2x2 board.  If he removes a row or column,
the second player removes the other and thereby wins.

no no no, Joe never said a player has to take a complete row or column, only
that all the removed stones must either reside in the same row or in the
same column!

E.g. in this position:
 +-------+
 | # # # |
 | # # # |
 | # # # |
 | # # # |
 +-------+

a player could move to leave either of the following:

 +-------+
 | #   # |
 | # # # |
 | #   # |
 | # # # |
 +-------+

or

 +-------+
 | # # # |
 | # # # |
 |     # |
 | # # # |
 +-------+
etc.
