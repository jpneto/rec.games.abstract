    If we carry the concept of equalization one step further, 
we can create many new games out of  existing games. The 
equalization adaptation to a game is to include picking a color
or side before a series of 2 moves. For instance, in a chess 
games, player 1 picks a color, then player 2 makes a move follow
by player 1's move. On the second turn, player 2 picks a color
and then player 1 moves follow by player 2's move.
    With this rule, games can go in one of 2 directions. A lopsided 
game, where One color is weaken quickly and the winner is determined 
by who gets the strong color last. Or an even game, where both colors 
struggle for every inch every move. With the changing of color, a better 
player can not dominate the game as quickly. The lopsided games seem to make
shorter game, the even games could last forever. 
    Chess players are probably too rigid (read dull) for any kind of innovation. 
Can you think of a game that may work well with an adaption of
equalization?
    Equ-checker? Equ-othello? or Equ-4-D-tic-tac-toe?
