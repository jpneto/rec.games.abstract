A magnanimous giving of yourself then.  How does that explain the month of
non-stop vitriol that landed you in a monkey cage?

If you really want to know what happened here before, just look at what's
happening now.  When I saw Christian's account of how his game announcements
are almost always ignored - exept when they're getting complained about - I
thought I was reading my own story.  Eventually you're like, "Hey people. 
Fuck off.  I'm the only one contributing decent games and it's like I have a
disease."

Then the dogpiling begins.  Only instead of Bill and Corey, keepers of the
turd, dogpiling on Christian, it was Bill and five other morons dogpiling on
me.  Same Billy the bully.  Different ant.
