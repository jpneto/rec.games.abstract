This sounds like a game I played in a school class once. There were
four times of ~8 people each. Each team had an envelope and a card
that was blue on one side, red on the other. The game was played for,
say, ten rounds - always a predefined number of rounds. Play included
a discussion period, followed by the four teams putting their card
secretly in their envelope either red or blue side forward. Scoring
went something like this, but not exactly, based on the number of
teams that had blue facing, as opposed to red:

 #with	| #with	| points given	| points given
blue up	| red up| to blue teams	| to red teams
----------------------------------------------
    4	|   0	|     +10	|    --
    3   |   1	|     -10	|   +30
    2	|   2	|     -20	|   +20
    1	|   3	|     -30	|   +10
    0	|   4	|      --	|   -10

Any team that has at least 100 points after the ten rounds is a
winning team. Scores start at 0 and can go (very) negative. The ideal
game is where all 4 teams play blue each time, and all four teams win.
[When I played it, all members of all winning teams got A's in the
class.] After about six rounds the teacher redesigned the scoring to
heighten the stakes and make it so all teams could still win if we all
worked together and showed blue. We did for three rounds, and on the
last round, one team was treacherous and played red, getting a few
hundred points and making the rest of us lose.

Now for your game, Trust: No, it won't be hard at all to do your
parser and AI. Don't worry about it.

As for the voting, I would do the following prompts in order:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Do you vote to accept all proposals other than your own (y/n/a)?
 Do you vote to accept all proposals from Player 1 (y/n/a)?
 Do you vote to accept proposal 1 from player 1 (y/n/a)?
 Do you vote to accept proposal 2 from player 1 (y/n/a)?
 Do you vote to accept proposal 3 from player 1 (y/n/a)?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That way people won't have to respond to superfluous amounts of
questions if they're going to answer them all the same.

P.s. Could someone mail me a description of Prisoner's Dilemma, or
mail me the FAQ?
