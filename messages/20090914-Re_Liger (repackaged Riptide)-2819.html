Nick, you were right.  The rich-get-richer phenomenon started to
manifest itself after several days of play testing.  I switched back
to the Min-showing version and the transformation from unstable to
stable was remarkable.  Good call.  If only there were more like you
here and less of the lemma quoting bore mongers.  I have to ask
though, are we ever going to see an equal goals game from you?

Thanks Mark!  A compliment from you is a rare gem indeed.  I'm
surprised that Riptide/Liger worked out the way it did, since after
you explained your original choice for the rule in the last post, it
made sense to me.  I guess the novelty of the mechanic makes it hard
for me to analyze.  In any case, I'm happy to have made a constructive
suggestion.

As for equal goals games, I've got several, but I'm not jazzed by any
of them.  I am not as focused on equal goals games as many people here
because the equality that matters most to me is the equality in the
players' chances of winning (assuming equal skill).  Equal goals games
can be just as prone to inequality of winning chances as unequal goals
games (e.g. Hex without the pie rule), so equal goals has no special
import to me.  I don't have anything against equal goals games, it's
just that ones I've invented aren't very good, from a gameplay point
of view.  But as soon as i have a good one, you can be sure I'll post
it here.
