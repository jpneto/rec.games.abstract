Hi,

I was banished as usual from BGG. 
So I could not answer to you.
You wrote :

"I tend to agree with that statement but not with your conclusion. There's nothing wrong with books on or courses in inventing abstract strategy games (even if they are given by failed inventors turned teachers). Without fakes, how would one recognise the real thing?"

When I said fake culture I meant the kind of behaviour of some people like Russ who are not game designers and who think wrongfully that books, interviews, what game designers in general are writing or saying all this "culture" is helpful for the wannabe game designers. Many things of what we call experts say are lies or at best idealizations (intellectual make-up) to make their work look like something unreachable and so on.
Designing games like any artistitic scientific or intellectual activity is :
-90% hard work (try and retry test and retest and so on)
- 5% luck (finding the good idea or the right path)
- 5% passion (you have to love your activity art science game litterature and so on).
Spreading the idea that reading others or even knowing what others accomplished is not NECESSARY. It could help little bit but not necessary.
Once you understand what is the core of the game activity you could design great games. Look at the kids or even at the animals (there are many studies about animal games) and see how they invent games. Look at all the cultures and see how people invent games.
No need for books nor fake culture (fake = superficial). The deepness no one will show what it is. You have to be involved body and soul to create something great. Anyone could create great games (hardwork luck and passion).
Behind any great game you will find an individual passionnate lucky who worked lot.

This may all be true though I have difficulty assigning such precise percentages. My point is that people's opinions on the subject don't matter all that much to me. It never changed my attitude towards inventing. I preferred the process over talking about it because the latter is more problematic, but since I stopped (I <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> actually invent a game since then, but wholly accidentally), talking about it is a nice way to slowly reduce my involvement. I'm passionate about games, not so much about endless discussions. I'm too old to get fanatical about what's true and what is not, never mind the grey area in between.

Hi,

Now I think that we agree completly on one thing : invent invent invent do not talk about how you invent.
That is why I hate Russ and some other guys in BGG : always talking about what is a combinatorial game what is an abstract game and so on.
INVENTEZ! BORDEL DE MERDE! AU LIEU DE DEBATTRE DE CE QUE SONT LES JEUX OU LE PROCESSUS CREATIF.
Almost no one talk about technicalities : how to balance a game? how to make a mechanism be more efficient? how to .....
Anyway I remain convinced that the age is not an obstacle to invention. On the contrary it is now or ever that you can invent something revolutionnary..
Good luck to you.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
