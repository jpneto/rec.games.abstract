Need to play it a bit to know, but no matter how good the game is, as
a commercial project it is doomed. OK, maybe a little strong, we could
say you have an immense uphill path ahead of you. Have you ever heard
of Plateau?

Its history is something every would-be abstract self-publisher should
read. The Plateau designer had everything going for him, including
very good exposure of the game and a recommendation from Sid Sackson,
and expended a lot of money, and still it is only an obscure curiosity
today. So don't bet your life savings on it...

Yes, I am aware of the challenges ahead, although I believe that you
may be a little too pessimistic...

I don't expect to make a living off of this, breaking even will
satisfy me fine.

Also, I would say that my game is rather unique. I have never seen any
board with looks quite like it.

Neither have I, but there are a lot of abstract games, so I'm not 100%
sure :-)

I don't mean to discourage you. Some designers have succeeded with
abstracts in recent years. Especially John Yianni and Hive is
something you should look into for an idea of how to make a game
float... but I don't quite understand how he did it himself. One thing
is certain: It is mostly eurogamers who will consider buying an
unknown abstract, so unless you want to change the world (like Richard
Hutnik ;-) that's your audience outside your circle of friends.
