2) In the combinatorial games literature which I own or to which I
   have easy access, I recall no discussion of these games (henefatafl
   specifically, not general "tafl" games such as 9 Men's Morris, Fox
   and Geese, etc).  Does anyone know of any?

I wish I did. Part of the problem is that there is no agreement on what
the rules were. There is more of a consensus on hnefatafl than on, say,
ludus latrunculorum. There is actually quite a bit of similarity among
many proposed reconstructions of the rules, especially more recent ones,
and many of the rules sets do make the game enjoyable. But even rather
minor differences in the rules can make a big difference in stategy and
tactics. Since there is not a large enough group of people playing the
game according to the same rules, we do not have a body of experts
gradually building up practical knowledge of the game which could be
passed on to other talented people, and to a lesser extent to ordinary
mortals. A pity, because it looks like hnefatafl could be quite a good
game if we had some good strategic principles.

The (almost certain) reasons for the confusion over rules are:

1. We know of no set of written down rules - the nearest we have from the
17th century give part of the rules written by someone who may have
observed, but did not play the game [&amp; more likely his informant had half
remembered rules he'd seen his grandfather play by ...]

 From my reading, the rules for the Tafl family of games have come to us
from a couple different sources. The game Tablut was recorded in the diary
of the Swedish botanist Linnaeus in 1732. He found the game being played by
Alpine Lapplanders and recorded the set up and a description of the rules.
An even earlier description of Hnefatafl-type game survives in an English
manuscript from the reign of King Athelstan (A.D. 925-40). It includes a
diagram of a board and the starting positions on a 19 x 19 grid and at
least partial rules for the game. There's a photo of the MS page in R.C.
Bell's "Board &amp; Table Games from Many Civilizations." But I've always
assumed these may have been �folk games� with rules that may have varied
from one village to the next. I like to say that games are like languages
-they have dialects that change as they move from place to place.
