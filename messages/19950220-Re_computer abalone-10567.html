Although I do not know of an Mac Abalone games, I know of a very very good
program for the PC.  It was written by a friend of mine who named it
El Boana.  In his research of the game he discovered a simple way for 
either player to force a draw, hence possibly rendering the game degenerate.

I have references to many abalone sources, including a Mac game, 
from my home page:  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/danlip.html">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/danlip.html</a>
A copy of the info is below.

It is possible to force a draw in abalone ['draw' meaning no one has won the
game after some large fixed number of moves].  However, I would hardly call
any program that does this "very very good".  I think that a draw in
abalone should count the same as a loss - thus any program that forces
a draw ends up with a loosing score everytime.  There have been quite
a few abalone players written, and one of the problems the authors try
to avoid is this extreme conservatism (i.e. sitting in an immovable position
forever).

I would like to get a copy of this player if it is available.  So far I
have yet to find a challenging computer opponent, so if it is very good,
I want to play against it.  If it is available from a public site, I will
reference the site in my home page.

Here are the refernces I have so far

ABALONE ON THE NET (last updated Feb 13, 1995)

What I have found so far:

There is an abalone play-by-mail server.  Send mail to
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@netcom.com">pbmserv@netcom.com</a>  with  "help summary abalone" (no quotes)
as the subject line.

The records of a computer competition, and more info about
the above PBM server, may be found at:

There is a Mac abalone player by Peter Tax, on info-mac.
It has a real slick interface.

There is an ftp site containing C++ code for an abalone AI,
written by a group of MIT grad students.  The code is
written for an older version of g++, and the Makefile is
messy, so good luck getting a compile (I havent done it yet).

There is also an archive from a mailing list about abalone,
also at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.medg.lcs.mit.edu/ftp/abalone">http://www.medg.lcs.mit.edu/ftp/abalone</a>.
