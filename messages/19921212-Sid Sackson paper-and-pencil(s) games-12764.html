Back in the dim recesses of my memory, I remember two books of games for
colored pencils and dice.  I believe they were written, or edited, by
Sid Sackson.  One was called "Beyond Solitaire" and had one-person games,
including one called Pinball, and one called Profit and Loss.  The other
was "Beyond Tic-Tac-Toe" and had a number of games with the names of 
modern artists, including one called Mondrian, and another called Klee.
These games were for two or more players.

As I recall, some of the BTTT games were based on graph coloring; others
I don't remember at all.  I was very young at the time, and would play them
with my father.  This was probably late 1970's, or early 1980's (dating
myself, I suppose...)

Does anyone remember these books; if so, are they still available?  <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Books<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
in_Print doesn't list them.  Barring that, if other people's memories are
better than mine, would it be possible to try to reconstruct some of the
playing boards (they were on detachable perforated sheets), and rules,
for possible adjustment into computer game form?

Replies via email, or followups if you think there's general interest in
these...
