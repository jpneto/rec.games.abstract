I agree.  My first reaction to "make one up myself" was, "Wow, another
brilliant writer from PSU, and it doesn't even give its real name on
the 'from' line."  (Yes, slam intended :-)

Building original objects out of LEGO is a kind of mechanical design
process.  Creating a good game is an entirely different thing.  The
fact that the pieces are made of LEGO doesn't change this.

It disturbs me that everyone here slams people who like to build sets
following some sort of instructions 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I guess I am part of "everyone" in this case, since I expressed utter
amazement that people bothered to follow instructions that came with
any kit.  But that's not because I consider this to indicated
inferiority of mind--it's just that as a child, it never even crossed
my mind that I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> build models according to some instructions.
In fact, I don't even know if the sets I got came with instructions or
not.  I vaguely recall some color photographs of models; do those
count?

(except Technics sets of course, THOSE
are OK for some reason).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I saw the recent pieces with the rods and little gears and whatnot
only last year, in the context of an AI project in mechanical design
at Cornell.  Again, I never saw the "instructions" for these parts
so I don't even know if there are any.  (Perhaps these are Dacta
rather than Technics?  Does it make a difference?)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Some people might like to put models together and for them
using Legos is just another form of model building.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I used to assemble those little plastic airplane and boat models too.
In that case you had to follow the instructions exactly, or the pieces
wouldn't go together.  I also followed the painting instructions as
well as I could and used the "right" set of decals.  But the resulting
models were infinitely more lifelike than anything I ever saw in LEGO
at that time.

Now I see that there are a whole bunch of LEGO models that are almost
lifelike but not quite--like a space shuttle with curved surfaces in
most of the right places but these funny knobs protruding where they
shouldn't.  Probably these are a lot of fun for kids to play with, but
it's so far outside my experience that I don't really understand
it--similarly, I suppose, to the way my parents couldn't understand
how my LEGO building continued on into high school and even college
years.

(Once again, this is an example of what I call the LEGO "generation
gap": I'm 31 years old and got my last set apparently before most of
the people on this group got their first.)

 Legos are for whatever you
want to use them for.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Precisely--which was why every new set got dumped into the two big
bins with my old bricks to supplement whatever I was creating at the
time, regardless of whatever the LEGO company thought I was "supposed"
to be doing with them.
