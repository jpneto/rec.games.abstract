Thanks, I knew about this site, but I see there are some nice additions
since last time I looked at it. Still, many good games are missing from
the listing, in favor of games that don't appear to play very well.

In fact, the website goal is to present the largest possible set of games and
ideas about games falling the website rule criteria (games with one or two types
of pieces per player).

As you might expect, the list will never be complete... :-)

If you have archives with game rules not covered by the site, I ask you to send
them to me.

Thanks!

Joao Neto
