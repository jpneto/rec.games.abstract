What is this idiocy you keep repeating about me "convincing" game
sites to carry my games??  I wish I had the type of influence you seem
to think I do!  Almost all of them either contacted <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>me<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> about adding
my games, or they just added them and I found out about it after the
fact.  Do you really think these proprietors are dribbling idiots that
can be "convinced" to carry games they don't really like??  What a
stupid fuck you are!!  9 of the 15 sites that added one of my games
came back and added more of them later.  Boy, I must be an amazing
convincer!!

Again with the convincing!  What an idiot!!

Ok, if you insist!!  Here's a link to igGameCenter's most played games
for the past 30 days:

As you can clearly see, Oust is number 5 on the list, and Kauri is
number 79!  And Oust has only been there for 22 days!!  Good point,
idiot!!  Considering Oust is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> long game, taking around two
hours even on a small 11x11 board, I'd say it beats the crap out of
the quickie 15 minute Kauri!

If getting reamed up the ass is your idea of "winding the crank", wind
away!!  What an unbelievable fool you are!!  I thought Bullshitting
Bill had R.G.A. Buffoon of the Month all wrapped up.  But apparently
you're running off with the title!!  What a complete idiot!!!!
