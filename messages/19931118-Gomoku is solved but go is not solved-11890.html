: Apropos: What about Renju ?  (the japanese professional variante)

Unlike unrestricted gomoku, Renju is probably as hard to solve as chess,
because

(1) In Renju, positions that emerge after the opening are often of a 
    "chaotic" nature, as the Japanese say.  It means that no one of the two
    sides has a clear attack; many plans and many moves are possible, so
    that the combinatorial explosion is really an explosion.  (Well, in Go
    the phenomenon is more pronounced :-)).

    This is very much in contrary to unrestricted gomoku, where, if
    Black plays correctly, there are always few obviously strong moves
    for Black and to each of these moves, a still fewer number of White's
    responses (many times just one) that don't lose very soon.

(2) Renju is a moving target.  Renju has a complicated "opening rule"
    that serves to ensure more or less equal chances for Black and White
    <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a large variety of openings.  From time to time (appr. every
    15-20 years) this opening rule is changed.  (The middle-game rules
    (forbidden 3x3, 4x4 and 6 for Black) haven't changed since 1936).

    It is interesting that the main idea of the current opening rule, 
    adopted in 1988-89, is the balancing scheme discussed not long ago in
    rec.games.abstract: after the third move of the game (made by Black)
    White can "change colors", i.e. decide that from now on, *(s)he* will
    play as Black.  (This is only the main idea, there are many additional
    bangs and whistles).

    By the way, gomoku with appropriate opening rules is perfectly playable,
    in fact, there were a couple of world chamionships.

I haven't heard before that Victor Allis (, too,) solved gomoku, but with 
all respect for him, the Black's win in unrestricted gomoku is known since 
the 19th century, so that the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fact<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is not new, it can be only a new kind 
of proof.

Disclaimer: I quit playing Renju seriously several years ago, so maybe 
something drastic has happened in the Renju community that I am not aware of.

IF ANYONE COULD SEND ME ANY INFORMATION ABOUT VICTOR ALISS' PROOF, I WILL BE
VERY GRATEFUL.

Leonid
