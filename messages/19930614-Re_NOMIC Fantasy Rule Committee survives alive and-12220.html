|&gt; These are the Round 8 Fantasy Rule Valid Ordinances: 
|&gt; 
|&gt; 
|&gt; Ordinance 8001 (Chatham):
|&gt; 
|&gt; Rule of Hypocrisy:
|&gt; Any subsequently posted fantasy rule must violate any and all 
|&gt; restrictions it would impose on future fantasy rules.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Ordinance 8002 (Chatham):
|&gt; 
|&gt; Each subsequent fantasy rule A must include an example of a fantasy rule
|&gt; B that would be valid if A were valid and this rule (this very rule, the
|&gt; one you are now reading) had not been posted.
|&gt;                         
|&gt; Ordinance 8003 (Davidb):
|&gt; 
|&gt; Any future Fantasy Rules Committee Ordinances must be written using words
|&gt; of only one syllable.  The 8002 mandated example is:
|&gt;          All new rules must have the word "smile" in them.
|&gt; 

Comment: is 8003 a valid rule? I'd think not!
(Note: I'm no nomic player, just a rec.puzzler reading r.g.a on occasion)

To be valid 8003 must contain an example of a rule that would be valid
if 8003 is valid and 8002 is not. This example is
 ' All new rules must have the word "smile" in them'
which obviously is written using words of only one syllable, (and does
not include another example, which it is not required to do).

However to be a valid rule must not this example also comply with
ord. 8001?
 'Any subsequently posted fantasy rule must violate any and all 
  restrictions it would impose on future fantasy rules.'

The example does not violate the imposed restriction of having to
contain the word "smile", hence it would not be valid, hence
8003 has <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> included an example that would be valid, and
hence 8003 can not be valid.

A valid 8003 would be f.i,
 Ordinance 8003 :
 
 Any future Fantasy Rules Committee Ordinances must be written using words
 of only one syllable.  The 8002 mandated example is:
          All new rules must have the word "smile" in them, and this word
		  may not be placed in quotes.
