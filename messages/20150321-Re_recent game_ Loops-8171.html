The game could technically have a position with no loops. I'm almost positive that it couldn't form in actual gameplay, but if both players tried to form a loopless game, then they could.

How I understood the rules, a loopless game couldn't happen in Loops, even between cooperating players.  I interpreted a loop to be a group of like-colored, interconnected stones which include at least two perimeter stones.  For example, two like-colored, adjacent perimeter stones would by themselves form a loop.  Even if you required that a loop's two perimeter stones be widely separated, the principles of Hex (or Y if you prefer) would guarantee that one player would have that.  And yes, you can form filled-in loops.  Why not?  The end of the game comes when the board is completely filled, or equivalently, when no new loops can be formed.  There's no need for passing.  

Assuming Red always moves first:

Scenario A: The left side of the board is solid blue, and the right side solid red.  Red wins by one point.

Scenario B: The left side of the board is solid blue, except for one red stone embedded in the blue mass, and the right side solid red.  Blue wins by one point.

Like I said earlier, every point will be owned by one player or the other, precluding draws.

In such a situation neither player would want to place pieces and they would both pass (which is how the game originally ended), but of course they might pass with an even number of spaces occupied.

I mean, it's your game, but I don't see any reason to make it Go-like by allowing passing.  In fact, after some consideration, I do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> consider Loops to be a Go variant, in spite of the obvious, but superficial, similarities.  Loops isn't captureless Go with loop rules tacked on.  The loop rules are the essence of Loop, and there's no need to involve Go principles.

Like I said players actually trying to win couldn't form the position, but the game not being technically drawless still obviously wasn't ideal. :P

What position?

Louis made the suggestion that just making it impartial would solve the issue, and i had tested it like that previously, so i knew it would still be fun. It's very possible that it would actually be the "simplest" solution. Louis also pointed out that it might even make the game "better" by making life slightly harder.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good man, Luis.  He made a valuable suggestion for improving Redstone.  I don't know what impartial means, though I'm guessing that means filling in your own loops, or forming filled in loops that are filled in from the moment of their formation.  In any case, it sounds like a Go concept, which, at the risk of repeating myself, isn't necessary.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Just forcing players to play to a full board w/o impartial moves could of course have players filling in their own loops. And of course that too could be solved by allowing loops to surround their own color. I was really close to just going with this, and who knows maybe I should have.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't see why you wouldn't want players filling in their own loops, though I'm far from being an expert in the playing of any game, especially Go.  But it seems like it doesn't change the game at all, especially if you terminate the game when no new loops of either color can be formed.

It strikes me that way too.

I'm glad you enjoy the ideas as much as I do. Oust (hex version of course) is one of my 3 favorite games other than Go (along with Catchup and Havannah). Your work is a huge part of why I wanted to be a game inventor. Thank you.

Thanks, Brian.  I guess Oust has turned out to be my most recognized game.  Or perhaps my only recognized game :)
