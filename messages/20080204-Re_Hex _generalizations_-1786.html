You can just about prove that Atoll is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> generalization of Hex.
Hex can't be played on a closed three dimensional surface, i.e. no
holes.  Box Hex, for example, (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/">http://www.marksteeregames.com/</a>
Box_Hex_rules.pdf) is played on the outer surface of a "box" but it
has an open top and so can be morphed into a 2D shape.

Call this an "inspiration" for a proof.  If you have a globe with the
equator divided into four segments, two black and two white, Black can
make a connection across the Northern hemisphere and White can make a
connection across the Southern hemisphere.  Now, assumptions here are
that there are at least two black "zones", for lack of a better word,
and two white zones.  And that both players have equal goals.

Hex has to be played on a 2D surface, and the black and white zones
have to be on the perimeter.  They must also be contiguous,
alternating black and white.  There can't be any "blank" zones.
Again, to emphasize, you can only play on one side of a two
dimensional surface or you'd have something equivalent to the globe.

You could print a Hex board on a rubber sheet with no tessellation,
only the colored perimeter segments, morph it into some other 2D shape
and then add tessellation, but this wouldn't do anything to further
generalize it.

The only thing you can really do to vary this is to further divide the
perimeter segments, increasing the number to larger multiples of four
and continue to connect opposite, like-colored segments.  You need to
add the little trick of allowing indirect connections via multiple,
separate bridges linking multiple, like-colored segments so that you
can maintain the "filled board produces exactly one winner" property.
And you need that property.  Don't even talk to me about
"generalizations" of Hex that don't have that or don't have equal
goals.

I mean if you want to call Atoll <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>a<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> generalization of Hex, fine.  I'm
tired of arguing about it.  But personally I believe it can be proved,
along the lines of the above "inspiration", that Atoll is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
generalization of Hex.  I've got donuts to think about here.  Let's
move on.
