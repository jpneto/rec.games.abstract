This is a mix between Symple and Ketchup that occurred to me
yesterday.

Rules:

- There are two players: Black and White. The game is played on a
square or hex hex board, which is initially empty.

- Starting with Black, players take turns placing one or two stones on
empty spaces. On his first turn, Black can only place one stone.

- If a player extends any of his groups on his turn, his opponent may
place three stones on his next turn. As usual, a group is a set of
like-colored, (orthogonally) adjacent stones.

- When both players pass in succession, the game ends.

- A player's score is the sum of his stones on the board minus x times
the number of his groups. In case of a tie, the player passing first
wins. X must be an even number; 2 or 4 should be optimal.

----------

I haven't playtested this, so I don't know whether it's too simple to
actually work. Like Symple, this game provides an incentive to create
groups while punishing them in the score. As in Ketchup, said
incentive takes the shape of negative feedback.

Seems a smart mix :) I've spend the day on some accumulated household
tasks so I'm too tired now to consider it more closely, but it sounds
like an interesting concept in its own right. Wonder what Nick thinks.
