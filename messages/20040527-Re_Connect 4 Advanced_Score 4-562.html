<br>The closest thing to a 3-D version of Connect 4 is the game sold as 
"Score Four".&nbsp; Unlike 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe, the markers (beads) played in 
Score Four drop down to the base/bead beneath them.&nbsp; This makes the game 
similar to Connect 4, in which the checkers also drop down.&nbsp; I have 
found Score Four to be much more interesting to play than 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe.
<br>
<br>Since there are at most 16 possible moves in Score-Four, of which only 
about 4 to 8 are "good moves", it should not be hard to get a computer 
program to play an almost unbeatable game by using a standard min-max 
strategy with alpha-beta pruning.
