I post this out of curiosity.  I'd like to know what each of the game
designers here regards as his desert island game, among his own
designs.  If you could only play one of your games for the rest of
your life, which would you play, and why?  Help us to see inside your
game and understand where its richness lies.

easy for me with the basically 1 major game i "discovered" - Xong.
The random variation, of course.  maybe you should further clarify the
"desert island" aspects?

is there electricity? probably not.
is there internet?  NO!!!!!

materials to make the game equipment must come from coconut trees &amp;
other native elements, stones and sea shells?  drift wood.

probably ok, since that would create a whole other activity whilst you
await your "Rescue".


infact, now that i think about it,

i would use the opportunity to invent more games!!!!

Take ME there NOW!  Please!


wait - maybe inventing new games is apparently against the rules...

ok... Nomic, since that can allow all the above activity.
