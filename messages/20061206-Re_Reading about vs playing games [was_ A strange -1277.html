Thanks.  I think I've played Amazons before--and it is a pretty good
game.

I figure the thing to do is first choose a game, then stick to it and
practice it--and read up on it if there's literature available.  So,
that's what I did.  I chose chess because there's lots of good software
and literature and I've always liked the game.

Now I'm thinking I ought to drop NMM, decide between chess and
checkers, and just focus on improving at one game.  I've apparently
bitten off more than I can chew.

Well, as with all things in life, you need to find balance, and that's
something only you can really do.  The truth is (IMHO of course) that
truly excelling at any one of these games (at least to the level I get
the sense you would like to) would indeed take a lifetime...more than a
lifetime actually.  (BTW, I would argue that Chess has been obsolete
for some time.  I'm not a personal lover of Draughts, but it remains a
better game IMO).  Chess requires a vast amount of study and
memorization.  Kasparov and others on the International scene have had
to make great personal sacrifices to get to where they are and maintain
it.  I'm a graduate student, personally, and came very early to the
realization that certain of my profs may be absurdly knowledgeable and
talented, but they too made life-long sacrifices for that knowledge.  I
daresay the vast majority of people have neither the time nor intense
passion necessary to truly master certain of these areas.  That's not a
bad thing either =)  There is certainly more to life than Chess,
Bridge, or in my case Musicology.  I personally love abstract games and
am too a bit of a perfectionist and wish I could really excel at them,
but I've decided instead that I would just rather <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and let the
aptitude simply come over time.

As for choosing a handful of games to sort of "dedicate yourself" to, I
certainly wouldn't restrict yourself to Chess and Checkers.  Both are
ancient games that have been studied to death.  (Chess is one of those
games about which more books have been published than almost any other
subject.)  The current method of study really is primarily memorizing
past games with some actual calculation in the mid-game.  I started
down that path years ago and it just took all the "fun" away for me.
Draughts is better, but still a very "understood" game IMO.  That said,
you will certainly be able to easily find opponents for these games.
That will certainly be a factor in your decision.  As for other
abstracts, there are soooooooo many out there.  Many truly interesting
ones as well.  A quick glance at sites like Gamerz.net, Boardspace.net,
Superdupergames.org (check out our wiki Wishlist and Links sections for
even more) will show you that there's lots to choose from; most of them
won't have any literature on them either.  Perhaps you can be the first
(or one of the first) to write some =)  Again, none of this will feed
your family, but as far as recreation goes, I think abstracts is the
place to be.

Uhm, I apologize for my rant here.  I had no intention of typing this
much and I probably just muddied the waters, but there it is.  Best of
luck to you!
