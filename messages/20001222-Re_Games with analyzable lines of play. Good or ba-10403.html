Personally, I don't like games where the players can analyze the system.
This is particularly true if the person tries to analyze during his or her
move, thus bogging down the game.  A friend of ours gets really frustrated
when this happens and preaches "play the game, not the system."  And that's
so true.  It's supposed to be entertainment, so if one turns it into a
scholarly ritual of highest-rated possibilities, it's no longer fun.  I say
I want a game you can play quickly without super analysis and ride it out
to see who wins.

For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.
