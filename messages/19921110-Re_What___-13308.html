%I have no idea.  It has an interesting name, though.  Perhaps in view
%of the absence of a FAQ, we could postulate that it should at least
%cover the kinds of games that can be played in the abstract (i.e.,
%without a board.  Here's one I used to play in high school:

And then, we could form rec.games.surreal, with simple modifications to the
scenario outlined below:

%Everybody knows the rules of tic-tac-toe. So, assign a number to each
%of the squares thus:
%
%   1    |    2    |    3
%--------+---------+---------
%   4    |    5    |    6
%--------+---------+---------
%   7    |    8    |    9
%
%Each player picks a number to claim the square represented by that
%number. The other player does the same, until one wins. Thus, two
%people may be seen at the back of a bus, engaging in the following
%conversation:

P1  One.
P2   "A".
P1  Five.
P2   Giraffe.
P1  Plumbing?
P2   Oh, shit!  Because a house can't eat.
P1  The sound of one hand clapping.  I win!  Or did you?  Huh?
