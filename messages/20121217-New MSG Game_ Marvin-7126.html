Marvin rule sheet:

I test played Marvin a few times to see if it warranted a formal, graphical rule sheet, and, in my estimation, it did.  It has an interesting architecture with finite cycling, and for me that's sufficient.

Like Cephalopod, Marvin has a fair amount of zugzwang/tempo/"If only it was my turn right now," or "If only it wasn't my turn right now."  With zugzwang you basically have little sub-games of Nim cropping up throughout play.  Another designer (Luis) said he finds that characteristic undesirable in games.  Well so do I.  But I submit two retorts.  1. Every game has zugzwang..  It's only a matter of degree.  2. Not every game has to be "great".  A game can just be fun.

Cephalopod and many mancala games are best played fast - either with a timer or just by convention.  They aren't intended to be dragged out for hours with exhaustive analysis paralysis on every move.  As such there's a kind of "luck".  Those little Nim sub-games burn through quickly, with one player or the other luckily winning each of them, and play plods ahead.  As with Backgammon though, a game with real luck, usually the best player wins.

If every new game I design has to be as good as or better than Oust, I won't be releasing a whole lot of new games.  Like none.  It's not a matter of me being burned out, or that every major concept has already been discovered.  It's just the luck of the draw.  With Oust fortunately turning out to be one of the greatest games ever invented, the chance of me one-upping it is extremely remote.  Hence Shuffle, Squinch, Marvin...
