<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>sigh<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> - people, please!  This is another copyrighted game!  We cannot
legally post the rules to it.

I'll give a brief description, though, so you can tell if it's close to
your version:

There are, I think, only four pieces per side: two rooks and two
bishops (that ought to tell you right there if yours is close or
not...).  The board has, I think, sixteen small boards on it that you
move on.  Each board is a four by four square, but they are shown as
diamonds, "in perspective" as if they were stacked above each other and
next to each other.  You can move from the upper left corner of one
board to the upper left corner of the board below or above or to the
left or to the right - if you are moving your rook, that is.  A bishop
must stay on its own color, of course - it would move one square in
from the corner as it moved to the next board.

As you move your pieces, you leave a trail of chits in every space you
pass through.  (Each side has four different colored pieces, and four
different colored chits, making eight colors in all.  You can always
tell where each piece has travelled throughout the game.)  These chits
represent the fourth dimension in the game - the timeline, if you
will.  If you land on an enemy's chit, you captured him in the past.
If he had captured one of your pieces earlier in the game, but later on
his chit trail than you just captured him (this is obvious from
intersecting chit trails), then he never really captured your other
piece, and it is returned to the board where it had been taken!  It
gets messy . . .  but is a fun game.
