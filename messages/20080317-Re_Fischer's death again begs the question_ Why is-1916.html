If by `supporting evidence', you mean an occasion on which the method
of cheating that I described has been used, of course I can't provide
any supporting evidence!  We are discussing a hypothetical change to
the rules of chess that, to the best of my knowledge, has never been
used in a high-level tournament.

You are permitted to argue by analogy. Really I think if you think about it,

As a matter of fact, no, you're not.  Argument by analogy is a logical fallacy.  
You can illustrate by analogy, but you cannot build an argument on it, because you 
are equating two things that are not equal, and the differences may turn out 
to be significant.  Analogy can be a fruitful source of new ideas, but cannot
be regarded as solid evidence in favor of those ideas; that must be found
elsewhere.

you will conclude that changing the scoring does not create cheating 
possibilities
that aren't already present. So the absence of widespread cheating evidence
is meaningful.
