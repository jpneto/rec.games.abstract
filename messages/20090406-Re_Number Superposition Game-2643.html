Here is a simple game for any plural number of players.

This game is played on an m-by-m grid drawn on paper.

The first player to move places a 1 in any square of the grid.

Players thereafter take turns, each player placing the integer k in a
square adjacent to (and in the direction of above, below, right of, or
left of -- with restrictions {see below}) the square where the
previous player to move wrote the integer (k-1). (k increases:
1,2,3,4,5,...)

A player may put the integer in an empty square OR may write the
integer in a square that already has a single number in it -- but may
not write a number in a square that already has two numbers written in
it.

Nice concept.  The snake gets a dramatically improved life expectancy
(I'm guessing) since it can cross over itself (at least to a height of
2) and avoid dead ending.

A player may also not write a number in the square previously written
in by the player who moved before the last player to move.
(In other words: No U-turns. Any integer k cannot be placed in the
same square as the integer (k-2).)

A player who writes the second number in a square gets {the absolute
difference between the two numbers in the square} added to his/her
score.

The game continues until no more moves can be made.

Highest score wins, of course.

The anticlimactic, "fizzle out" game ending: Play ends when there are
no more moves and high score wins.  Yuck.  When you get a good
concept, take the next step and make a good game.  I think you can do
better.
