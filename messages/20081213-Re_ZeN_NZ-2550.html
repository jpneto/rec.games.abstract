No, it's just as well no-one has a problem with Mark's claims.

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>My<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> claims?  What about Free Y, the "most canonical game"?  It's
beyond preposterous.  It's pathological!

Be advised, Bill: The days of "Egos Gone Wild" are over.  Yes Bill,
you are entitled to a certain amount of ego.  But not <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much
ego.  It's like 12 pounds of shit stuffed into a 10 pound bag,
inflicting structural damage and overflow on the bag.  You can't get
near it without getting shit on yourself.

Let's face it, Bill.  You haven't really accomplished very much in the
39 years you've been involved with connection games. Your only truly
interesting contribution was Projex - at least that I know of.  Maybe
there's a hidden treasure trove somewhere - very well hidden.  Gem and
Free Y were mildly innovative.  After that it starts dropping off like
Niagara Falls, with Quappy Quax leading the plunge.  I think the
question is, What have you done lately?  You're resting on my laurels.
