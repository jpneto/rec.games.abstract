You said exactly: "Computer programs are not

Yes.

The quote in context is as follows.

"Consider one difference in how Kasparov and Deep Thought/Deep Blue
play chess.  In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov
by sacrificing a piece. [current] Computer programs are not supposed
to be able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-
mordem analysis, Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed
all possible variations at least up to the point where the computer
regained the sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice
the piece for strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones."

You can replace the sentence

"[current] Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons."

by

"Current computer programs haven't (yet?) shown an ability to
make sacrifices for strategic reasons."

without changing my meaning.

I was talking only about current computers.  The quoted paragraph
does not say nor imply anything about fundamental limitations of
computers that forever bar them from doing something.  I've
explained this before but you just didn't get it.  If for some
strange reason, substituting the suggested sentence changes the
meaning in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> mind, then realize that the modified paragraph
is what <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> mean by the original paragraph (assuming that you
are not also misreading the suggested equivalent statement!).


Now if you disagree with my meaning as expressed in the modified
paragraph, then feel free to say so.  But <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>PLEASE<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> stop posting
responses arguing against a position I do not hold; that is
incredibly annoying and frustrating.
