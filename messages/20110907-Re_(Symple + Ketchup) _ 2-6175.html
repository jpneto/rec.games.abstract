It's actually yours. I've only tweaked it.

Not in love with the win condition. It's good in the sense that it
will probably create the right tensions, but I prefer win conditions
which are simple enough and visual enough that you know who won by
glancing at the board, without calculation. Hex and other simple
connection games are my ideal here. Ketchup's win condition works for
me only because it's possible to play with a scoring track, which
keeps each player's status visual, and even that skirts the edge of my
preferences.

Counting stones, as in Go, also looks very natural to me. I think it's
impossible to create such tension without some way of counting, or, to
put it more precisely, with the posibility that large occupied areas
of the board will become useless at some stage of the game. In Go and
Symple (and Oust, which doesn't even need counting), every stone
counts, which is not the case in Hex and Byg, for instance. That's
probably the same reason why connection games are usually considered a
bit less deep than territorial games. The larger the board, the more
significant the difference will be. However, I agree with you that
further altering the score with a group penalty, even if simple, is
not the most elegant solution.

That said, I've always wondered how would Go be like with a "biggest
group wins" goal...

So a question for me is: what simple, visual win condition is most
naturally paired with your supercool mechanism to produce a good
game?

You can always play it with the Ketchup and Byg goal, but maybe that's
too similar to Ketchup (not sure if better or worse, though).

Corey Clark has been trying for a loooooong time to create a
connection game with just the right amount of coldness in it, and it
occurs to me that your mechanism might be the ticket. So while the Hex
connection goal is horrifically unoriginal, combined with your
feedback mechanism it might solve Corey's problem and make an
exquisite game.

But ideally, I'd like to think of an original win condition which is
the natural conclusion to a game with your mechanism, and which is
also visual.

Thanks, this gives me much food for thought. :-)
