<div class="moz-text-flowed">&nbsp;I found some time to go back and work on the java2 applet.
<br>&nbsp;The upshot is no more blinkety blinking.&nbsp; the downside is
<br>&nbsp;no other real progress.&nbsp; looks like the apache/tomcat
<br>&nbsp;interface is the way to go.&nbsp; But for now, it is ready for
<br>&nbsp;more test driving.&nbsp; it might be slow in places...and you
<br>&nbsp;do have to be accurate with your mouse.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;quick review: Xong is an abstract game for 2 players that
<br>&nbsp;appears to have solved the First Move Advantage Problem by
<br>&nbsp;breaking up each move into 2 parts.&nbsp; Like baseball, a Xong
<br>&nbsp;turn begins with the ball in the hands of the defense.&nbsp; The
<br>&nbsp;first part of the turn is done by having the opponent design
<br>&nbsp;and give you the piece you have to play.&nbsp; then you can play
<br>&nbsp;it anywhere it fits.&nbsp; then you design your opponent's piece
<br>&nbsp;and give it to him.&nbsp; since each piece has to be unique, they
<br>&nbsp;begin small and gradually get bigger until no more can fit.
<br>&nbsp;when that happens, 1 point is given instead of a piece.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;the applet will take a moment to load.&nbsp; you should see a
<br>&nbsp;random board generated with no moves made yet.&nbsp; Blue makes
<br>&nbsp;the first xoid (underwhelmingly the one-legged piece) and
<br>&nbsp;gives it to Red who then makes the first play.&nbsp; this is done
<br>&nbsp;by Blue clicking the center of a leg and then the center of
<br>&nbsp;the GIVE hex.&nbsp; Red can drag and click around the leg until
<br>&nbsp;he has it where he wants it.&nbsp; then he hits the COMMIT hex
<br>&nbsp;to finsh the play.&nbsp; now he designs the next xoid, usually
<br>&nbsp;the two-legger boomerang.&nbsp; when building a larger piece
<br>&nbsp;you can click a leg a second time to throw it away.&nbsp; the
<br>&nbsp;final built xoid must be all connected and made of vacant
<br>&nbsp;legs remaining on the board - the applet wont let you pick
<br>&nbsp;an occupied leg, but if you forget to connect them it will
<br>&nbsp;attempt to use only the upperrightmost part of it - which
<br>&nbsp;may then be a xoid already used, so you'll get a message in
<br>&nbsp;the browser status line.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;go ahead - give it a spin:
