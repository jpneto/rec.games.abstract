<br>Since "nice" Go boards are expensive a pal of mine looked into creating

<br>want to.&nbsp; It remains the case that we're not in the realm of
<br>unobtainable rocket science.

<br>I have learned from this thread:
<br>&nbsp; there are people in the US who want to buy 10x10 checkers boards
<br>&nbsp; they don't know how, or are unwilling, to find a supplier outside the 
US
<br>&nbsp; such boards can be manufactured in the US, for little effort
<br>
<br>This suggests a business opportunity.&nbsp; If I lived in the US, I might act 
myself.
