I have developped 3 abstract games for kids only with some characteristics :

- Not more than 3 choices for each move

- Tactics more than strategy

- Winning progressively by scoring points 

- Simple rules : not more than 3.

- Boards n*n where n &lt; 5

- No capture or easy way to capture

- Moving by swapping in any direction (one square forward, backward, left, right etc..)



Do you think there are some constraints other than those above which could help building an abstract game for kids only?

Or do you think that we can use existing abstract games (very known) with simplified rules?



A kid can play similar to tictactoe for example.

What I`m asking for is how to build new games kids could enjoy?

That's kind of a tough challenge.  Kids have a very limited attention span.  They'll probably end up throwing the pieces around the room, depending on how young they are.
