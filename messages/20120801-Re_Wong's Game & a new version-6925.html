@MarkSteere:

Scribe is one of the games already presents in the geeklist I've mentioned but thank you for suggesting it!

This feels like an attempt to force the kind of behavior we might expect from territory games like Go, without a real solid justification for why we would want that kind of behavior specifically. If you can think of a good reason for wanting the game to behave in that way, then it would be reasonable, but to me it seems like overkill.

@rozen: Without this rule I thought that the gameplay will be very monotonous: A player that surround a big area only wins 2 stones (corresponding to the 2 single-placement turns that the enemy will expend placing 2 stones inside that area). So invading will be too easy and the game becomes more tactical and less strategic.
 
But again, I'm reluctant to add rules without reason and that's why I'm willing to read your opinions about this rule. Maybe I'm completely wrong and invading a surrounded territory makes you loose not only this 2 initial stones but also the ones the enemy can play when the invasions gets closer to its frontier.

Any one else believes that this rules is not necesary at all?

--------------------

By the way, I've re-read the proposed additional rule after your message and it doesn't captures correctly what I was thinking...

The correct version is something like:

"A player cannot play in any region which is completely surrounded by enemy stones and (possibly) the edge of the board unless he already has at least one friendly stone inside that region."

Which is even more Go-like ;-)
