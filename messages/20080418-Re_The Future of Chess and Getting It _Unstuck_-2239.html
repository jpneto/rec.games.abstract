My take on Goedel's incompleteness theorems is that almost all
invocations of them are made by people who are ignorant of what
they mean.  For the record, they refer to the use of systems of
deduction to reason about themselves.  Since chess is not a system
of deduction, incompleteness is totally irrelevant.

No.  (By the way, it's `Stephen Hawking'.)

If one considers math to be the "language of everything" and rules
relate to math in this regard, and is the means by which a game
functions as a contained system, to say that, "No Godel's
Incompleteness Theorem has NOTHING to do with game rules in any
way", is to totally deny that math has anything to do with games,
game rules, etc...  It is a shallow conclusion used to shut up
conversation, rather than consider that maybe there is some overlap.

The argument `Goedel incompleteness is relevant to mathematics;
mathematics is relavant to chess; therefore, Goedel incompleteness is
relevant to chess' is flawed because relevance is not transitive.
Consider the equivalent argument obtained by replacing `Goedel
incompleteness' with, say, `differential calculus' or `quantum
mechanics'.

Goedel incompleteness applies to systems of reasoning that are
powerful enough to encode Peano arithmetic and chess is fundamentally
not such a system.  First and foremost, it is not a system of
reasoning.  That kills it right there.  Even if you can demonstrate
that it is a system of reasoning (for example, that logical
propositions can be coded as positions and the truth or falsity of
those propositions can be derived from the game-theoretic outcome of
the corresponding positions), there are only finitely many positions
so only finitely many propositions can be encoded and the system is
not powerful enough to code arithmetic.  Even if you try to use games,
rather than positions, the laws of chess can't count beyond fifty, so
you can't use back-and-forth movements of knights, for example, to
code numbers because any move that is valid after fifty wiggles is
valid after fifty-one.

If I say `The manufacturing of yoghurt has nothing to do with chess',
does that also totally ignore the issues involved with chess itself
and whether or not it can hit an ultimate state of being solved?  Is
this better or worse than totally ignoring the issues involved with
the applicability of Goedel's incompleteness theorems to areas outside
mathematical logic (of which there are almost none)?
