What???

Okay, let's assume that player 1 starts both parts of the game.
Let's assume that the x's are in the same locations as in my "optimal"
game above.
But I will renumber the grid so that each player takes the largest
possible number of points without any look-ahead. (Greedy algorithm.)

Then we have:
.. 3 . . . . .
.. . 5 . . . .
.. . . 7 . . .
.. . . . 2 . .
.. . . . . 6 .
.. . . . . . 4
1. . . . . .

Player 1 gets: 12+25+9 = 46 points.
Player 2 gets: 9+16+4 = 29 points.

Now, player 2 could know he is going to lose with the no-look-ahead
strategy. So what would happen if instead of placing the 3 where he
does, he places it in a different location, then both players continue
the game using the no-look-ahead Greedy "algorithm"?

.. 5 . . . . .
.. . 3 . . . .
.. . . 7 . . .
.. . . . 2 . .
.. . . . . 6 .
.. . . . . . 4
1. . . . . .

Player 1 gets: 12+16+16 = 44 points.

Player 2 gets: 4+25+4 = 33 points.

Player 1 still wins, but by fewer points.

So, I am guessing that if player 2 is going to win the n = 7 case, he
may need to place his x's in different locations in the first part of
the game.

So, the question is, is this a stupid game? What if there are more
players or if the grid is bigger?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
