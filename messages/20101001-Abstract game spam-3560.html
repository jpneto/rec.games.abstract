 Atreso

Overview  Atreso is an abstract [snip total snoozfest]"

What do you expect me to do with your arbitrary, way too complicated
game?

The God-give-me-cancer class of games is growing at an alarming rate.
What's that game where you actually have to perform multiplication?
What could possibly be more cumbersome in a game?  I really hate
tiebreaker rules for games that can fail to establish a winner via
their primary objective, such as the last person to move in a tie
wins.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Zero<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> architecture.  What's that toy game, Ponte something?
If there's no single majority of islands then the object defaults to
majority of bridges.  Yuck.

Atreso rules:

Overview  Atreso is an abstract strategy board game for two players.
The objective is for a player to either advance a chip to the row
closest to his opponent or to make it impossible for his opponent to
move.

 Equipment  Every Atreso game comes with a 10 by 10 square board, 25
white chips, 25 black chips, 5 white stones, 5 black stones, 10 grey
stones, and one die.

Setup  The game begins with an empty board.  Both players roll the
die.  The player with the higher roll takes the white pieces, and the
other player takes the black pieces.  The player with the white pieces
then places exactly one piece on each square on the three rows closest
to himself.  Then the player with the black pieces places his pieces
on the board in a similar fashion.  Players then alternate turns,
starting with white.

Player turn  There are two phases to a players turn.  During the
first phase, the player moves one of his pieces.  During the second
phase, if at least one grey stone is not on the board, then the player
must place a grey stone on an empty square that has at least one empty
square adjacent to it.

Movement  Stones can move one of two squares forward, backward, left,
or right, or move one square diagonally.  If a stone moves two
squares, then it does not land on the square between its starting
square and ending square, and it cannot move through pieces.  Chips
can only move one square forward, left, or right.  At most one stone
can be on a square.

Groups  A player can create a group by moving one of his chips onto
another one of his chips.  Chips can move onto or off groups.  There
is no maximum group size.  Groups cannot move.

Capturing  If a chip or stone lands on an opposing chip, then the
chip that was landed on is captured.  If a stone lands on an opposing
stone, then both pieces are captured.  If a chip lands on an opposing
stone, then the chip is captured if a 1, 2, 3, or 4 is rolled, and the
stone is captured if a 5 or 6 is rolled.  If a chip lands on an
opposing group, then the chip is captured if a 1, 2, 3, or 4 is
rolled, and the group is captured if a 5 or 6 is rolled.  If a stone
lands on an opposing group, then the group is captured if a 1, 2, 3,
or 4 is rolled, and the stone is captured if a 5 or 6 is rolled.

Grey stones  Grey stones cannot move.  Pieces cannot land on or pass
through grey stones.  A grey stone is removed if none of the squares
adjacent to it are empty.

End of the game  If a player advances a chip to the row closest to
his opponent, then he wins the game.  If a player cannot move when it
is his turn, then he loses.  If the same position is created with the
same player to move as has been created twice before, then the game
ends in a draw.
