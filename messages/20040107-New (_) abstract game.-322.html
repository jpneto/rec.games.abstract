Joao Neto and myself have discovered a new abstract board game, which seems
so natural that I'm sure it must have been discovered before.

We initially played it on a hexagonal board, but it seems just as adaptable
to rectangular, which we are trying now.

The original is like so:-

   . . . .      Obviously the size is variable, to taste.
  . . . . . 
 . . . . . .    There is only one "live" piece, the x, starting in the centre 
.. . . x . . .   as shown.
 . . . . . .
  . . . . .     The players move it around, moving alternately as usual.
   . . . .

A move is any (positive) number of cells in any of the 6 directions,
as long as they are all free.

KEY POINT: every cell travelled over or landed on, cannot ever be landed on
or travelled over again.  So it is a bit like the racing in "Tron".
One can imagine the "x" leaves a trail of impenetrable slime.
(In fact the game is the well-known "Slimetrail", but with long moves legal.)

Whoever first cannot move, loses.

   . . . .    
  . . . . . 
 . . . . . . 
.. . . o o x .  player 1 has moved 2 east.
 . . . . . .
  . . . . . 
   . . . .

   . . x .    
  . . . o . 
 . . . . o . 
.. . . o o o .  player 2 moved 3 northwest.
 . . . . . .
  . . . . . 
   . . . .

   . . o .    
  . . o o . 
 . . o . o . 
.. . o o o o .  player 1 moved 4 southwest.
 . x . . . .
  . . . . . 
   . . . .

   . . o .    
  . . o o . 
 . . o . o . 
.. . o o o o .  player 2 moved 1 southeast.
 . o . . . .
  . x . . .    Note that player 1 can move only 1 step northeast from here,
   . . . .     not 3 or 5.   Or of course, 1 West or SW or SE, or 1/2/3 East.

Because first-stymied is the loser, this is clearly a "standard" type of
Nimmish game, a la "Winning Ways", though I don't recall ever seeing it
noted there.  Theoretically, the first mover (probably, for most sizes)
has a sure win, but it would take Deep Yellow to work out what it was.

When the remaining reachable areas become small or thin, ordinary CGT
analysis would apply.

........

So anyway, has anyone ever heard of such a game?  And whether or not you have,
give it a whirl - it's a lot of fun!  And maybe an eventual member of
Richard's play-by-email server?
