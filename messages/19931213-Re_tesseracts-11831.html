   ok, i talked with one of my more mathematically inclined friends tonight and
   we decided it was easier to consider each node of the hypercube as a room, 
   as opposed to my original idea of each edge of the hypercube being one wall
   of a given room.
   we came up with the following arrangement, presuming you number the nodes
   arbitrarily from 1 to 16 and conside the edges between the nodes as the 
   passages between the nodes.  
     1 maps to 2,3,4,9
     2 maps to 1,6,7,10
     3 maps to 1,5,7,11
     4 maps to 1,5,6,12
     5 maps to 4,3,8,13
     6 maps to 4,2,8,14
     7 maps to 3,2,8,15
     8 maps to 5,6,7,16
    and 9-16 are symmetric to 1-8

   can anyone verify if this is correct?  
   thanks,
    -the count

I don't usually read this group, but I do know about numbering hypercubes.
Of course you can arbitrarily number the cube, but the normal method, which
makes it easier to work with, it to start with 0, and make each direction
represented by a bit.  Thus connected to 0 would be (in binary)
  0001 0100
    | /
  0000-0010
     \
      1000 (fourth dimension)

by inverting each of the four bits, you get the four neighbors, if you 
want the neighbor in the up direction, invert the bit in the up direction.
0 connects to 1,2,4,8

1 to 0,3,5,9
2 to 0,3,6,10
3 to 1,2,7,11
4 to 5,6,0,12
5 to 4,7,1,13
6 to 7,4,2,14
7 to 6,5,3,15
etc.

If your making these room, then each bit could be wall with a door
and each edge a door.
