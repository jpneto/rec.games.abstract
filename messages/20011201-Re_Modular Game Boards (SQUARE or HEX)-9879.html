(Nathan Sanders asked about availability of modular chess boards)

I'm working on such a project: put 12x12 1" square wooden tiles into a
suitable tray and stain/color only one face of each tile.  Turn over
border tiles to clearly delineate the area in play.  Variations possible.

Ditto hex board -- except it is a holy grail to find non-ceramic hexagonal
tiles (but I have found the holy grail -- see below).

My motivation was that I would rather display and use a single nice board
than a multitude of paper ones.  I thought about patenting this idea but...
:-)

Peaceful Resistance is an interesting abstract board game invented by
Dave Thornburg that comes with 144 (!) small wooden hex tiles, no less.
(1 3/16" diameter).  A couple sets will be enough for a size-10 hexagonal
board or a size-17 Hex board (diamond-shaped, short one hex).  The game
itself is elegant in the use of 3D dynamic terrain -- I think it has
great potential especially on a larger board (so I bought three sets
wholesale...).  More later.

Here's another idea for making modular boards that I got from looking at
my kids' school crafts.  Weave 1" wide paper strips criss-cross,
over-under fashion, voila.  This would look a little odd for hex board
(actually, the dual, triangle board) unless one also drew in some lines.
But I bet it can be done attractively.
