What the fuck does Genesis have to do with Oust?  Genesis isn't even a game..  You just set up an initial arrangement and let an algorithm play out.

Of course I know Othello.  This is the best you can do for Oust similarity?  Genesis and Othello?  I'm really disappointed, Abadoucha.

- Drawless games. You are too dumb to understand that a game with one

What you're too dumb to understand, Abadoucha, is that nobody plays optimally.  Game theory neophytes always get hung up on optimal play.  If play is optimal, there's something wrong with your game.  Tic-Tac-Toe for example.  The tiny board facilitates optimal play, making Tic-Tac-Toe a non-game.  Nim, for example.  There's a simple system for optimal play.  Again, it's a non-game.

Imperfect play is necessary for a game to work properly.  Without imperfection, there is no intuition.  Only a memorizing of cataloged moves.  Play should consist of a series of educated guesses.  Whichever player is better at this will win most of the time.

Tell you what.  I'll challenge you to a two game Oust match at iggc, and let's see who wins both games.  Unless you're a gameplay expert, which seems highly unlikely since you're an idiot, I'll win both times.

So what??  As long as the players don't have access to the general solution, they can play the game normally.

Fair solution not pie or swap rule. Pie rule is fake solution. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pie rule isn't intended to make a game perfectly balanced.  There will still be a second move advantage, though smaller in magnitude (in most games) than the turn order advantage without pie.

Mathematical solution!!! I will not give it you. Try to find it.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Seeking perfection in games is misguided.  Perfection is unnecessary.  Ideally, a game is scalable, such as Oust, which is usually played on a 7x7x7 board.  Turn order advantage is statistically consistent with zero percent.  Someday, if players become expert enough, and if turn order advantage emerges, we may have to switch up to an 8x8x8 board, bringing turn order advantage back down to virtually zero.  

In order for a game like Oust to be perfectly balanced, the board would have to be infinitely large, making it a non-game.  You want the board to be large enough to where turn order advantage is negligible, but small enough to where the game doesn't take forever to play.

I had to go through all this with Christian Freeling, who sincerely believed that his game Symple was "perfectly balanced".  In the end he had to admit that Symple is no more balanced than Hex with pie.  Of course it wasn't that easy.  I had to let him drive himself into a logical brick wall over and over again for more than a year, but finally he'd had enough.

Eliminate and annihilate your opponent. There are mathematical

Oh brilliant.  An undecidable game where nobody wins.  Good luck with that shit.

If you take into account the time factor I mean the sequential 
playing during the game. At the instant t1 player 1 win (those 
are examples) but at the instant t2 the player 2 win. In optimal
conditions. At my knowledge no one until know invented such game 
except me. You eliminate almost all your opponent pieces but few 
and your opponent will annihilate all your pieces but few .... and 
so on. The game will never [end?] unless you rule timing. The winner 
is the one who win one hour from now (for example).

Perfect.  An infinite game that is cut short by a timer.  I have no interest in the details of this game.  It fails miserably on aesthetic grounds.

You're just a fucking douche who knows nothing about games and nothing about game theory.  Get your fucking head out of your ass for once in your shit brain life.
