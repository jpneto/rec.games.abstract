I've considered the 3-d version somewhat, and it has occured (to be at least) 
that a cubic 3-d board may have too many liberties per node.  This means
that it will be much harder to actually threaten/kill pieces.  You can
get a feel for this by playing on a triangular 2-d grid (both have internal
nodes with 6 neighbours).  The overall effect is that IMHO the game loses
playabliliy because stones have so many liberties.  In fact 4 neighbours 
may be the optimal number for a good game, as the hexagonal board (with
3 neightbours for internal nodes) creates a situation where it's much
harder to keep stones alive (and very easy to threaten).  Therefore, you 
may want to consider a tetrahedral based board for 3-d go, if you
want to maintain it's current balance.  Of course, it's much harder
to take anything you've learned from 2-d go over to tetrahedrons, than
it would be to a cubic based board.
