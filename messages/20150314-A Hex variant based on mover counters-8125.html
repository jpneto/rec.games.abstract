As I was thinking to the "A game in progress" I had a quick idea.
Let us play Hex this way :

- On hex board 11*11 there are 121 cells. Assume that each player place alternatively 6 stones per cell in the first phase of the game. All the 120 stones will be placed on the board.

- Then player start alternatively placing one stone per turn choosing any stack of stones. The first one to connect win the game.

Will it be an interesting gameplay as result?
Will it end for sure by a connection? (120 out of 121)

Let me know your thinking even if I hate the variants.
Variants are JUST FOR TRAINING in my point of view.
But variants are MAYBE the best way to uncover new mechanics.
