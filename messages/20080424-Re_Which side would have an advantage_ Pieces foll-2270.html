This should be very easy to check. All chess programs worth a penny
let you set up arbitrary positions, from your description, that
would be sufficient (when setting up a king on the second row, it
naturally won't be able to castle, and a pawn on the third row won't
be able to move to the fifth). Take a seriously strong program, make
it play without an opening book, and see which side wins more often.

Actually, you don't need to disable the opening book -- no opening
book will contain any of the positions that arise in the first twenty
or so moves of this game so having the opening book switched on will
make no difference.  This is just the same as your observation that
castling and double pawn moves don't need to be explicitly disabled.
