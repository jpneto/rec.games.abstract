Most of what you see in Chess as what seems to be odd rules (En
Passant, Castling, etc...) all stem from solutions to problems that
arise when other changes were made to the game.  Like the added
mobility of pieces resulted in these changes coming about.  What I
personally believe now is that chess is locked into by the way things
are that changes can't get into chess at all, due to the way the
current political, and mental framework of chess is set up.  It no
longer has much ability to come up with En Passant and Castling to add
new changes, as it is framed now, and the political climate.  I doubt
there is even the potential to do it.

In general, what is percieved as a "problem" with a board game <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a
matter of taste. The rule in Checkers that capturing is compulsory can
be viewed as a problem. Why should one have to make a move that is
disadvantageous, doesn't that go directly against the point of a game
of strategy? That's one of the reasons some people go on to Chess, and
why a draw for the opening moves was considered an acceptable way of
dealing with stereotyped games in Checkers, while it would be unlikely
to be acceptable to the Chess community for their game.

"Problem" here is seen in quotes regarding en passant.  It is seen as
inelegant.  It is designed by necessity.  What is seen, as you
discuss, is that the approaches that checkers take, are seen as
unacceptable.  They don't flow out of the nature of the game at all.
One could say the same with attempts to handicap.  There isn't a
handicapping system in chess at all, because of the way it is now.
People suggest messing around with time control, giving the more
experienced player less time.  But is this seriously used in any way?

I also remember, back in the 8-bit computer era, a computer checkers
game advertised which, for some bizarre reason, played Continental or
Polish draughts. Had it been advertised in a European magazine, that
wouldn't have been odd, but only natural, but this was advertised by
an American firm to American customers in an American magazine, and in
the English-speaking United States, that game is virtually unknown. If
you want equipment, you would have to draw your own 10 by 10 board on
a piece of cardboard - that sort of unknown.

And this here is another reason why any changes have a hard time
getting adopted, particularly the likes of Capablanca chess.  You
don't have the expanded board available, so few can actually play it
and try it.  Thus it doesn't catch on.
