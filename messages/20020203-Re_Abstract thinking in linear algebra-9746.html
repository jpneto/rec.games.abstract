Perhaps later down the road. Students find concepts such as

"vector spaces",
"subspaces",
"axioms",
"general inner product",
"linear transformation in a general vector space"
and others

quite abstract. Also, the students are deprived of
(shielded from? protected from?) formal proofs in Calculus.
Frankly, when I came to North America, I found the very
existence of Calculus shocking, with its cookbook approach.
Why do they avoid Year I Real Analysis? (That study would,
by the way, do away with many misunderstandings about 0
.999... and other phony issues.)

This allows institutions (such as the one that I am currently attending)
to put <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>everyone<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> through calculus, like it or not.  My fiancee is an
English major, and she would scream if she had to do real analysis (and
I would scream if I had to teach it to her).  Of course, this is a huge
deal in the reform calculus movement--getting students to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>understand<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
rather than just <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>memorize<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (or, if I were being cynical, to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>feel<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
rather than be able to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>).  (To be fair, I can be just as cynical
about the "cookbook" approach as well.  What can I say--I'm just a
cynical guy.)

:Why do they
:make you go through Calculus before taking linear algebra?

That depends on your school's Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.
In our school, these two subjects are offered concurrently.
Some schools may adopt the condescending attitude "you know, the
students are not ready for linear algebra".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's interesting: here at Duke, the linear algebra course is (or can be)
concurrent with multivariate calculus--but the honors linear algebra is
listed as a "continuation" of the honors multivariate class (and so must
be taken after it).

:And what's the difference between linear and normal algebra?

I will not guess what "normal" algebra is. In today's terminology,
linear algebra is simply a part of algebra. In high-school speech,
"algebra" can, and should, contain teaching skills useful for
handling problems from Calculus and from Linear Algebra, as well
as from more advanced subjects.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, there's algebra and there's algebra.  In high school (and at some
"college algebra" classes) algebra means solving polynomials (99.85% of
the time linear and quadratic) and doing some basic analytic geometry
(circles, parabolas, what not).  The really advanced of these algebra
classes get into small systems of equations (probably where you learned
to solve them).  In college, "algebra" deals with, well,
"algebras"--sets and operations on them (groups, rings, fields, etc).
Linear algebra fits into this in a natural way, and matrices are the
"canonical" examples of linear operators in algebra.

Hope it helps, ZVK(Slavek).

You learn something new every day--I didn't even know there was a group
called rec.games.abstract.  Did you just do a Google search for NGs with
"abstract" in them, or have you been reading the group?
