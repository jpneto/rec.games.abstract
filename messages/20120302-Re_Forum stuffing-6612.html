Graham, I like you and I appreciate the effort you've put into
Redstone thus far.  But don't show up at rec.games.abstract

That's why they're new.

It's not entirely clear what your point is - new people cease

New sheriffs cease being here after they've been around for a day.  You're

Redstone is interesting, and whilst it's hard to judge it's merits

Thanks.  I am interested in how Redstone's depth compares to Go's but I'll
have to learn Go to some degree to even understand the explanation.

Atoll I suspect will not be as popular as Hex, for the simple
reason that Hex was around first, and Atoll adds a layer of
goal complexity that hex doesn't have.

Agreed.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
For what it's worth, I think Atoll is a better game,

A lot of people have said exactly that.  Atoll won't be as popular as Hex
but it will eat up a much larger piece of the pie eventually.  And by
eventually, I mean a time scale of centuries, not decades.

One trend I do see is the desire for simplicity. Go is popular
because it's simple to learn, and Redstone adds a fair amount
of complexity to the way the game develops.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's hugely positive to me.  Less complex rules (without ko), more complex
gameplay.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Why play Redstone when you can play Go?

I could ask you the same thing in reverse.  Complexity isn't a bad thing. 
Games wouldn't be games without it.

Oust is both extremely simple to learn, and appears
somewhat deceptively deep, and doesn't look like a
close ripoff of another game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No game is more original than Oust.  I generally don't specialize in
variants at all, except for my connection games, which, as you said, are
related to Hex.  That's why I had such a non-appreciation of Redstone at
first.  It was just a variant.  But, it's apparently a king among variants,
so now I'm interested.

I can't see any justification for [Oust] being superior to Go however.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course you can't, Graham, and you never will.  No offense, but you wear
your Go-centrism like a bullfighter's poncho.  Why would anyone ever play
anything but Go? lol  Objectively, there's a lot of ongoing sente/gote in
Go.  There's a lot of that in Tanbo too.  In Oust, you do have to be mindful
of sente in the opening game.  White definitely starts out in gote.  But
once he safeties a stone, White is no longer in gote, and the sente/gote
issue pretty much disappears.  You definitely don't have players drawing out
the next twelve moves for each other.  Automatic moves exist in all games. 
They're more the rule than the exception in Go.  In Oust, automatic moves
are a rarity.

In our private discussion (sorry, but in the interests of time) I think you
said there's no such thing as a world renowned abstract game designer.  Of
course, abstract games are extremely esoteric.  But, if you're a connoisseur
of abstract games, you've heard of me and Christian.  If you haven't, you're
not a connoisseur.

I really don't believe Oust will compete on that scale,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, Oust will compete on that scale, given the passage of enough centuries,
simply because it's a better game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
but my initial reaction when seeing a claim that a game is
vastly superior to games with such overwhelming popularity
is that the spokesman doesn't know what he's talking about

Yes, yes, yes, I'm an idiot.  I'll concede that so we don't have to
endlessly return to the topic.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I suspect Oust will be much easier for an AI to play than
Go or Chess,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You're outstandingly wrong on that point, Graham.  Go absolutely has a
larger game tree.  But practically speaking, most of that tree never gets
used.  In Go you typically capture a handfull of singletons during the
course of a long, relatively tame game.  Oust, by comparison, is much more
aggressive.  Larger groups do get captured regularly.  Practically speaking,
the statement "It never plays the same way twice" holds truer in Oust than
in Go.  In Go, an expert player can remember all of the moves in the game. 
That'd be a lot more difficult in Oust.  I believe that the practical play
portion of Oust's tree is larger than Go's.

Add to that that Oust is counterintuitive.  You can get down to one stone
against tens of enemy stones and come back and win.  You often have to "lose
in order to win" in Oust.  Difficult as Go is to program, Oust will be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
harder.

which to me detracts from my long term hopes for it.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Forgive my bluntness, Graham, but I don't care about your long term hopes
for Oust.  My ego as a world renowned abstract game designer is much larger
than your ego as a dan level Go player.

Outta time.  I'll be back....
