I've never seen a pente match get anywhere near the edge of the board, it seems there's just too many possibilities.  Are there patterns to the defense which
can guarentee the game will extend from the center out to the edge?  Could
perhaps the question of a generalized go-moku solution be one of minimum
moves for a sure win, rather than board size?


Like, a tree for a sure win on an infinite plain in 200 moves?  The infinity of the board would not be that huge of a problem:  The play in a region would
of course center around the first stone played there, and the first player to
play in an area would of course have some sort of "initiative" there.



Or is filling the board with a stone every three crosses actually a good
go-moku strategy?
