Hexiamonds:
-----------
There are 12 hexiamonds. Has anyone made figures from two sets of hexiamonds?

I constructed some figures for the 48 problem for this set.

48-Problem:
Divide the 24 hexiamonds into 3 groups of 8 each. Find a 48-triangle region
that each of the three groups will cover.

The analog 24-Problem for one set of hexiamonds has ca. 50 different regions.

Are there games played with hexiamonds (one or more sets) on the market?
The 'Triangel Team', a one person and his family company, will make
several two and more person games for two sets of hexiamonds. They
will be cuts from wood. The game will be presented at the fair:

  Spiel 93, Essen, (Germany).  21.-24.10.93

This fair is the biggest of this kind in Europe. It is open for everyone.
As 'spiel' means 'game' and 'play!', you actually shall play the games.
