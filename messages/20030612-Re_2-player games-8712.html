Go, pente, connetrix, Go-Moku Pente (btw all connect4 variants), twixt, all
battleboat variants, go on a small board 9x9, the big board variants are

You can, though, play one-capture Go in which the first capture wins the

Yes, the following rant has little to do with the Real World.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The inability to erase bridges would by itself make draws more likely. But
at Little Golem, the variant played allows crossing of one's own bridges
instead of erasing the old bridges. I think if you're limited to a
pen-and-paper version, that's a better one.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, the version of Twixt used at Little Golem, where you may cross your
own links, probably results in fewer draws than standard Twixt, where
you may remove your own links. In one game I played there, we ALMOST
entered an endgame where I could have won relatively easily under LG
rules, but my opponent could have cleverly forced a draw under standard
rules. I'm glad my purist ethic was not put to the test. I suspect it
would not have fared well.

But I still hope LG will "mend its ways" and implement the standard
ruleset someday. I have three reasons:

1. Alex Randolph's concept should not be altered. (I should add that
   the LG webmaster calls the game "Twixt PP," for pencil &amp; paper,
   so at least he isn't claiming he has Twixt.)

2. Maybe draws become less common in Twixt PP, but link removal adds
   more complexity, and to me, more beauty to the game. It's too easy
   if you can just cross yourself and win. Some of the puzzles at
   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/Twixt/puzzles.html">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/Twixt/puzzles.html</a>
   show the clever tricks and traps that can occur when links are
   removed. Those puzzles would not work if you can cross yourself.

3. There are also positions which are a win under standard Twixt but
   a loss under Twixt PP. See
   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/TwixtPP.html">http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/TwixtPP.html</a>
   Such positions might be exceedingly rare, but they could happen.
