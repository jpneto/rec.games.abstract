iago

Iago harms abstract games.  Or, more specifically, iago president,
Richard Hutnik, harms abstract games.  Richard Hutnik has tirelessly
campaigned, since the inception of iago, to destroy the very concept
of what an abstract game is.

Tactic of the con man: find the victim's weak point and exploit it.
The "weakness" of the abstract game is that there's no universally
accepted precise definition.  Richard Hutnik exploits this by saying,
essentially, "Well, since there's no real consensus, abstract games
will be whatever I want them to be."

Definition of abstract game according to Richard Hutnik, essentially:
"What's left over."  Abstract games are what's left over after War
Games, Eurogames, Amerigames, etc.  Abstract games are the misfits - a
gigantic class of games that can't be classified any other way.  And
not just boardgames.  No.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>All<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games.  Bouncing quarters for beer,
Pin the Tail on the Donkey, Writhing naked in the snow...  abstract
games, one and all.

Proposed iago motto: "Iago, where lawn darts is an abstract game."

To Richard Hutnik, abstract games are the garbage class of games.  You
can see this in an earlier post where Hutnik, incredibly, refers to
the announcement of new abstract games in an abstract games forum as
"dumping games".  This would be horrendous from anyone involved with
abstract games in any way, never mind the actual president of the
International Abstract Games Organization.  Richard Hutnik openly
disrespects the very art he claims to promote!!  Hutnik's own game,
Dipole Chess, is a variant of an MSG game, Dipole - a game I "dumped"
in rec.games.abstract.

You'd think the president of the International Abstract Games
Organization would work to make abstract games more <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exclusive<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and
less <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>inclusive<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, but no.  Richard Hutnik is the high school slut of
game promotion.  He just wants to make everyone happy.  Hutnik says
he's only being "diplomatic" while gripping his ankles.

Richard Hutnik is now preaching to a big group of ninnies in the bgg
abstract games forum, ninnies who already believe that the abstract
game is "whatever you want it to be".  At BoardGameGeek, the de facto
definition of abstract game is literally that someone checked the
"Abstract game" box on the game submission form.

Most bgg members are as stupid as a bag of artichokes, especially when
it comes to abstract games.  It won't take long for Richard Hutnik to
convince them that abstract games are whatever Richard Hutnik wants
them to be.

Case in point, and this is fucking aggravating.  Yesterday on bgg,
Richard Hutnik said:

"In the case of this here, anyone care to give their two cents
regarding Batik. It isn't a purely combinatorial game, but feels like
an abstract strategy game to me."

That's Hutnik-speak for "I'm planning to add Batik to my list of 'iago
certified' abstract games, unless anyone seriously objects.  Remember,
I just want to make everyone happy."

An "iago certified" game is like "bull certified" shit.

Batik:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.educationallearninggames.com/how-to-play-batik-game-rules.asp">http://www.educationallearninggames.com/how-to-play-batik-game-rules.asp</a>

If you include Batik, you include lawn darts.  Not that I give a shit
what games Richard Hutnik includes in his list.  Laughably, Hutnik
actually threatens me from time to time with removing my games from
his list.  In fact he did remove my games once for a time and then put
them back in.

It's laughable because iago needs me a lot more than I need iago.  I
don't need iago for shit.  I hope Richard Hutnik does remove my games
from iago's bullshit list.  I don't want my games on the same list as
Batik and lawn darts.

The comedic value of an iago without MSG games would be inestimable.
Imagine, after you can't add Cephalopod to the database, Richard
Hutnik explains to you why Cephalopod can't be an iago certified
abstract game.

Possible future memo from Richard Hutnik:

"Here at iago, we consider not only the quality of the game itself,
but the quality of the designer as well, in a more general sense.  In
the case of MSG games, we just felt that designer Mark Steere wasn't
quite up to snuff.  Therefore, while we'd like to extend our paid
certification program (make check payable to Richard Hutnik Marketing
Enterprises, Inc.) to Mark Steere and his games, in good conscience,
we really can't."

The defining characteristic of iago is and always has been sheer
spinelessness.  Or, looking at it another way, iago's problem is
Richard Hutnik.

On April 30, 2010, Richard Hutnik had this to say:

"It doesn't matter if I am a founder or not, if I am a problem I take
myself out of the way."

Take yourself out of the way, Rich.  Take yourself out of the forums.
You're not <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>a<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> problem.  You're <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> problem.

Rich, I'll tell you exactly what you need to do from here on out.
1. Pull your head out of your ass hole.
2. Extract the thick wax plugs from your ear holes.
3. Use the wax to clog your pie hole.

Rich, you are on the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> bottom of the food chain.  You're like a
cop sent to prison for child rape.  When someone tells you what to do,
do it.  When someone tells you lose the caps in IAGO, lose the fucking
caps in IAGO.  If Phil Carmody tells you what to do (sorry Phil, but
you're going to be needed from time to time), fucking do it!

Rich, we are not colleagues.  My colleague is a world class
programmer.  My colleague is a world class player.  My colleague is a
world class designer.  Which one are you, Rich?
