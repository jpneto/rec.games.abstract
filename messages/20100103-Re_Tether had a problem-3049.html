Would it be more likely that one player or both would cordon off
territory if it were played on a different board geometry? On the
hexagonal grid it takes a minimum of 6 stones to surround one, but
perhaps playing on squares, or the MacBeth geometry, would make this
work better.

Hi Mark.  There are undoubtedly a variety of schemes for making pseudo
draws less likely to occur in Tether, including bigger boards.   Its
also a virtual certainty that advancing skill will have the opposite
effect, making pseudo draws increasingly likely.  In any case, if its
even possible for a game to draw (or pseudo draw) between non-
cooperating players, I dont want that game.

Infinity minus Tether is still infinity.  Therell be more to come.
Im keeping my fingers crossed on Mosaic.  I tested it out more
extensively than Tether, but you never really know.
