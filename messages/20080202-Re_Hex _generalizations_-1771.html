Hmm, can Y be generalized in an Atoll-like fashion?

Yes, Y can be generalized and has been generalized - by me.  I call
the generalization of Y Begird:

If so, then would
you accept (Atoll + Atoll-like generalization of Y) as a generalization
of both Hex and Y?

No.  Atoll is the generalization of Hex and Begird is the
generalization of Y.  That's the extent of it.

By the way, someone here said I was upset because I expected Atoll to
be met with accolades and it wasn't.  Believe it or not, I'm not quite
that stupid.  I knew Atoll would be a big, bitter pill.  People in a
given field automatically reject major discoveries in that field, at
least initially.  It'll take people at least a decade to accept Atoll
as the generalization of Hex.

I half expected Atoll to be deleted from Hexwiki.  The so-called
"editors" (pronounced with a chuckle) surprised me though by not being
quite as dick headed as I thought.  They put Atoll into the variants
category which I knew for a fact they'd do if they kept it.  As I
mentioned earlier, Atoll is the generalization of Hex, not a variant
of Hex.  A set is not a variant of one of its members.
