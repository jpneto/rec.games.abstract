i own a shogi set and play it whenever i can (not many people here at
rutgers who do play it...).  though i have never played hasami shogi.

shogi is played on a nine by nine board where the pieces (which are
tiles tapered towards the top) are the same color, the direction of
the tile determining who it belongs to.  this is because whenever 
you capture a piece, you can, on a later turn, instead of moving 
one of your pieces, place a piece you have captured on the board
as one of your own.

it is otherwise a good deal like chess:
the object is to capture the enemy king.
capture of pieces is by moving your piece into the same square as
the opponents piece.

not a whole lot more to it other than if you manage to get one of 
your pieces into any of the last three rows, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>may<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> promote it,
and also the movement of the pieces is different.

but it is the ability to place captured pieces as your own that
makes it so very interesting.

there is an x-go server which supposedly also supports shogi,
but it seems that nobody there knows how to play it (or are
just more interested in go than shogi...)
