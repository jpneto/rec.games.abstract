Ok, it's a nice day and I'm in a forgiving mood. It's clear that I'm
addressed here by implication, never mind the 'big ego' in the
clarification.

Why?
I'm a game inventor so I'm in desperate need of Harald Korneliussen's
coaching, that's why, lest I should go broke like Jim Albea or mental
like Steere.
But ... Harald Korneliussen "can guide me in a gentler direction: he
can - and has, many times - helped game inventors to get realistic
about their goals, and suggested things that have worked for others
when it comes to commercial success." Says Harald.

This was a year ago and imagine my surprise. First of all I'm probably
older than him and I had been inventing games since the early
eighties. In a material sence they had neither brought me anything nor
cost me anything, which was fine with me, and still is. I'm in it for
the challenge of creating/finding something in a clear abstract
environment that is limited and limitless at the same time. It's the
FUN of it Harald. I'll neither go broke nor mental over it, but thanks
for the warning.

In the Pit it says:
"You can't have a high summit without a broad base. As far as the work
of Christian Freeling goes these are games that came with the
territory. None of them are particularly important but most of them
will please at least some players."

Of course we offer the games, and progressively provide applets, for
free. Not only my games, but also traditionals and games by fellow
inventors.
This, to Harald, are clear signs of me having "inflated opinions of
myself and my games".

How about offering unsolicited advice in a paternalistic way and
getting nasty in fora when the offer is politely declined? Failure to
be recognized as the inventors' messiah?
