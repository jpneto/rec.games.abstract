Insead, if a captain, when not capturing, had to stop on a hexagon
where it can be captured (i.e. with an empty cell behind it or behind
the line of men it belongs to, if the oppossing piece is a captain,
and also adjacent to it, if it's a soldier), and stalemate were a
loss, then Pommel would be, needless to say, categorically drawless. I
guess the rule I've quoted doesn't mean that.

On the other hand, according to the same rule, captains must stop in
hexagons where they can "see" <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> oppossing piece, soldier or
captain. If that's so, many trivial draws are possible. Imagine a
position where each player has one captain on any square and one
soldier on a corner cell. Players could move their respective captains
always in line of sight of the oppossing soldier, but never actually
capturing it. Am I right?

This looks like an unnecessary restriction to me. Captains are already
very open to attack with the Mad Bishops rule. Why add another rule to
demote them further?

Meanwhile, linear capture makes for a very attacking game, doesn't it?
The games must be real slaughters (and great fun).

Hi Luigi

The captain capture is limited to the first empty square, no long
slide after the last captured piece.  Without this, and combined with
linear capture, I think captains would have been too deadly and the
game becomes a race to be the first to promote and then use the first
captain to decimate the opposition, a pattern I wanted to avoid.

You are correct about the existence of cooperative drawn positions,
and I realize now that I should have seen this (wipes egg off face).
I believed that one side would always be able force a win, but it is
also possible that neither player will see the forcing win and the
game will not terminate.  It also now occurs to me that there can be
positions, albeit rare, in which there is not a forced win.  I retract
my assessment of Pommel as a drawless game until such time as I revise
the rules (if I ever do so).  Christian, if you read this, please
correct the Mindsports description.

Thanks for your astute observations!
