250000 games of Arimaa played on the arimaa website

Oh get real.  The vast majority of those are barely started test games
against a bot.  The number of completed, person to person games is 
obviously a teensy weensy fraction of that.  Stop trying to mislead
everyone with Arimaa's phony popularity.

But the point is that there are two books on Arimaa, there are 
problem compendiums, there is collaborative analysis that occurs on 
the boards, or in game commentaries. Meanwhile, in Havannah, there 
are some cursory strategic notices from Christian Freeling,

Boy that's a lot of piss for someone who doesn't like pissing contests.  Arimaa is a good game by all accounts.   But it's also commercially produced and heavily promoted by Omar.  Arimaa's untold "success" is mainly a product of Omar's money, charisma, and dedication.  Arimaa uses proprietary equipment, and will only be produced for a limited time. Online, there are simply better games to choose from than Arimaa.  

SCROTUM HEAD DELETED THE LAST SENTENCE:

"When Omar dies, dig an extra hole for Arimaa."

WHAT A SHIT EATING OLD FOOL !!!!  LICK YOUR DIARRHEA CRUST OFF ED'S SAGGING BALLS, CHRISTIAN.  YUM YUM !!!!!
