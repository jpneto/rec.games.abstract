What if they both miss sozees?  



Interesting idea with the sozees but in practice it's too complicated.  And it's just a flippy game.  Weak.  Plus I don't like the four placements per turn.  It creates turn order advantage.



Overall I'm not impressed.  Sorry.

It`s too complicated???
It seems but in any game you will learn by yourself tricks such as detecting quickly the sozees.
It is like any game.
Do you want training?
Make a program for 7x7 board with random placement for 25 red stones and 24 blue stones.
The program will compute the sozees (of all kinds 2,3,4,5,6....) but will not reveal them to you.
Try to detect sozees and compare your performance to the results of the program.
I`m quite sure Mister NIL NIL will have a bad performance.
I can detect in less than 30 secondes all the sozees in 7x7 board.
