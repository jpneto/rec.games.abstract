I was pondering the levels of skill in games...

I dimly recall the Chess rating system: If player A is ranked 100 points
higher than player B, player A has a 75% chance of winning the game. Or
something like that.

Anyway, if we arbitrarily say that A and B have different levels of skill,
as defined by the above metric, we get to some interesting questions:

* What is the game with the highest # of levels of skill? Note that we
can even include things like wrestling, 1-1 basketball, or pool!

* Using the skill-level metric implied above - is the chess metric
zero-based? That is, would a player with a 1500 rating have a chance of
losing to a program that selected randomly among the legal moves
(.25)^15 of the time? This works out to about .000000000931 or roughly
one in 10^9

* Could two games be compared in this fashion to see which has the
higher levels of skill - and (this may be a leap) therefore which is
the deeper game? I don't think we can use the size of the game tree here;
for example, Hex has a huge game tree, much bigger than Chess, but
in a given situation almost all of the legal moves are poor, so that in
practice only a tiny bit of the game tree is explored, so I'd say that
Hex is a simpler game than Chess.
