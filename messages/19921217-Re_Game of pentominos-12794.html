a LONG time ago, i was given a game called "Pan-Kai".  this is a
variant of the above played with 2 sets of pentominoes in 2
colors on a 10x10 board.  the objective was still the same - make
the last move.  the difference was that now you could make a "box"
in the shape of a piece you still had but your opponent didnt.  this
would give you an extra move at the end.  i played that game quite
a bit as a kid and found it quite intriguing.  i never got to play
the 8x8 version because by the time i found out about it, nobody
wanted to have anything to do with me &amp; my pentominoes.  :-)  :-(

Oh, yeah? Very interesting. Back in the late sixties Parker Brothers came out
with "Universe," a pentomino game for 2-4 players. The rules were similar. For
2 players, the board is 10x10. In addition, there are four regions of
25 cells each appended to the 4 sides of the main square. The entire
board has 4-way rotational symmetry. For 3 players, use any two extra regions
in addition to the 10x10 grid. 4 players use the whole board. On your move, you
may not place a pentomino so as to "fence off" a region of &lt; 5 cells connected
horizontally and/or vertically. (Of course only the active portion of the board
is considered.) If you have no move, you're out of the game.
The last player to move wins.

Trivia: the game box contained publicity stills from "2001:A Space Odyssey."
One shot shows an astronaut playing Hal a game of something that looks like
Universe. Apparently that scene never made it to the movie. :)
