Here's the beauty of keeping these two objective criteria intact:
They knock out all designer games, all war games, all german games,
Carcasonne, Puerto Rico, Night of Dracula, and every game that has a
stack of shuffled action cards or character cards or whatever kinds of
cards there are.

Not quite.  Atlanteon by Knizia would still qualify (but then the
Euro gamers say it is just a theme pasted onto an abstract).

Antike and a few other games would sneak in too - no random or hidden
information at all.  However they are primarily multi-player games and
I know some would seek to eliminate them too (and I can see the
advantage if you are primarily interesting in tournaments).

If you contain the definition to being games that are playable with 2
players or two teams, then you can block Antike, right?  Atlanteon is
another issue, and I don't see why it can't be included in the
Commercial category.  It has been rethemed from the French Revolution
initial theme.

That still leaves games where there is randomness in setup but none
in play - for example Caylus or Through The Desert.  Do they qualify
or don't they?  I guess Caylus be fall by being too thematic but it
could be considered a perfect information game after setup; and if
setup was fixed for tournament play or by players choosing the order
of the six starting tiles in turn a perfect information game without
any reservations.  TTD is a more interesting case.  The theme is thin
enough that one might consider it, the play itself seems related to
other abstract games.  Fixed setups per tournament round could get
around the random setup issues.

I personally don't see the random set up of Through the Desert a
problem, because it is fair.  Caylus is a different animal completely
here as far as games go.  I think the nature of games part of IAGO
should involve the placing of pieces on a board that have a positional
impact on the game.  With Through the Desert that is so.  With Caylus,
it is not.  This needs to be a criterion.

Having a game free of a fixed set up results in a game which is deeper
and has more replayability, which is why I see Through the Desert as
acceptable here.

There is the fairness issue with variable set ups, like in Fischer's
Random Chess.  As a solution to that, I would argue that IAGO would
need to have players play both black and white.  In the case of
Through the Desert, a bidding system could be used if need be to see
who goes first.  Possibly the same idea of remembering the set up of
the pieces, and having everyone play every position and then comparing
scores.

Basically I would agree that the edges are too wibbly-wobbly to come up
with a reasonable definition that works in all cases.  I am not even
sure it is wise to even attempt it.

Well, something is needed to cover an association to promote such
games, and run tournaments with them.  Modern abstracts alone don't
usually build up a sufficient critical mass to sustain an association,
which is why I see there needs to be a home somewhere for them.  Also,
I would like to see multi-game events (Athlons) take place and some
association needs to oversee them.
