I'm not sure what I'll call it.  For now it's an experiment.
So here's how it goes.

a base 8 hex board
an exhaustive amount of stones white and black
....or reversi stones but there seems to be a bit of drama around the
origins of that game so I prefer Go stones ;)

On your turn:
Place 2 stones or Strike with a stone in play.

Place - 2 stones anywhere on the board not adjacent to your own color

Strike - Slide an already placed stone of your color X number of
spaces in a straight line to an empty cell directly adjacent to a
group of size X enemy stones.  Exchange all of this groups stones with
stones of your color.  A stone may not strike a group it's already
connected to.

The first player to create a size 10 group wins.

The strike is the mechanic which I find intriguing.  The rest is
filler.

I know that there are various readers of this forum who could possibly
give some suggestions or insights as to what might be wrong or right
with this experiment (Mark and Christian come to mind).  I don't think
it fits into Corey's design contest, although that's what got me
thinking about flipping mechanisms.  When I thought about what I
didn't like about flipping games, I wanted a mechanic that didn't feel
so random and unclear.  And flipping sucks.

Your very own stones turn into your horrible opponent's stones.
That's pretty dramatic to me. And a stone coming in from all the way
across the board to change your biggest group to it's color seemed
like a rather satisfying mechanic to show it.

If anyone tries it or has any insights I'd be delighted to see some.
