Thanks.  This is more or less where I was headed when I stopped short
with Basic.  I'm glad that happened though.  Comments from you and
Bill Taylor impacted my objectives in this project.  This game has
what I consider to be ideal gameplay, something I've long sought. Many
bidirectional games in the general arena of Riptide build up to a
crescendo, usually in the middle of the board, and then devolve into a
low energy, drawn out conclusion of the gameplay.  Not Riptide.  The
intermeshing of troops starts right away and keeps going for most of
the game.  Up until about the final 3% of moves, the game is still "in
play".  There's a massive recycling and intermeshing of opposing
checkers, and there's an extended battle all over the board, not just
in the middle.  Whatever Riptide is, it's not a game where you're
doing your thing on your side of the board, and I'm doing my thing on
my side of the board, more or less independent of one another.  That
kind of gameplay has a shrivelling effect on game trees.

Questions:

Thinking about the rule that only the player with the most checkers
showing gets to make omni-directional moves.  On the one hand, it
seems like a rich-get-richer mechanism, because the player who already
has the advantage of having the most checkers showing earns thereby
all the extra degrees of freedom imparted by the omnidirectional
moves, but at the same time, a reverse move takes a player farther
from his goal, so it's hard to gauge the value of reverse moves (a
fact I like).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The reverse move feature improves the quality of play from a technical
standpoint IMO because it virtually eliminate zugzwang, again, in my
subjective evaluation.  If you have backward move capability and your
opponent doesn't, you can back out of what was a bad zugzwang
situation for you.  Zugzwang hasn't really gone away here.  Quite the
opposite in fact.  Instead of the usual simple zugzwang found in
bidirectional games, you have one zugzwang mechanism being controlled
by another, seemingly independent, zugzwang mechanism - zugzwang
within zugzwang if you will.

This is the first game I've ever designed with the quality of the game
tree (i.e. the quality of gameplay) as the primary objective.  It
wasn't intended to be a "concept game" but it ended up being one
anyway.  You really have to dust off your checkerboard and try this
one.

 Do you find them to impart a strong advantage to the
player who can use them?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Reverse moves come in handy every now and then because of the zugzwang
relief I mentioned earlier and because sometimes your opponent gets
past you and you don't want to let him get away.  You have to move
backward to catch him and push him all the way across the board.  I
understand that moving backward sets you back, but there are occasions
when it's obviously the right thing to do.

What would the game be like if a player can only make omnidirectional
moves when she has <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fewer<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> checkers showing than her opponent?  If
having fewer checkers showing is a disadvantage, but having the right
to omnidirectional moves is an advantage, then this rule might lead to
a nice strategic trade-off between showing checkers and
omnidirectional moves.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's actually how the game was, starting out.  Two bad things about
that.  Say I drive one of your checkers into my far row (your near
row).  Then I bear that guy off.  Now I've reduced my showing checker
count by one while simultaneously increasing your showing checker
count by one, a potential polarity flipping event.  So, in this
earlier incarnation of the game, you were rewarded for bearing off a
checker by being granted backward movement capability (and taking away
your opponent's backward move capability at the same time). It's not
just that moving backward comes in handy sometimes.  It's also that
not being able to move backward is terribly inconvenient at other
times.

The other bad thing with the earlier incarnation was that there was a
tendency for players to pile their own checkers up in order to reduce
their showing checker count.  Again, players doing something
relatively independent of one another, shrivelling the tree.

Eventually I discovered a way to create an endless move cycle in the
earlier incarnation, and it wasn't a trivial matter to fix.  So I
switched over to the current (and final) incarnation, which I had been
thinking about doing anyway.  When I first play tested the new version
I was immediately impressed with the improved tendency to fan one's
checkers out in order to increase one's showing checker count, exactly
the opposite of what was happening before.  This fanning tendency is
so much better for gameplay.  Not that gameplay was awful before, but
it's distinctly improved now.  I eventually discovered a way to create
a move cycle in the (almost) current incarnation too, but by adding
the disallowed move type rule, I was able to clear up that particular
problem and finalize the game.
