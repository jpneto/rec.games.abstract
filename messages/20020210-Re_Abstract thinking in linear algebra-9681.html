We hear a lot that one of the reasons that education is in such a

I wasn't defending it, I was explaining it.  I forgot to add
&lt;/+sarcasm&gt;.  Although I wonder how much I (or you) would like to teach
an analysis class full of lazy bums.  (I don't consider wanting to
minimize work lazy.  That's smart.  I do consider refusing to do the
necessary work lazy.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I am not convinced that it is laziness in all, or
necessarily even in most, cases.  I believe that a
big problem is that they have been conditioned to 
memorization and routine computation, and that what
may well be needed is to almost get them to start
over.  I do not believe that the teachers who could
not learn the new math were that much weaker mentally
than the children who could, but that this brainwashing
had taken place, and they could no longer think of
integers and their properties without using as a basis
strings of digits and the manipulation rules.  

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
My (unofficial) undergraduate advisor thought that everyone should take
algebra as their first undergraduate course.  That way, the students
are starting over and don't stumble over their preconceived notions.
But maybe, as an algebraic number theorist, he had a higher regard for
algebra than analysis.  (Calculus, in his opinion, is for engineers,
not mathematicians.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is exactly what a friend told me when I mentioned
the above problem in teaching analysis.  I consider the
only reasonable alternative to have a GOOD course in
mathematical logic, but I would still follow it with
some abstract algebra, before linear algebra.

However, I disagree about the last statement.  Engineers
need to understand what the calculus concepts are, and how
to use them. In practical problems, they can use computers
to get answers.  It is far more important to know what a
differential equation means than to be able to solve one.

The ones who need to be able to do the calculus
manipulations are the theoreticians among the scientists
and engineers, and many mathematicians.  It is occasionally
even used in algebra.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And I doubt that abstract reasoning is inhibited by computation. 
Children (and adults too, for that matter) are pretty resilient. 
It takes lots and lots of bad teaching to undo our natural desires. 
And very, very lots to completely bury them.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This they have had.  It is at least 8 years for almost all,
and 12 or more for many.  Quite a few of the students in
the analysis course have had 14 or 15 years of it.

My siblings and I learned to read by "the whole word method" (also

I suspect you quickly developed phonic awareness.  Most who
learned this way not only did not, but became resistant to it.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The evidence (as explained to me:  I am not an expert on language
acquisition) is that "self-taught" readers overwhelmingly use the whole
word method.  You just read to the children a lot and suddenly they
read.  Frankly, speaking works the same way (in my experience).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is considerable evidence to the contrary.  The scientific
evidence is that children pick up grammar before much vocabulary,
by age 3, and some before age 1.  They are able to recognize 
regularities.

Self-taught readers also look for the regularities, thus using
some form of phonics quickly.  One learns the more used words
as whole words by using them, but learning by the whole word
method gives no basis on which to build.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
However, it isn't really a method.  As you say, it is a terrible way to
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>teach<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> reading.  Strangely, this is one of the few instances where
pedagogical orthodoxy followed research.  Studies showed that people
who learned to read by the "whole word method" were better readers than
those who learned by "the phonics method". 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

At the time it was introduced, this was not "known", and it has
never been established.  The books which came out in the 1950s
showed that.

What was observed was that the people who recognized more whole
words, and even larger units, read better.  I recognize 65536
as being 2^16, but never set out to "learn" this.  

It was even observed that good readers took in several words at
a glance, and the whole word method was the closest available.
This was confusing the I/O channel with the central processor.

	So "the educational
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
establishment" jumped to the conclusion that the method was better.
However, as I indicated above, the real reason was that self-taught
readers were "whole word" readers and also (and I don't believe
coincidentally) better readers. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, they use the large memorized set of words and syllables
when they are encountered.  They can be more easily thrown
off by slight deviations.  A whole word reader is completely
lost when a new word is encountered.

BTW, the increased literacy in China (also Taiwan) was
achieved by first teaching a phoneticization, which is
unrelated to their symbolic characters.  

In learning a foreign language, a grammar-based approach
is far more efficient.  We can use more of that in the
vernacular, but do the present teachers understand the
grammar of their own language well enough to do so?

	Now that we have adults who were
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
taught by the "whole word method" (what idiot came up with that phrase,
anyway?) we realize its shortcomings.

Maybe your experience differs from mine, but I have found very few
people who can't think abstractly.  Even after 13 or 17 or even 23

Read what I wrote.  After all these years, it has been
knocked out.  On the gifted mailing list, it has been
remarked that they almost insist on using the most
abstract approach they can.  We can teach variables, 
which are completely linguistic, NOT limited to numbers
or other mathematical objects, with beginning reading,
and build up.  Small children can understand the Peano
Postulates, and proofs.  It is after they think they
KNOW the mathematics of numbers that they rebel against
learning the underlying concepts.
