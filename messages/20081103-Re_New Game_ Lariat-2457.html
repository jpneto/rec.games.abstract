How is the closed end arranged?  Simplest would be to have
the "key point" connect to all the cells of the next row, like the
spokes
of an umbrella; this would be then an umbrella with
a big hexboard skirting.

This makes it essnetially a Hex game with one of the players
having side-to-side connected (cylindrical) borders, and
the other having regular Hexlike borders.  This doesn't sound
sufficiently different from Hex to be worthwhile; I daresay
that with different connections on the umbrellas part of it
the game could be made more funly different, but not greatly so.

That's why I think the (accicentally invented!) purely flat hexagonal
version is more different - enough to have a unique flavour of its
own!

OC it needs severe equalisation.
My plan of playing Unlur-style is one way,
and Nick's plan for having one player make all the initial moves is
another.

I think Nick's is game-theoretically superior, perhaps; but I think
mine is socially superior, as it doesn't require one player to do
ALL the initial work, but spreads it out evenly.

Nice to be part of an accidental-team game-construction gang!
