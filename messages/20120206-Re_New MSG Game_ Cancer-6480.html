Well, that's precisely why I don't like Dots'n'Boxes and its variants.
They're interesting from a mathematical point of view, and I can live
with that because they're as simple as a game can be, but making a
game with groups, liberties, eyes, territories, surrounding capture
and three-color stones behave like a merely parity game seems like a
waste to me. It's like using the Taj-Mahal as a doghouse.

I don't think so. As in Dots'n'Boxes, toy boards will only help make
the capricious outcomes more or less manageable, but Cancer should aim
higher than that.

On toy boards, Go isn't deep, but it <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> strategic.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yeah, I think you should consider that. The game would be far closer
to Go, sure, but at the same time cancer stones and simultaneous
captures would change many life and death situations, and figuring out
how non-cancerous Cancer differs from Go looks like much greater fun
than figuring out how cancerous Cancer differs from Dots'n'Boxes.
There are still some parity situations in the former, but they can
only occur if the game is completely even, which is not the case with
the latter.

I suggest Plasma (the portion of blood in which corpuscles and cells
are suspended). Red stones = red corpuscles, etc.

I second that.
