"You pick up your faithful M40A3 sniper rifle- the only thing you can
trust your life upon now- and head north. Approaching a ridgeline, you
RV with your spotter #2, who immediately signals you to your 2 o'clock.
Peering through your Swarovski LRS scope, you sight a figure 800 yards
away. Could he be bounty hunter CRAZY_JOE who currently carries a
US$2,000 tag for his head? Or is he just a spotter deployed by another
bounty hunter as a decoy to lure you into making the first shot, giving
away your position to him?

You start to ponder and calculate your risk, but soon you realize you
have pondered a moment too long. You hear a shot from your rear and the
next thing you know, your spotter #1 collapses onto the ground.
Instinctively, you swing your rifle around and locate the firer. You fix
your crosshair on his forehead and squeeze off. Unfortunately for him,
he made one mistake too many- the hunter became the hunted. His bounty
may not worth as much as CRAZY_JOE, but what-the-heck, that was easy
money. You cash out the US$10 into your pocket and move on."
