I went through all the knight moves, and so I understand how you move around on the board(s).  One thing you said is that if you move around in a little square you're still in the same big square.  I get that.  And if you move among big squares you're still in the same little square.  I don't get that.  I'm guessing that's the 4d aspect.  Two or more pieces can mysteriously occupy the same little square in 4D space.  How many pieces can occupy a little square like this?  16? 

This would be easier to understand with more diagrams. With arrows. And before and after diagrams (think Monkey Queen rule sheet).  It seems clear now in retrospect, but expecting people to struggle through an almost entirely textual description of a 4D game is a tall order. 

You gotta get someone to program this for online play.

Thanks for posting this, Mark. You surprised me! And thanks for the questions. They will help me clarify something I did not realize needed clarification, and I appreciate that. As for online play, the late Larry Lynn Smith put a version in zillions: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=show;id=1033">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi?do=show;id=1033</a> This version does not necessarily allow all the current rules, as it was made some years ago. Abdul-Rahman Sibahi made a 2-player version for play by email here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/play.php?game%3DJoe+Joyce+Hyperchess%26settings%3DJoe+Joyce+Hyperchess+">http://play.chessvariants.org/pbm/play.php?game%3DJoe+Joyce+Hyperchess%26settings%3DJoe+Joyce+Hyperchess+</a> I, sadly, am a dinosaur when it comes to modern computer/internet tech, so I may not be able to give more diagrams for the game. And not all the links on the various pages are active any more, nor can I fix them. :( For face-to-face play and to follow the example game given, there is a PDF for a printable board here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/hyperchess_board.pdf">http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/hyperchess_board.pdf</a> It is adequate.

The game, starting with the board, came from my problems with linear differential equations in college. I was unable to visualize 4 spatial dimensions, so I drew a small piece of 4D graph paper to help me understand 4D. It didn't help with the math, but it occurred to me that it would make a very interesting chess board. The board is a double grid piece of graph paper, 16x16 squares, representing 16 4x4 2D "tiles" laid out in a 4x4 pattern. This is the numbering system for both the "small squares" and the "big squares": 
                                                                                           | 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 |
                                                                                           | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 |
                                                                                           | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |
                                
           | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |

Each square of the board has a 4 digit position number, the first two numbers being the "big square", and the second two numbers being the "small square". So there are actually 16 small squares with the same 2-digit position number, 1 in each of the 16 "big squares". As in standard chess, only 1 piece/pawn may occupy any one "small" square. As a piece moves from one big square to the next, it always lands on the "same" (aka; corresponding) "little square" in the big square moved into. I hope that makes sense. I will try to talk someone into doing some diagrams for this, but...

It is highly laughable when a highly try to look smart.
What did you achieve by extending the chessgame to the fourth dimension (which is IN FACT not true)?
It is like trying to fit a circle in a square!!!!
There are rec.games.chess groups so go there not here.
