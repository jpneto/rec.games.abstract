Time to recycle some old material on this equalization stuff.

|&gt; The Japanese go-moku rules says:
|&gt; Black cannot play 3-3 4-4 or longly-connected,
|&gt; It is good to make balanced games, but there are some ambiguity:
|&gt; What if white play two 4's consecutively and FORCE black to play
|&gt; two 3's, one after the other?
|&gt; Does anyone know about the details. I am really annoyed.

Not surprised!  Actually the Japanese rules say a whole lot more than this,
too. There are rules about what the first 2 (or 3) moves may or may not be,
and who gets to choose them. It's all a frightful mess, very unnatural, and
spoils a perfectly good and natural "clean" game with wildly excessive
arbitrariness.

If you really want to play go-moku, I suggest playing the clean Western version,
that is, any point can be played on at any time, and 5 OR MORE in a line gives
a win, (not just exactly 5).  To counter the enormous (now known to be winning)
advantage to first-mover, I suggest you forget all those horrid Japanese
excrescences and use  THREE-MOVE EQUALIZATION,  of which I re-post below.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-----------------------------

There was a little discussion about 3-move equalization on
rec.games.abstract a little while ago.  The term is coined by me, and the idea
adapted by me from an (unnecessarily more complicated) method to equalize at
go-moku.   3-move equalization seems to be agreed to be an excellent method
for equalizing the winning chances, (in practice, not in principle), for
almost any abstract game; especially useful for those with an enormous
first-player advantage. These include chess, go, go-moku, hex, and many more.
It can also apply to games where the advantage to 1st or 2nd player is not
clear, such as reversi, sprouts, etc.

In every case it leaves the game unchanged for almost the whole of its course,
and adds a bit of extra thought at the start. For all these reasons it seems
an excellent procedure and ought to become standard for all these games.
-----------------------------

So:  EQUALIZATION:  To remove the first- (or second-) move advantage, while
                    leaving us playing essentially the same game.

My favorite method, which seems to work for almost all board games, is...

"3-move equalization"
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-
One player, the "Placer", plays a (legal) move for first-mover, then one for
second-mover, then another for first-mover. The other player, the "Chooser", 
then decides on the basis of the board state obtained, whether he wants to
be second-mover (and continue with the next move), or first-mover (and let his
opponent continue).

So the Placer is under some pressure to play three moves that leave "exactly"
equal chances, and the Chooser must try to find a flaw in this attempt. (The
question of who gets to be Chooser can be determined by lot; or in a match,
alternately).  This seems such a good method to me that I wonder it has never
been the rule in special tournaments. It would have the further advantage (e.g. 
in chess) that standard opening theory would not become quite so over-analysed.

For friendly games, one might object that, (just as in the cake-dividing
method of "you-cut-and-I'll-choose"), there is still a (psychological at least)
advantage to being the Chooser; but such is the fun of trying to find an
appropriate 3-move start, that I bet there would never be any lack of 
volunteers to be Placer.  And also, he could prepare some tricky traps, maybe !

----

Note that 3 seems to be the minimum number of moves that would lead to a
sensible equalization attempt, if it is to apply to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> board games. One can
see this by considering simplified go-moku, (5-in-a-row on an infinite board);
where clearly a 1-move or 2-move equalization attempt would be meaningless. 

However; for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, a 2-move or even 1-move equalization might be 
successful in equalizing the chances.  In particular, in both chess and go,
it is interesting to consider this.  Where would you play a first move, so
that your opponent could elect to be either 1st-mover or 2nd-mover, and you
would be equally happy with your chances either way ?

CHESS:  a3 ?    h3 ?   h4 ?   Na3 ?  (probably this last leaves white ahead).

GO:  3-2 ?   7-9 ?  2-2 ?  (This last one probably leaves black a little behind).

Anyway; whether or not 1-move equalization would work for chess and go, I'm
sure 3-move equalization would, and be a lot of fun too; <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>AND<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> leave the
game otherwise virtually unchanged.

 2-pass vs 3-pass rules give different results !  (smallest such board)

 2x4 go,  white to move...      . . . X      2-pass rule: X wins by  1
 Chinese scoring.               X X . .      3-pass rule: X wins by 12
