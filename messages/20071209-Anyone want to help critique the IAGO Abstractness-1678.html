The purpose of the IAR is to come up with a numeric rating for how
much a game deviates from a perfect abstract combinatorial game theory
game (perfect information, no luck, two players only, no theme).  If a
game gets a zero rating, then it would fit this category.  If you can,
please provide feedback.

Recently IAGO received a very strong venting complaint that it was
going WAY off track, and was going to "ruin" the definition of what an
abstract strategy game is.  There has been attempts to be able to have
standards and processes in place to prevent this, including the IAR.

But, I would be interested in combinatorial purists to review the IAR
to see if it is on-task.  Anyhow, for more information on the IAR,
please go here:

Feedback is welcomed and requested.  I will say that the idea of
number of pages the rules are isn't great, but short of a more
objective measure for a game being weak in theme, it is the only
objective measure found.
