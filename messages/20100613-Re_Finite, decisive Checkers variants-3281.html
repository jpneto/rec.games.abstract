I would say not opague, but concealing.  The game must be easy
to play and to understand how to play, at each level of expertise,
(so that second point goes to maintain clarity), but that nonetheless
a good player is beaten by a great player with the same
"WTF happened" feeling that occurs when he beats a poor player!

IMHO, Go and Dots&amp;Boxes are at the top end of this.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like clarity to include an ability to see which side has a clear
advantage even when part of the board is obsured. If you can only
know the state of the game by observing every single cell, you've
typically over-complicated it. I don't like it when almost any tiny 
change anywhere can quickly and dramatically affect things elsewhere.

Games like amazons have great clarity to me, for example for that
reason. A big area, or hemmed in amazon, is usually a dead give-away.
Games like LOA are the exact opposite - one far-off piece can change 
the mobility of many pieces, and the outcome of the game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
OTOH, some games admit many levels of expertise, but are
quite a bit opaque at almost every level.  IMHO Reversi is
the classic example of this.  I am now quite a good player of this,
but I still have no real idea of what I'm doing or why, even though
I beat lesser players with the same cavalier ease with which better
players beat me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

However, one thing I notice from reversi is that good players (and 
I'm lousy) manage to form particular arrangements or shapes. Given
a board position like that, even I can evaluate who's likely to win.

But in some ways, there is the butterfly's wings aspect too in 
reversi. A flip of a row may only be possible if another flip is
done prior to that, and the cascade of changes to the board can
mean that the board seems almost unrelated to its prior state after
only a handful of moves.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
When I lose at Go and D&amp;B, I know (after the event) exactly WHY
I lost; but after a Reversi loss I am completely in the dark!

IMHO, these anecdotes go a long way to describe how
the opacity/clarity dichotomy is more or less orthognal to
the depth/shallowness one.

In great part, but not entirely.   The winning method of
the poor player over the very poor one is QUITE clear to both!

 I think this is one way in which Go excels.
You start playing it, and you think, "ok, I know  what's going on!

Yes, very much so.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've been quite negative about go over the years - I don't like games
that rely on huge boards in order to inflate their search space, for
example - but since I've actually started to look at it a little more
(and, shock horror, started to play a few games against fellow newbs),
I've realised that there is indeed a great disconnect between thinking
you know what is going on, and actually knowing what's going on. The
rules are clear, I do know what's going on - but yet I keep getting
taken by surprise. I have a lot more respect for the game now.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Another point may apply here.  If the game is clear, but deep,
it is still possible for the better player to TEACH the lesser one,
out-of-game, by verbal help or by books.  This is very much
the case at Go, at every level.

But I have found it to be very much NOT the case at Reversi.
Apart from the very vague "try to stay internal and keep
the opponent on the outside", there is little I can ever teach
a poorer player, or learn from a better one. It is VERY frustrating!

The existence of very extensive and indispensable "opening books"
is another strongly significant piece of evidence for opacity at many
levels.

I've never liked opening books, or games that rely on them, and you
may have uncovered the reason why.
