Anyway, to begin, has anybody started working towards a theory for the
old AH game TWIXT?  I haven't been able to work on it because I suck at
playing against myself with any kind of honesty, and I seem to be able
to crush anybody else I play against by just starting off with this
simple strategy and then playing reasonably until I win:

[vague description of strategy]

So, does anybody already know if this is a first- or second-player win?
If not, how about some more data on how the game progresses during an
even match?

Also, I'm not going to attempt to describe this game called HexMeister,
but I would like to hear from anyone who has heard of it and played it
and found a way for the second player to be in any position other than
totally hosed from the beginning of the game.  Thanks.

OK. You haven't stated the rules of Twixt, so I'm going to have to
guess. Play alternates, and a turn consists of placing one of your
pieces on an empty square. You win if you get a chain of your pieces
between the opposite sides of the square board that have been designated
as yours. Pieces that are diagonally adjacent are considered to be next
to each other when we define "chain". Is that right?

In that case, the game cannot end in a draw because if one player never 
gets a chain between his sides of the board then the other player must 
have a chain between his.

It now follows that the game is a first-player win, because one or other
player must have a winning strategy, and if it were the second player the
first player could play his first move at random and then play the second
player's winning strategy with an extra piece.

If I was wrong about the connectivity (if diagonals don't count, say) then
it might be possible to get a draw (say, if the players place pieecs in a
checkerboard pattern).

If HexMeister is a game like the above but played on a board of hexagons,
then again the game cannot end in a draw, and again it is therefore a win
for the first player.

None of this gives much help in finding a winning strategy, unfortunately.
