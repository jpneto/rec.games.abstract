|You can play hex online against other humans at any of the
|following three sites.

|The last site hasn't been advertised yet because it is still under
|development.  Consequently, the site is usually empty.  It does
|have more options as far as board size is concerned and the board
|looks nicer than the other two sites.  Once the site gets finished
|and advertised, hopefully people will start playing there.  Also,
|the site is supposed to eventually have Twixt. To my knowledge,
|there are as of yet no places to play twixt online (other than email).

There is now! The Virtual Games Club is at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/virtualgameclub">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/virtualgameclub</a>

It's a place for gamers to play a wide variety of games available
nowhere else. The way it works is, first you download the core sw
available at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/~vgc/">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/~vgc/</a>
Then you download script packages for whatever games you're interested
in. WARNING! The Twixt package at the boardgamegeek site is NOT
the latest version. The latest version is at the VGC site. You
have to be registered with Yahoo (it's free). Then when you sign in
at the vgc site, the column on the left becomes active.
Click on "Files" and scroll down to Twixt.zip
Download the file and extract it to the same directory that has
the Vgc.exe file. It will create a /Twixt subdirectory of images.

You can test the software out on your own, if you like.
You need to invoke two copies of the VGC program.
HOST on one and JOIN on the other. You should be online for this.
In the host window, click on Manage-&gt;Players and select the 2nd
copy of yourself as player 2.
Then click on File-&gt;New Game and select Twixt.vgb (or whatever
variant of Twixt you want to play). The board should appear in
both windows.

It's crude, but it works. Improvements will be added with time.
Unfortunately, the server it's running on is not very reliable.
I tried to hook up with a German friend to play, but we were
unable to connect. We wound up using Kevin Walker's excellent
JTwixt program instead, and relayed coordinates back and forth.
Kevin's program doesn't play the game, but it serves well as an
electronic board. It even does link addition automatically
(which can be overridden if desired.) It's a free download at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.xmission.com/~kwalker/jgame/README_twixt.html">http://www.xmission.com/~kwalker/jgame/README_twixt.html</a>

Eventually, perhaps Jtwixt will have direct TCP/IP client/server
functionality...

Anyway, if anyone would like to play Twixt on the VGC, please
drop me a line! I have added row handicapping as an option, so
newcomers could still have a good chance to beat me :-)
