You're right, but again, this wasn't really the point.

His point was that even though the English form of checkers is a
popular game, and so sets are readily available in the United States,
it isn't popular <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>enough<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> so that sets which conform to the official
recommended form are available. You can - in games specialty stores -
manage to find chess sets that qualify for UCSF tournament standards,
but that's partly because their standards for the boards, at least,
are less restrictive.

And so this was part of a complaint about the variety of game
equipment available: not only are 10 by 10 boards for Continental
Checkers not available, even a "proper" board for regular checkers is
not. (But I found a "Bucket of Games" chess set with red and yellow
pieces from Pressman in a dollar store lately, so now I have real
pieces for four-player chess!)

Now, I remember that a few years ago, a Canadian firm - AMAV might
have been its name - produced a "500 Game" set where several 8 1/2"
pieces of cardboard included boards for a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of traditional games,
even The Game of Goose; it was very inexpensively made, but it was an
attempt to 'top' the other multi-game sets on the market. So if one's
standards of real equipment are generous enough, it was tried...
