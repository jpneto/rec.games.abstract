I was talking about John Forbes Nash, not about Piet Hein:

Hein invented it a couple of years earlier, but JFN invented it
independently, supporting your view that it would indeed have been
invented anyway, at some point in time. I agree with that.

That however steers away from the basic point that you'd "rather be
without games from cranks", apart from the implication that you'd
therefore rather deny others such games. That's typical of a
totalitarian mind.

Hitler and van Gogh were both painters. Hitler would indeed have
denied others to appreciate van Gogh's work, work of a crank who cut
his ear off. You would have agreed with him no doubt.

Now here's one for you to to nitpick about: "He's comparing himself to
van Gogh!" or: "He's comparing me to Hitler!".

No on both accounts, so don't bother.
