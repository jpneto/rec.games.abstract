CONCLUSIONS 

On average, my Cephalopod is played more than twice as often as Christian Freeling's Havannah!

Popularity is not about butt smootching.  If it were, Christian's games would tower above mine.  It's simply about quality.  

What brought all this about?  Raph, a talented player at Game Site X, lost at Hex Oust twice in a row to Corey Clark.  I poked a little fun at Raph and he had a complete meltdown, ranting that I need to smootch butts, including his, and cultivate an audience for my games.  When I balked at that, the sore loser vowed to boycott all of my games indefinitely.  This will wreak devastation, Raph assured me, since now he won't write any strategy guides for me.  ????  He didn't do shit before now!

All the butt smootching in the world won't advance your games one iota.  Either they're good or they aren't.  I'm not implying Havannah is a bad game.  In fact it's probably Christian's best.  It's just not as fun to play as Cephalopod.
