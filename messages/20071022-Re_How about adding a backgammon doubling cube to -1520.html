Storm Over Arnhem (Avalon Hill) had something strategically similar
(in a way) called the initiative chit.  Whoever held it could call for
a re-roll of the dice at any time...but then the chit was handed to
the other player.  So it was constantly trying to decide which was
more important, the reroll or denying it to your opponent.

The version of this in GMT's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Twilight Struggle<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is "The China Card",
a card that lets you perform an action at the most effective level,
but which you must then give to your opponent. It is worth a victory
point at the end of the game, and also if you possess it when certain
other cards are played (most appropriately, the "Nixon Plays The China
Card" card).
