I wouldn't say the pocket knight was added "all for the wrong reasons," but
I can only guess at the motivation.  Yes, the pocket knight seems arbitrary
to me, but Chess is already a study in arbitrariness.  One more arbitrary
rule doesn't ruin Chess.  The linked article mentions that Pocket Knight is
especially popular among children.  I believe the extra knight is a
wild-card element added to make the game a little less serious and a little
more fun for the right audience.

Cyclix's way to achieve that is rooted in the 'recycle'
process. Again it has a set of pieces that is _as unarbitrary
as possible_!

Cyclix is still plenty arbitrary.  Even Monkey Queen, which is minimally
based on a finite mechanism, can't escape the arbitrariness that all Chess
variants are subject to.

Not entirely  :)

The only new feature [in Cyclix] is that it is the first Atlantis

It appears I've been transformed from the hunter into the hunted  :D
