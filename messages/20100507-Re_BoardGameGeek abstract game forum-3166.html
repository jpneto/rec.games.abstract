Answering the question "What has Mark Steere ever done for abstract
strategy games" is easy.  He has invented some of the most
intellectually rigorous and interesting new abstract games and made
the rules freely available.  The answer is so obvious that the
question is idiotic and clearly motivated only by your current state
of peeve.

I also support, in principle, an organization like IAGO, but I am
uneasy with Richard Hutnik's attempt to subsume all existing chess
variants into something he calls "IAGO Chess."  Seems intellectually
dishonest to me, the act of someone who wants to possess rather than
to promote.  I hope that his desire to define and classify everything
doesn't mean that this is where he wants to go with abstact games also.
