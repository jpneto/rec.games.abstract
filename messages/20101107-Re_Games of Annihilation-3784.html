You know what your problem is Clark, in all seriousness?  And no, not
aspergers.  Nobody believes that shit.  You only care about the fame, not
the game.  You've demonstrated a pattern.

"Four people liked my game!"

I've lost track of how many people have told me they like Atoll more than
Hex.

"Arty programmed my game!  I didn't even recommend it to him!  Someone else
did!"

Stfu already.  Get some self respect.  Your groveling is making me sick! 
That's why I left bgg.  I couldn't stomach the sight of Mistress Octavia
trying to stretch her two sizes too small, neon pink, spandex miniskirt over
one grapefruit sized nut sack, one kielbasa sized cock, and Korneliussen's
head (kielbasa in throat to save space).
