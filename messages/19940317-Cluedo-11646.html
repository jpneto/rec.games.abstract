Hi all,

Does anybody know if a strategy for the game Cluedo was ever implemented for
computers, or if (and where) the game was discussed as far as an optimal
strategy is concerned?

As I don't know if the game is called the same everywhere, I give a (simplified)
explanation of the rules. Object of the game is to find out three pieces
of information (it can be generalized of course), each of which can be one
of a limited setof possibility - in the original game it is the murderer (6
possible people), the object with which the victim was killed (6 possible
objects), and the room in which it happened (9 possible rooms). For each of
those 21 possibilities there exists one card. At the start, one card of each
kind is taken out of the game and hidden from all players. The remaining 18
cards are given to the players (secretly of course). So each player knows
some negative information, namely cards that are not in the envelope. In turn,
each player must 'ask' a person, an object and a room (he's free in the
selection - here I simplify the rules a bit). After having made such a
question, the player after him eitehr has one of the three cards or not. If
he has one, he has to show it to the asking player (covered) - if he has several,
he's free in which card to show. The asking player of course then knows that
the otehr player has this card. The remaining players only know that he has
one of the three asked cards, but not which one. If the player has none of
the cards, he states so (and everybody knows it then), and the next player in
turn has to show to the asker a card or state he has none - this goes on, until
either one player did show a card to the asker, or all players (except the asker)
stated they had none of the three cards. Then, the next player in turns becomes
the asker. If a player knows the solution (and it's his turn to ask), he solves
the question and wins.

Object of all your questions of course is to maximize the information you get,
and to minimize the question the others get. And if you have to show a card and have
several possibilities, you try to show the one that gives the least information.
One task is bookkeeping - for example if player A asked 1-7-20 and player B shows
him a card, you know B has 1, 7 or 20. If later on you get to know that player
C has card 1, you can now constrain the possibilities for B to 7-20. If, later on,
player B says to a question of 2-8-20 that he has none, then you know he hasn't
20 and deduce that he must have 7 (by negative information). Also, you know how many
cards each player has and can so also constrain some possibilities. But with
all your questions you must be careful that others don't gain too much information
(which is difficult to do as you don't know how much they have).

I wonder if something like an "optimal strategy" was ever developped for this game.
Of coursde heuristice are a possibility.. any ideas?
