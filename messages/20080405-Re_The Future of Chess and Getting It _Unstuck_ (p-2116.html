This thread has about come to the point where someone calls for Hikaru
no Abstract.

Having encountered a mention of Hikaru no Go in my searches for
information on Go, I then heard a friend who was learning Japanese
note that he had seen that anime in Shonen Jump. I saw a few issues at
a local secondhand bookstore, but glancing through them, I was not
impressed; too many of the plots depended on people actually cheating
at Go, which I suspect is just as rare as cheating at Chess in direct
over-the-board play - that is, virtually nonexistent. (Cheating by
computer consultation, on the other hand, is a big problem, but that's
quite different from moving stones or knocking down one's opponent's
hand...)

So, you are saying if it is shown that a player is channeling the
spirit of Bobby Fischer, they should be banned from a chess
tournament? :-)  Or, were you saying that the main character went
against cheaters?

By the way, when I was running a game tournament at a local
convention, someone in a wheel chair who depended on his brother's
help, to actually play.  He told his brother the moves, and his
brother played.  Would this be acceptable?  As for Hikaru No Go, it
has resulted in a worldwide interest in Go.  It has done what Fischer
did with Chess, but doesn't rest on the stability of a single person
to be able to sustain it.
