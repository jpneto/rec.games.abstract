...  There is a sense in which Y includes Hex.
After the first few moves in a game of Y, you can end up with a position
such that the remainder of the game is exactly a game of Hex.  So, the
Hex decision tree is embedded in the Y decision tree, as a subgame under
certain circumstances.  I wish I had a link to picture of this
situation, but I don't.  According to the set-theoretic definition of
"generalization", Y can be considered a generalization of Hex.  Whether
it's an interesting generalization is up for debate.

Here is a simple image which shows what I believe you are talking about.
A size 13 triangular Y board becomes a 7x7 Hex game after some horrible 
moves by each side.

This text graphics image requires a fixed width font:


    B   B   B   B   B   B
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
    W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
      W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
        W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
          W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Not all of the triangular board is shown. B indicates moves by black and 
W indicates moves by white.

Technically, this is NOT a 7x7 Hex game, for two reasons.

The most important reason is, all experienced Hex players and all the Hex 
servers on the Net use the swap rule. After the very first stone is 
placed on the board the second player has the option at that moment only 
to swap sides. This makes the game much more balanced and interesting. 
But here, after 6  moves by each side, swapping sides in Y is forbidden.

A non-issue, surely? If you trust your opponent to build the borders 
before starting the alternative game, then you should trust your 
opponent to play the first move of the alternative game, and offer 
you a swap, before the artificial borders are constructed.

amazed, it was awesome, recognised every word I said. Then I said the 
wrong word ... and it typed the right one. It was actually just
