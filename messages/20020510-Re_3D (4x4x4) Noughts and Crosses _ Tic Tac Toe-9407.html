Of course, the second player can't win. As usual this is proved with a
strategy stealing argument.

There are several programs out there that play this game perfectly.
Programming is probably not very easy, and you are advised to do it in
a more appropriate language such as C++ or Visual Basic or Java.
You might do better to ask rec.games.abstract about this.

Here are some crude guidelines:

The first move should be in one of the 8 corner cells, or one of the 8
central cells. SUbsequent moves should probably be in the same
"region" as the first move, during the opening phase. If you are
interested in a more fair variant, restrict the first move to any
cell OTHER than these 16 cells.

Three tokens of one color in any planar 4x4 cross section, without
any opposing tokens in that cross section, is usually a threat to
win. (cross sections can be diagonal as well as orthagonal.)

SOme winning sequences can be 25 ply or maybe more. But this may be
manageable, since the opponent's reply is forced each time, and the
only subsequent moves you consider are continuing threats. You need
to watch out for forced replies that themselves make 3 in a row;
if the block to that "returns the volley" by making a 3 threat in
return, then that branch might still work.
