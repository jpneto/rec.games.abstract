Dear sir,

Thanks you very much for your answer, you gave me very interesting tricks.

I have just a question about this part :

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
     2. For positions with N empty spaces (starting with N=1 and
        moving up), let value be determined by the values of positions
        reachable in one move (by placing a piece in one empty space).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

When you say to place a piece in one empty space, you mean to try all
the possibilities with the current color and do an average of them ?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

More or less, but maybe the average is not the best possibility.

Assume that, when you evaluate a position, it is the opponent's turn
to move next.  So it makes sense to take the value of the opponents
best move as the value of the position.  So, for all empty squares
that the opponent can fill, find the resulting position after the move
and look up its value in the table, and then take the value that is
best for the opponent as the value of the position.

There are a few complications:

 1. Since you don't have the full board (but only two rows), you don't
    know exactly which empty spaces the opponent can move in.

 2. For the same reason, you don't know exactly which pieces to flip
    when a move is made.

So you must approximate in both cases.

A reasonable approximation for the first point is that the opponent
can place in an empty square in the edge row if you have a
neighbouring piece in the near-edge row and that the opponent can
always place in any empty near-edge space.

For the second point, you can get exact results for lines parallel to
the edge (as you have full information for these), so it is only for
the three lines that go away from the edge that you need to
approximate. For near-edge spaces, these are entirely outside the area
you investigate, so you need no approximation.  For edge spaces, you
can make the approximation that, if there is one of your pieces on the
near-edge row on the line in question, then the opponent will flip
that.  Or you can try both possibilities (flip or no flip) and take
the average value of the resulting positions.
