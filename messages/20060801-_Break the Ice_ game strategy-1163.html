<br>&nbsp; I'm trying, just for fun, to make a computer player for an abstract
<br>game similar to Milton Bradley's "Dont Break the Ice"

<br>
<br>minus the chance and physical-skill elements. Source code and a 
DOS/Windows executable available here for anyone who wants them:

<br>The game is played on a grid of cells, with each cell initially filled
<br>with an "ice block." Each player, on his turn, "knocks out" one of the
<br>blocks; if this causes any other blocks to be unsupported, they also
<br>fall. The player who causes the last block to fall is the loser.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Example game:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 123
<br>
<br>&nbsp; a OOO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice starts by knocking out B2, the central block.
<br>&nbsp; b OOO
<br>&nbsp; c OOO
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OOO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob knocks out A3,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; causing A2 and B3 to fall, as they're no longer
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OOO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supported by an "arch" of connected blocks.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice knocks out C2, causing C3 to fall.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O..
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OOO
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob is forced to knock out one of the blocks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the remaining arch, causing all three to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall; he loses the game.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; My questions for the rec.games.abstract folks: Has this game been
<br>analyzed before? Is there any known strategy that applies to many
<br>different kinds of boards ("go for the corners first," or something
<br>like that?)
<br>
<br>&nbsp; My question for the comp.programming folks: I quickly determined
<br>that the standard alpha-beta pruning technique doesn't help with
<br>this game, because I don't know any way to evaluate the "strength"
<br>of a position except as a win or loss. So most of the branches in
<br>an alpha-beta tree of any reasonable depth (i.e., not deep enough
<br>to see all possible endings) end up with a value of zero, which means
<br>the computer is moving randomly most of the time.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Yet there are some positions, such as (I think)
<br>
<br>&nbsp; ....OO
<br>&nbsp; ....OO
<br>&nbsp; ....OO
<br>&nbsp; ....OO
<br>&nbsp; OOOOOO
<br>&nbsp; OOOOOO
<br>
<br>which a human player can tell are a win for the moving player, without
<br>having to explicitly examine the whole tree --- we can collapse certain
<br>"families" of moves into single cases, for example. How do we get the
<br>computer to do the same thing?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Is there any way to get the computer to play smarter, other than
<br>adding more and more special cases to the position-evaluation code?
