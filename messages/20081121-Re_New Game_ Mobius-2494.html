Also the quicker one is to post claims of error!   ;-)

Ok, ok, I don't want to have a big flame war with you about it.

As I explained to you by email, which you seem to have accepted,
it was NOT flawed, but a superior variant, having the simpler

I thought you were kidding with that email, since you used the winky
face ";-)"  I didn't see the point you were making at the time but now
I have gone back and reviewed it and I see your point.

Here's a list of my accomplishments in the last <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>month<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  I discovered
Lariat, which together with Hex and Y forms a trio of the three
simplest wlc connection games in existence.  I designed Super Lariat
which is the only closed surface, wlc, equal goals games in existence
- with no plastic bridges or other Crossway type gimmicks.  I
discovered the first ever wlc game for the mobius strip, a variant of
which you have made.  I was the first to apply the Hex and Y
principles to multi-edge 3D surfaces.

Does anyone have a fucking problem with all this?  How about a little
respect?  All I get in response is some bitch, nitpicky complaint
about the name I chose for M-Torus, which unknown to me at the time
was a variant of Bill's Projex.  What a bunch of faggots.
