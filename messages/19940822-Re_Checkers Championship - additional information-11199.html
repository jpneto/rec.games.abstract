   Ridiculous? then instead of posting irrelevant trivia, why don't
you address the issue that was raised.  Jonathan Schaeffer admitted that
the title had not been legitimately won.  Is it not poor sportsmanship
to accept a title that has not been legitimately won?  If not, why not?

Mr. Fong, you are not a very careful reader.  We won the title LEGITIMATELY
according to the rules of the match.  The fact that we do not like how this
happened is irrelevent.

and I am appalled by the utter lack of class shown by
some posters on this topic.  A public apology is called for, but it
appears that some people are too small to admit when they are wrong.

Unfortunately, there are some people who will argue their point forever
and never admit they were wrong.  My experience is that they always must
have the last word.  Kindly make one last post (your last word on the
subject) and then move on to other (presumably) more important things
in your life.
Thank you.
