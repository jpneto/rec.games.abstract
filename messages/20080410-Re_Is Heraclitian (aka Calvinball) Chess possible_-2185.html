I kept the original set of versions of Random Variant Chess, and the
10 by 8 version I added at the last, but I've replaced the other
recently added versions (Historical Random Variant Chess and Mutable
Random Variant Chess) by something which has included their best
features, but made more organized and rationalized, which I call
Progressive Random Variant Chess (the Progressive part has to do with
the placement of the Camel and the Giraffe on the board if they are
used) and which offers more possibilities - up to 172,620 possible
variants of Chess on the 12 by 8 board.

Perhaps this might be Heraclitean enough...

I have now added notes to my page on Spectral Realm Chess to cover how
the various Fairy Pieces in Random Variant Chess would be modified in
respect of the possibility of half-step diagonal moves, and I have
added a page on what I call "Half-Shogi Chess" to reduce draws, with
inspiration from Shogi, but without having full unrestricted drops in
the manner of Shogi, which has already been proposed (Neo-C from 3M/
Mad Mate/Chessgi) by others.
