Arty Sandler's meltdown in the iggc game chat, 10/2/2012:

####################
MarkSteere: Try to show a little appreciation for us "annoying designers" (paraphrasing). What would you have without us? Italian Checkers, Backgammon, Toguz, Talpa.  A little respect goes a long way.

Arty: Talpa is a finite drawless game (something that you adore so much) with simple rules. It has strategy, tactics, drama and learning curve.  But, you know what.. I don't really care about your opinion since what you do is not ethical in the first place.

"He adds his own not-so-good-games on his own site instead of adding my good games". What a bullshit.

Zotmeisterz: Cephalo Man is laughing at you all. You're not going to stand for that, are you?

MarkSteere: "bullshit"? This after correcting everyone on their language in defense of all the little 12 year olds reading this? I said Talpa was "not a bad game". Why is is that so insulting? 

You have helped designers with iggc. I and others have acknowledged that many times. Conversely, you don't seem to acknowledge that iggc has benefited greatly from our contributions. Yes, contributions. Do you acknowledge that or not? 

Instead of lording over and threatening designers, why don't you show some appreciation, Arty? Your emphasis is how you're doing us all a favor, which you are. But you've benefited from us too. It's a 2 way street.

Iggc wouldn't be nearly as good if it only had checkers variants, Toguz, and your games. That's my point. Not that Talpa is inferior.

Arty: Mark, threatening designerS? Any justification for that "s" at the end?  You keep bringing fights in here despite of numerous requests to stop doing so.

christianF: As far as I'm concerned there's no justification for the "s".

Arty: Besides, what benefit exactly have I got? Had fun creating games?

MarkSteere: Who's fighting other than you? Iggc is a better site because of contributions from me, Corey, Christian, etc. You can't admit that, can you.  Why is that so hard for you to admit, Arty?

Arty: Mark, just stop, ok? You're crossing the line here.

MarkSteere: <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>You're<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> crossing the line! It's your site, so I'm crossing the line and you're not?  

Arty: Wonderful. You're free to ask me to remove all your games and leave the site where the owner crosses the line. Just say one word. And I'll do it in the next 15 minutes.

MarkSteere: I'm asking you to acknowledge that iggc is a better site for our contributions. How is that crossing the line?

Arty: And we both will have our own ways but separately.

MarkSteere: Fuck you. What a baby.

Arty: Woah. Leave the site, Mark.  Until furher notice Mark Steere games are disabled on this site. However, the archive of already played games is preserved as a matter of courtesy to the players.

Zotmeister: You missed Cephalopod, Arty.

Arty: Thanks, disabled as well.

Arty, why is it so hard for you to admit that iggc is a better site for the contributions of modern designers?  Talpa, as I've said, is not a bad game..  But it's not as good as my Oust, Christian Freeling's Havannah, Corey Clark's Slither, etc. etc. etc.

Is this an ego thing?  I'm genuinely perplexed at your stubborn non-acknowledgement of the talent of modern designers.  Do you have to be the best at everything, including game design?  If that's the case, you need to grow up and admit that other people are better than you at their own specialties. I hope I'm wrong, but if this is an ego problem, that's a real handicap in life.  You need to get a handle on that.

As far as deleting my games, that was totally childish. If you don't want me on your site, you can ask me to leave, which I'll be happy to comply with..  Cutting off your nose to spite your face by throwing away work you've invested and depriving members of games they enjoy is utterly infantile.

I ask you for like the tenth time, Arty.  Do you acknowledge that iggc is a better site for the contributions of modern designers?  Yes or no?

Is iggc just a vehicle for you to lord over designers to compensate for your feelings of inferiority to them?  And yes, it's designerS with an S.  At one point in your temper tantrum, you threatened not to add any more modern games.  And you've <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> expressed appreciation for designerS, with an S..

Christian, get your face out of Arty's ass for five minutes.  You're a world famous designer.  Get some self respect and stop grovelling before anyone who will program your games.
