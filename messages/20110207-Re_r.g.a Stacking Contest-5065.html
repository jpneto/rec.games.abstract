Who gives a shit?  I don't.  It's not like we're so inundated with entries

weeks into the contest. [shaking head, rolling eyeballs, etc.]

Dude, I'm not directing this at you, but I'm fucking tired of hearing about
games possibly not qualifying for some mysterious, arbitrary stacking games
definition, which there's never any attempt to reveal.  Make no mistake, I'm
not asking for a definition.  I don't even want to hear some bullshit
stacking game definition where stacking meets some bullshit arbitrary
standard of being integral to the game.  A stacking game is one which is
conveniently played by stacking shit on other shit.  So says me.

Exactly.  Again, not directing this specifically at you Daniel, but why keep
bringing it up endlessly if it was ruled out as an issue from the get go? 
Christian said anything up to and including Checkers variants.  But now
suddenly Monkey Queen is borderline not qualifying because it doesn't meet
some bullshit, arbitrary, never-once-specified-but-endlessly-referenced
standard.  It's fucking asinine.

VOTING:

1.  You are not required to submit a game to vote.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

OH FUCK THAT!  My understanding was a game submission earned you a vote.  I
did a lot of groundwork before the contest clearing out ass weeds like Bill
Taylor and Harald Korneliussen, etc.  The contest wouldn't even have been
possible without that.  Now they and their sockpuppets are going to come
back and vote on my game?  I don't think so.  Count Monkey Queen the fuck
out if that's how it's going to be.

I'm also calling for transparent voting.  I don't want to get a D+ for
Monkey Queen and hear a lot of kiss-ass "Oh I gave Monkey Queen an A, Mark!
Everyone else gave it an F!"  If this turns into a testicularly challenged
event, I'm withdrawing Monkey Queen.

I like it.

Hate it.  This seems like more ass kissing fodder.  "Oh I dutifully played
every game so now my vote is worth a lot more than everyone else's."  Fuck
that.  How are you going to ensure that someone played the game, or that
they weren't just mindlessly making moves if they did play the game?  I had
a guy tell me after playing me in Jostle that all of his moves had simply
been the first move on the drop down list.  How much extra credit do you get
for that?

Let's just use the honor system and evaluate the games to our satisfaction.
We can discuss them one by one in the forum and play them amongst ourselves
when they're programmed.  That's another thing that requires time. 
Programming.  Playing.  Turn based playing.  Not everyone has a free hour to
test every game.  There's going to be a lot of turn based play, which can
take weeks.

DEADLINES:
Is it 9th of February or March 20th?

I like Nate's suggestion of a yearly competition which
starts at winter solstice and ends at the spring equinox.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like the winter for the design period.  Given three months, I feel fairly
confident I can come up with a game, test it out, modify it etc.  I think
the evaluation period should come after, not be carved out of the three
months.  And the evaluation period needs to be more than three weeks I
think.  That's a lot of programming and turn based playing to shove into
three weeks.
