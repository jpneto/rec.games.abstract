Hi, all. I'm a new member and one of my design interests is war chess, a fusion of chess variant and wargame. I've come up with a decent design that I'm calling Command and Maneuver which needs a few more scenarios. It's a structured multimove abstract strategy wargame construction kit, and the best playtested scenario is The Battle of Macysburg, a riff on the battle of Gettysburg. There is an introductory scenario called A Tale of Two Countries which gives one a basic idea of how the games work, but it doesn't fly like Macysburg does. I've started working on a large version of Tale, a campaign game, but it needs playtesters. These games are a little outside the norm for abstracts and somewhat high end. Since I'm brand new here, I don't know what sort of organization you have for running playtests or game development. I will offer reciprocal playtesting. The games are available as print and play, and also on VASSAL. Now, how do I snag peoples' interest?

Hi and welcome here,

Let us assume that the game if playtested will go well.
What this game if played add to the chessgame?
Will it change the playgame? 
Will it make this variant more addictive more replayable?
Any variant of any known game needs to add something new to the playgame unless it will fail.
Thank you for any answer.

What this set of game rules adds to chess - 
1) Activators, pieces that allow other pieces to perform actions which they could not without the presence of activators.
2) Multiple moves per turn. In Macysburg, for example, about midgame, there can be around 100 pieces on the board, all of which may be capable of moving each turn.
3) Differential squares. In modern chess there are white squares and black squares. Macysburg uses 4 colors of squares, white, brown, green, and gray. Just as bishops are excluded from the wrong color squares, the brown and green squares exclude different types of pieces. The gray squares are generally goal squares, and affect winning conditions. 
4) Different set-ups for each individual scenario. The 3 colored squares, green, brown, and gray, are individually placed on the board for each game, allowing a different board for each play of a specific scenario. The board itself is variable in size. 
5) Variable winning conditions. The games use multiple activators which take the place of the kings. Generally it is easier to win by achieving geographic objectives rather than eliminating so many of the opponent's activators that the opposing army is unable to move or to move effectively.
6) Replacements and reinforcements coming on board at various times during a game.

What this set of game rules removes from chess -
1) All "infinite sliders". Pieces move 1, 2, or 3 squares at most.
2) Castling is unnecessary, as pieces start more deployed than in standard forms of chess.
3) Checkmate, as there are multiple "kings", the activators, which can be captured during the game.
4) Promotion. Promotion is the attaining of a geographic objective - the other side of the board - and goal squares, like promotion valuable for victory, replace the need for promotion.

The game is a hybrid of chess and wargames, a simulation of a wargame running on a chess engine.

Thank you very much for all your explanations.
So the game is more complex than chessgame.
It is not good in my opinion to add complexity for the sake of complexity.
Anyone could multiply pieces, boards, rules and so on at infinitum.
The big challenge for the abstract game designer is to find with few rules (minimalist if possible) few pieces with at least 3 conditions :
- high replayability 
- highly addictive (you can not sleep without thinking to the game) 
- mechanics easy to understand playgame hard to master

Between us I will not even try to play your game (my opinion as player).. For sure many people will love it.
Anyway good luck to you. 
Maybe your warchess will be interesting if played by teams (3 players or more against 3 players or more).
Human brain can not handle a high level of constraints or choices or complex rules (even if the game is digitalized). 
Human brain has to be creative not acting as a robot. If it is the case then any program with little bit AI could defeat a human.
Look at the chess history. Each time you have a new champion he comes with new playgame.
An abstract game have to open big field of creativity to the players (some artistic dimension).

You're welcome for the explanation, and thanks for your comments. You do make one presumption which I find erroneous. You say: "So the game is more complex than chessgame." The game is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>different<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> than a chess game. It is war chess, neither exactly chess nor a standard wargame. The games run 30 to 40 turns, shorter than FIDE chess, for example. 

Perhaps you would be interested in some of my straight-up chess variants. For you, I would suggest looking at:
 Modern Shatranj, <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSmodernshatranj">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSmodernshatranj</a>

These were the first 3 steps I took on the road to war chess. They are all standard and well-tested chess variants. ;)

Now, is anybody else interested in a serious abstract?

The number of turns HAS NOTHING to do with complexity.
I can build very complex game (1000000 rules 10000000 pieces etc...) with 5 turns at most to finish the game.
I can build very simple game with 2 rules and 2 pieces running 10000000 turns.
