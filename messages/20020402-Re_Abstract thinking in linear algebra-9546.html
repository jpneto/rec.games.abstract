I am very pleased to be reading this.  I'm coming to the end of my
rope in a math program and my frustration seems almost normal here.
I'd like to note that I'm a non-traditional (25+ years old) student
and that I have had an "A" in every engineering/science level math
class so far.  Currently, I'm taking Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra,
among other classes.

Actually, my text has quite a bit of proof in it and my professors,
both calculus and linear algebra, teach proof during class, as well as
perform very difficult problems so we can see the techniques.  In
linear algebra we're required to prove things both in graded homework
and on tests.

But I'm frustrated because I don't like the rush.  I never have time
to consider what all this means, what he applications are, what the
implications are... it's rush off to the next problem set and memorize
the next problem solving technique.  I'm getting intellectual boredom
just from having to develop the next bunch of pointless techniques.
The more abstract classes are even worse.  I just can't imagine taking
3 months to learn analysis.  It seems ridiculously short.  People have
devoted their lifetimes to the study.  I'm not even going to scratch
the surface in 3 months.  

My answer to this has been to change my major to something lucrative
(I'll need to pay back some loans) and dedicate myself to studying
math on my own.  I can take credit by exam if I plan to get further
degrees, or I can just do it because it's interesting and relevant to
my job.  Then the torturous rush will be done.  I'll have time to
think, not time to worry about my next quiz...  What a pathetic reason
to do anything... to rush off to have someone judge whether you're
good enough yet in the tiny amount of time they've given you to think
over the material.  

I'm sure it's obvious that I'm burning out... It's just that I love
math, and thinking, and reason, but not the pell mell rush toward half
assed understanding, then being given the stamp of approval because
you can pretend you know well enough to pass.   It's harsh criticism,
but at the moment it seems like a macabre play act to me.

   Are you suggesting that a "full-blown analysis course" should be taught
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>instead<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of introductory calculus?   At what level?   To Freshmen?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This question wasn't asked of me, but I will give my answer for what
it's worth..  I think the whole system of how math is taught needs to
be reworked.  At the moment it is goal oriented... people have to be
good enough with numbers to do this or that... and to heck with the
rest.  What a holey mess.

I have a few things I wish I could see before I'm too old to enjoy it:

1.  I wish I could see logic and math taught together ... throw in a
little set theory too... at the high school level, and carried through
at each step of the way.

2.  Give people the option to learn physics, analysis and calculus
together over a period of time much much longer than presently.  Call
it a combined masters program in applied math or something... give it
about 7 years.  Or maybe we need to admit that a 4 year program isn't
very workable in math?  Let's face it.. .it's a much harder subject
than almost any other.

3.  Why should professors have to teach at breakneck speed and
practically not have time to answer questions in class?  Shouldn't a
math class take at least 2-3 hours to allow for discussion,
reflection, thought, etc?  My professors constantly have to snub
questions, or cut corners, because they simply don't have time to get
into it.  Asking for explanation during office hours is a necessary
ritual.

4.  Professors who yell or belittle students in class or out of it
should simply not be allowed to teach.  They might think they're
performing "tough love" but in reality they're destroying the one
thing that makes math possible: faith in ones self.  Math is hard
enough without having to deal with the schoolyard-level egos of some
professors too.

I think I'm experiencing many of the downsides to the current system.
But I don't see a way out of it for me.. other than to accept the
reality and move on into the applied math world... ( numerical
analysis and engineering..).. and teach myself real math on my own
time in a more suitable environment for thinking.  

Incidentally, I've placed a few quiet questions in the department and
have a couple of professor's assurance that I could occasionally ask
for a bit of help on the confusing matters.  I cannot tell you how
immensely relieved I am for that.  I hope that others who feel as I do
will find their own creative way to deal with the situation.
