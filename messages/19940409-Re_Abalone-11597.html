I have played abalone a couple of times but only with other novices. To us
it seemed to be centered completely around trying to be as passive as 
possible, and just wait for your opponent to make a mistake. Does anyone
out there have any good strategies for more agressive play?

I must admit that I played Abalone against a very aggressive female friend,
and my style of play was seriously offensive too (on the board, not off it,
I hasten to add).  We found that the game was very tense, and had no problems
with it stagnating.  I don't know if this was our error in that we didn't
try to defend much, but we didn't seem to be able to.
