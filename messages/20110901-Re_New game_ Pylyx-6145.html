It's a pie, not on a particular opening move, but on an opening
position.
In progongued play and with increasing level of play, players can
study certain set-ups in deep, so that they're able to handle both
sides of it. I don't think there's a name for it, but Swish and
Squeeze were the first games I used it in. I'm not sure if I've ever
encountered it anywhere else, but it doesn't seem a very far fetched
procedure and there are thousands of games.

Mind Ninja has it:

Actually, it hasn't. I quote from the Mind Ninja ruleset:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
1. Player 1 invents a pattern, describes it to player 2, and then takes
as many consecutive turns as he wishes (or none at all).
2. Then, player 2 decides which player is the builder, and which is the
blocker.
3. Starting with the builder, the players alternate turns.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So, if player 2 chooses to be the builder, he will also play the first
move, but if he chooses to be the blocker, he will play second.
However, in Pylyx:

a) No matter which side is chosen by player 2, he will never play
first.
b) Player 2 may decide to play first instead of choose a side. Mind
Ninja doesn't provide for this.

Mind Ninja's is a true balancing mechanism, whereas Pylyx's isn't. Of
course, it isn't a pie analogue, either.
