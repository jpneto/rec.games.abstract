Nice winning condition!   Beautifully win/loss complementary, as we
love.

Unfortunately, it seems to me to be a huuuuuuge advantage
to be the first player to grab the centre spot.  So even playing
with a move-exchange equaliser isn't going to be much good.

HOWEVER - we already know of a means to cope with a huge
advantage of this type.  The "Unlur principle", or "Chicken
principle".
(So-called due to its resemblance to the car-crashing game of
"Chicken".)

That is, a black stone is placed on the centre cell, then both players
play white stones until someone, believing white now has enough
on the board to win, announces "I'm white" in lieu of placing another
white stone, then normal play procedes with the other taking black
and making his first move immediately.

I'm so intrigued by this, that I propose starting up an email game
with
any takers, for this "Chicken Lariat", (which itself is an amusing
image!)

So, any takers, just email me, and we can get going.  Suggest a board
size.
