	Hmmmm....I do not recall who the players were, or the exact dates,
unfortunately. However, sometime in the late 1800's or early 1900's there 
was a match played between two of the strongest players of the day, with the
proviso the players could, if they wished, move the pieces on the board 
to assist in thier analysis. (Presumably, they could only do this on 
their move).
	Anyway, one player chose to take advantage of this option, the 
other did not. The player who did not move the pieces during analysis won 
the match.
	I am sure I could dig up the exact details on the contest if 
someone were interested.
