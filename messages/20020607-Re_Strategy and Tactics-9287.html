I'm not sure I understand the point of your reply, but the king has
infinite value, so checkmating the opponent's king is equivalent to
achieving a decisive material advantage.  The winning player always
eventually achieves a material advantage, if only in the final position.

Your conception ov value is entirely artificial. That you need to have a
variable go infinite is a telltale sign of a flawed model. I'm not saying the
model isn't useful. But it is useful only because we cannot comprehend the full
tree that chess game may follow. Put another way, let the value of winning the
game = 1. Since the ratio of the that value to the ration of any other piece is
infinite, those other pieces have no value. From a practical point of view,
that soulnds like nonsense, but from a fundamental point of view it's true. The
pieces are tools, not objectives. The value vector that we assign to those
tools is approximate and emperical, not inherrant.
