I've added a new abstract game to my web site, at

The game is "paddachee", a pattern achievement game.  Players alternate
marking cells with their color.  If you complete a scoring pattern (for
example, a 2x2 square) you get some points.  Most points wins.

The applet allows interactive play human-vs-human or human-vs-computer.
Computer player's ability can be adjusted.  Note that the computer player is
fairly simple, has no lookahead, but plays a strong game none-the-less.  I
will probably tweak some settings in the computer player to make it stronger.

Quite an interesting game - although the fact that the computer plays well
with no lookahead suggests it may be a bit too tactical and free-flowing.  Are
there rule versions that the computer plays poorly on - these may be the very
ones that make the best game?

I haven't found a set of patterns that the computer plays poorly on.  At
least, not compared to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> playing ability.  The simplest patterns are
squares and lines, for which a human can keep the scoring fairly low.
Patterns with a little twist in them (like an L-tetromino for example) are
so easy to achieve that the game quickly becomes a blood bath.  The computer
player is much better at seeing all the ways the patterns overlap.

So, at least playing against this program, simple patterns are better.
Four-in-a-row on the hex grid plays pretty well, with (I think) a good mix
of threat and block.  Ditto for four-in-a-row and two-by-two square on the
square grid.  The "mickey-and-minnie" variant also has some interesting
play, but it takes longer for new players to 'see' the patterns.

The computer player does have deficiencies though.  Because it plays based
on a simple weighted count of patterns, it doesn't make a distinction
between a move that creates a single threat of 2 points and a move that
creates two threats of 1 point each.  The former is easily blocked by the
opponent, while the latter produces a point that can be claimed.

It also will often leave points on the table.  That is, after making a
threat where it could claim a point, it chooses to move elsewhere rather
than claiming that point, trying to build bigger threats.  I can easily
adjust the weightings to prevent this, but I'm not convinced it's an error
in play. 

Another deficiency is that, without lookahead, it creates threats for which
the blocking move is also a strong offensive move for the opponent.

It also will not play far from the blob of previously played pieces.  It's
not clear to me whether it is better to play a weak offensive or defensive
move, near the blob, or to start new blobs in different parts of the board.

Thanks for your thoughts,
