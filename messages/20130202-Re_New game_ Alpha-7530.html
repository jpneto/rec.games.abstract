** ALPHA **

Alpha is a game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the cells of a hexhex board, which is initially empty. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of black and white stones.

Black plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one stone of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> color on an empty cell. The pie rule is used to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.

The game ends when the board is full. A player's score is the product of the size of the largest group of his color and the number of distinct groups of his color in the final position. The player with the highest score wins. In case of a tie, White wins.

I'm not sure if the object as such never showed up in the general thematic shuffle around the largest group and/or the smallest number of groups, but the either color option looks like an interesting new approach. 

The tie-rule is funny but that doesn't justify it. It interferes somewhat with the pie-rule at the start - that is supposed to solve unbalance. Dictating this solution for a draw doesn't quite agree with me I fear. I'd rather accept the possibility of a draw, though I'm aware of the controversy regarding draws of course, so there's no need to explain why I'm wrong ;-)
