Yes, I found out about 8 sided Hex after inventing Atoll.  Other than being a connection game with 8 sides, a fairly obvious variation, the two games have little in common.

I have a vast portfolio of extremely original games, Luis.  Some have turned out to be more original than others.  Cephalopod is extremely original.  So are Tanbo and Oust.

No game is an island.  There will be elements in common.  But if there's a more prolific, original abstract game designer than me, tell me now.  It certainly isn't you, Corey Clark, Christian Freeling, or douche bag, A.H.

Trisq 2.0 is less similar to Tripen than Atoll is to Eight-Sided Hex.

I don't buy that.  Dividing the Hex perimeter into eight segments is a lot more obvious than using an asymmetric token for variable cell division.  You used my idea, Luis.  You already admitted to it, and you can't take it back now.
