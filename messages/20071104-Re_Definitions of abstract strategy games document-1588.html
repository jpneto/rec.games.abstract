The problem is that
the random setup of neutral elements may create a strong advantage for
the first move player or for the second move player.  In a game like
Go, where you have a measurable advantage for the first move player at
various skill levels you can apply different handicaps at these
various skill levels to level the playing field.  You can't do that in
a game with a random initial setup of neutral elements.  So with
random initial setups of neutral elements, yes, you can have a perfect
information game but the equitableness is dubious at best.

The only way to do this is that it is either symmetric or players play
both sides.  Even then, the fact that a player goes after another
causes an unbalanced position.  So, no matter what, you face a
potential for for an unknown disadvantage.

No.  You're missing the point.  No game is perfectly balanced.  But
something can be known about the move order advantage.  For example
Othello is known to have a second move advantage.  Go is known to have
a first move advantage.  The strength of the first move advantage, as
a function of skill level, is also known in Go.  If you have a game
with a random initial setup, you don't know if there's going to be a
first move advantage or a second move advantage for any particular
random setup and you definitely don't know the strength of the move
order advantage.

For example, say you're moving first in Game X with a random initial
setup.  You may get really lucky and get an initial setup that heavily
favors the first move player.  Or you may have terrible luck and get
an initial setup that heavily favors the second move player.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well that depends on the game of course.  It may well be a game where
the setup although randomised doesn't heavily favour one player or the
other.  In that case I don't see that much of a problem to be honest.
Of course it would require a bit of analysis beforehand to work that
out.  But as with everything views differ.

When you have a wider range of openings, the end result here is that
it is a deeper game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No.  Wrong.  Depth is a characteristic of gameplay.  Chess is
considered to be a deep game.  Dots and Boxes is considered not to be
a deep game.  Wider is not deeper.

Now, granted, there is some degree of overlap.  In Backgammon, opening
setups with much fewer pieces as compared with opening setups with
much more pieces can result in gameplay of varying depth.  But if you
have a random setup of a fixed number of pieces in Chess, sometimes
that'll result in a deeper game and sometimes it'll result in a less
deep game.  Randomness in the opening setup doesn't automatically
produce a deeper game.

Yep I can agree with that.


However I think we are straying from the point somewhat.


I think part of the problem of IAGO is that there is too little deep
thinking on what it actually wants to do.  From the website it seems
that tournaments, maybe a magazine and some woolly phrase about "promoting 
abstract games".  It is trying to do too much at the initial phase IMO
its focus is spread too thin - both in activities and games.  What I
would do is have a core list of abstracts that will form the basis
of the tournaments and form an advisory committee to adjudicate on
whether any new games suggested would fit the tournament - this would
be not just on whether they think it is an abstract, but also on whether
it is too unbalanced, or it is too simple or too long for the tournament 
format.
