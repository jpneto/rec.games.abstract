Those aren't the only two possibilities.  Believe it or not, some
games (not including Chess) can both be well fought and end decisively

And?  if it's decisive every time then that is clearly not fair in a
game fought by two players on equivalent form.  You still aren't
demonstrating that draws are bad or that most people don't like them.

If I'm playing a komi in Go I usually make it an integer where draws are
 specifically made possible.  All I'd have to do to take out all
possibility of a draw is add a half point to the komi, but I (and my
friends at the Go club) don't see the point.  We don't see any necessity
or advantage in requiring a decisive result.

Your value of "robust" isn't necessarily global though.

Let's take it to the extreme and imagine that instead of 80% draws
among experts, you have 100% draws among intermediate players.  Not
too farfetched since games like that do exist.  Would you find that
entertaining?

Let's take it to reality and note that that doesn't happen in Chess,
which is the subject of this discussion, so your "point" is rather
lacking any, errr, point.

Pete.
