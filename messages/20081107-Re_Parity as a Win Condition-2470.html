In designing patterns for my game Mind Ninja (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.mindninja.com">www.mindninja.com</a>), I've
come across a type of win condition that I particularly love: parity
conditions, where one player wins when there is an odd number of
something on the board, and the other wins when there is an even
number.

It's too hard to strategize.  There's nothing you can really plan for
until the last 4 moves of the game.  There's a little window of like 2
moves where, by the time you realize what's going on, it's too late.
It's now a Nim-equivalent end game.

You're as brilliant as anybody here.  We've got our own fish to fry so
I suspect you're going to have to do it yourself.

OddGroup
The board must be completely full of stones, and there must be an odd
number of groups consisting of at least X stones.  (the pattern
chooser specifies X when proposing the pattern.  Somewhere around 7-9
seems ideal on a standard Mind Ninja HexHex board).  When counting
groups, sum over groups of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> colors.

How do you enforce that?  What if the last move of the game causes an
even number of groups to form?

Nick, move on from Mind Ninja.  It's well known and well thought of.
Yes, you could take it farther indefinitely, but it's time to do
something else.
