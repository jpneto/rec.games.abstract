It seems fairly easy to force a draw: I expect there are often cases
where you by moving back and forth between two squares can force the
other player to move back and forth between two other squares.  But it
is probably possible to place the numbers in the first phase so this
can't happen.

It sounds intersting, though I have a feeling it will be a bit too
complicated for most players.

A game with similar feel might be to have on each square one of N
symbols that can be in one of N colours and one of N sizes.  With N=4,
you get 64 different combinations, so you can fill an 8x8 board with
one of each.

A move must preserve either shape, colour or size.  Additionally, if
the previous move preserved, say, colour, you must also preseve colour
(and similar for shape and size).  If the previous move preserved more
than one property, you must preserve as many as possible of those.
This includes that, if you can't preserve any of the previous moves
preserved property, you can make any move, as long as it preserves
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> property.

An 8x8 board may be too big for this, so you could have N=2 and
distribute two of each of the 8 combinations on a 4x4 board.

You could even build a board out of tiles that have these markings.

You could even use a Set deck: Take only the cards that have one
symbols (that's 27 cards: three shapes, three colours and three
shadings), shuffle them and lay 25 of them in a 5x5 grid.
Alternatively, place them in a staggered grid like this:


        +---+
        |   |
      +-+-+-+-+
      |   |   |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   |   |   |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   |   |   |   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   |   |   |   |   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  |   |   |   |   |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   |   |   |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   |   |
      +-+-+-+-+
        |   |
        +---+

so each card has (up to) six neighbours.

With my game, it probably is easy to draw, especially if both players
allow a draw by non-ideal picks for integers in the first phase of the
game.
There is strategy involved in placing the numbers in the first phase,
I am certain. Maybe a player can lay a trap for his opponents by
choosing his numbers wisely.

I like your idea of using colors, symbols, etc instead of math rules.
(I come from a math background, and gravitate towards making games
involving numbers. But many of my math-related games can be adapted
for a more non-mathematical audience.)

Thanks,
