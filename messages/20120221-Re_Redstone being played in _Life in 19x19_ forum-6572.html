I doubt there'd be many occasions play Redstone all the
way to the end, since it would become clear who the winner
is long before then.  In this sense, it might be better than

Exactly.  What Nick said.  And what the Go expert, Topazg, said.

"The endgame could get tedious when you start filling out all your
eyes, but with skill you'll know when you've won and lost and be happy
to resign, and besides, Go is tedious when your opponent starts
playing in your territory when each stone is clearly dead."

Redstone resulted from a bizarre series of fortuitous events.  First,
the ugly duckling dropped into my lap.  Unaware of its value, I
debated even announcing it, and settled on posting a textual rule
sheet without diagrams.

I introduced Redstone to the world as Cancer, which fortunately Corey
advised against.  Then, really the main thing was Luis' suggested rule
change.  That was key, as was Luis then telling me about LifeIn19x19.
There Redstone was first ignored, then soundly derided, then played.
Then, fortuitously, Redstone turned out to be awesome.
