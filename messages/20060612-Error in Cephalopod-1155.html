Mark, I'm flattered that you chose to include Cephalopod in your
program.  Thank you for that.  However there seems to be an error.
Your program automatically captures the maximum number of dice, whereas
you should have a choice of how many and which dice you wish to
capture.

A quote from the Cephalopod rules:

"If a die is placed adjacent to three or four dice, and if two, three,
or four of its adjacent dice have a pip sum of six or less, then two,
three, or four of those dice (whose pip sum is six or less) must be
removed, and the played die must show the pip sum of the removed dice."

So, for example, you might place a die adjacent to three ones and
choose to remove only two of them.  Your program doesn't give any
option for selecting which dice to remove, as far as I can tell.  It
simply removes the maximum number.  I don't know what your program
would do if you placed a die next to four two's.  Two or three of them
would have to be selected for removal.  You couldn't remove all four of
the twos since that would add up to eight.  Likewise if you placed a
die next to three threes, two of them would have to be selected for
removal.

I'm sure it was an honest mistake on your part, but I insist that
people who make use of my games DO NOT CHANGE THE RULES.  It's plainly
stated in the Author's Note section of the rules.

I ask you to please remove your erroneous version of Cephalopod from
your program.  If you later decide to program Cephalopod correctly then
I would invite you to offer it to the public, but as it stands, it is
incorrect and is infringing upon my rights.

Next time you program one of my games, I would like to offer my
services in evaluating it BEFORE you release it.  I remember you also
made an error in the programming of another one of my games, Tanbo.  I
don't know if you ever fixed that, but if you didn't, please also
remove your erroneous version of Tanbo from your offerings.

Thanks in advance.

Your Friend,

Mark Steere
