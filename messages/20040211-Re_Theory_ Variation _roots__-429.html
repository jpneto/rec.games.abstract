I am hoping someone more versed in the mysteries of game theory might help
me out on an issue. For a given position in a given game, are there any
smooth ways to calculate which possible lines of play might have led to that
position?

Specifically, I need to do this to an early endgame position in awale (to
include in a piece of fiction).

The usual game slang for this sort of thing is "retrograde analysis".
E.g., there are chess problems where you need to prove that the last
move had to have been a pawn advance that enables an "en passant"
capture, or that a certain player is able to castle.

I don't know awale, but I have occasionally tried to generate sequences
of moves that lead to given positions in other games (chess, Conway's
"life", etc.).  Usually, either one of two things is true.  Either the
position is so constrained that it's hard to find what the last move or
last few moves were (indeed, many puzzles are built with this as the
goal), or the position is so unconstrained that there are lots of ways
to get there, and you can find one by just starting a game and making
moves for a while that seem to head in the right direction.

A middle ground that sometimes arises when a retrograde analysis
problem gives a position that appears unconstrained, is that you can
try moving forward from the starting position to see if you can reach
the given one, and after a while you find you're unable to get there,
and then a bit of thought may tell you what it was you did that made
it impossible.  ("Ohhhh, the only way that piece could be there is if
it's a promoted pawn, and for the pawn to get there it must've been
what captured the bishop back there....")
