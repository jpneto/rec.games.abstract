Newsgroups line:
comp.ai.games	Artificial intelligence in games and game-playing.

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 13 February 1995.

After this CFV appears on news.announce.newgroups it will be sent to
the mailing list COMSIM-L (mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:listserv@vmucs.ualberta.ca">listserv@vmucs.ualberta.ca</a> with
"subscribe comsim-l" in body).

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting

CHARTER

    The newsgroup comp.ai.games will provide a forum for the discussion of
artificial intelligence in games and game-playing.  The group will explore
practical and theoretical aspects of applying artificial intelligence
concepts to the domain of game-playing.
    In addition to the traditional game areas such as chess and go, the
group will also welcome those seeking to bring artificial intelligence into
other computer games.  Computer games in this context would consist of games
played by humans against computers, and by computers (including robots) against
each other.
    This newsgroup is not an appropriate place for the discussion of machine
specific coding problems, nor is it the proper place to discuss strategies
for defeating computer opponents in existing games.  There are other newsgroups
already in existence to answer these questions.

Justification:

    The subject of artificial intelligence in games has come up in
many forms in many different newsgroups.  The main groups affected by
this have been the comp.ai.* and rec.games.* newsgroups, although
every comp.sys.programmer group sees AI questions occasionally.  A
dedicated newsgroup would give these common questions a logical place,
and provide a forum for more in-depth discussion and exploration of
this subject.  In addition to providing a resource for beginners in
the field, the group would allow serious researchers a forum for the
exchange of ideas.  By bringing together people from different
backgrounds, the group would allow all participants an opportunity to
explore new directions, and allow everyone to learn from each other.
