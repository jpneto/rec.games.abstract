<br>
<br>&nbsp;i have been holding this post "unread" for awhile.
<br>&nbsp;Pentominoes really struck a major amount of chords
<br>&nbsp;in me when i was young.&nbsp; there was something so
<br>&nbsp;cool about them, like the 12 gates to the city or
<br>&nbsp;something.&nbsp; as i got familiar with them, they each
<br>&nbsp;had bad moments and good moments - they each had a
<br>&nbsp;unique personality.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;unfortunately for me i was 1st exposed to them in an
<br>&nbsp;alternate game called Pan-Kai.&nbsp; in Pan-Kai, each
<br>&nbsp;player had a complete set of the 12 pentominoes and
<br>&nbsp;the board was 10x10 instead of Golumb's 8x8.&nbsp; thus
<br>&nbsp;you had the excellent variation of walling off a piece
<br>&nbsp;that your opponent had played already.&nbsp; BUT this version
<br>&nbsp;still heavily favored the 1st player.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;this could have been a perfect game.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;it was <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>so<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> close.&nbsp; or so it seemed to my youthful eye.
<br>&nbsp;i got sucked in.&nbsp; i got swept away in this, the most
<br>&nbsp;beautiful of Distractions, the world of Abstract Games.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;see the FAQ for details, but let it be known that as far
<br>&nbsp;as i am concerned all these role playing games and avalon
<br>&nbsp;simulations are so tiny in the whole deal here.&nbsp; games
<br>&nbsp;of cards can be cool, scrabble, monopoly, all manner of
<br>&nbsp;very fine games in that genre have made their appearance.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there were all these games but the one that seemed to
<br>&nbsp;stand tall in my boyhood was Chess.&nbsp; i hated Chess because
<br>&nbsp;is was very quickly made obvious to me that the strength
<br>&nbsp;of a chess was very dependent on the ability to remamber
<br>&nbsp;move sequences of games played 10's 20's 30's and even as
<br>&nbsp;far back as 100's of years ago.&nbsp; all the winning players
<br>&nbsp;knew most of these games by heart.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;so them when my father gave us this Pentominoe game one
<br>&nbsp;christmas or so, it was a Door.&nbsp; i was wrong of course.
<br>&nbsp;but it seemed like Chess didnt have to be King.&nbsp; then i
<br>&nbsp;saw an article about Go in our local newspaper.&nbsp; there
<br>&nbsp;was a photo of a position and a writeup.&nbsp; i was curious
<br>&nbsp;as hell.&nbsp; i remember my dad cautioning me that "you could
<br>&nbsp;get your whole life lost in Go...."
<br>
<br>&nbsp;fortunately for me, after a few years of delving into it,
<br>&nbsp;i saw, again, the cooked book openings.&nbsp; but even more, i
<br>&nbsp;saw how the 1st move still had the advantage like it did in
<br>&nbsp;Chess and Pentominoes.&nbsp; still i had to give a big round of
<br>&nbsp;applause to Go for being what i thought was the Perfect Game.
<br>&nbsp;there were even Conclusions about Life and Death according
<br>&nbsp;to the shape of eye space, most notably Pentominoe shapes!
<br>
<br>&nbsp;since then, i have seen in my mind a weird thing.&nbsp; in Go
<br>&nbsp;there is a Ko rule.&nbsp; there are various rules by various
<br>&nbsp;official organizations about multiple Ko rules.&nbsp; there is
<br>&nbsp;a contingent that says these rules are all saying the same
<br>&nbsp;thing eventually.&nbsp; i regard the fact that they needed to make
<br>&nbsp;a rule about the Ko as a DEFECT in the game.&nbsp; most games i
<br>&nbsp;have met have many more defects, often hundreds.&nbsp; so when
<br>&nbsp;i say Go has 1 defect, that is still impressive.&nbsp; but then
<br>&nbsp;i thought about the 1st move advantage &amp; now think Go has
<br>&nbsp;2 defects.&nbsp; HOWEVER!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>&nbsp;let me state right here that the Ko rule in Go has created
<br>&nbsp;some of the world's most amazing sequences of play ever
<br>&nbsp;recorded in the history of mankind.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;for me, if the Rule uses any language like "except", then
<br>&nbsp;it is perilously close to a Defect Exposed &amp; Dealt With via
<br>&nbsp;this Rule.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;this would naturally assume that the Perfect Game has no such
<br>&nbsp;defects....LOL.&nbsp; so maybe that isnt True?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;so i spent a lot of time getting into Go and feeling smug
<br>&nbsp;about my 1st impressions of Chess and so on.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;but when Bobby Fisher played Boris Spassky on PBS and Shelby
<br>&nbsp;Lyman had all those wonderful guests....wow - see, most
<br>&nbsp;sports fans talk about action games like football or basketball
<br>&nbsp;or baseball....but for me I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT for
<br>&nbsp;each move, even though this was no longer my Standard of
<br>&nbsp;Abstract Games.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;if it had been a Pentominoes Championship on TV...........
<br>
<br>&nbsp;2001: A Space Odyssey originally tried to imagine that in
<br>&nbsp;the future they would be playing Pentominoes instead of
<br>&nbsp;Chess or Go and that was how they originally had HAL
<br>&nbsp;scripted, but after the trial balloons, they sadly fell
<br>&nbsp;back to the western world's comfortable Chess.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;so no....Pentominoes had a great opportunity, but not
<br>&nbsp;the follow-through.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;it's a damn shame.&nbsp; now we have a computer-generated
<br>&nbsp;solution saying the 8x8 game is solved as a win for the
<br>&nbsp;1st player.......yeah.&nbsp; not really a surprise....
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;cheers, and great to see another Pentominoe fan.
