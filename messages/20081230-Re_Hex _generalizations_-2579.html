Technically, this is NOT a 7x7 Hex game, for two reasons.

The most important reason is, all experienced Hex players and all the
Hex servers on the Net use the swap rule. After the very first stone is
placed on the board the second player has the option at that moment
only to swap sides. This makes the game much more balanced and
interesting. But here, after 6  moves by each side, swapping sides in Y
is forbidden.

A non-issue, surely? If you trust your opponent to build the borders
before starting the alternative game, then you should trust your
opponent to play the first move of the alternative game, and offer you a
swap, before the artificial borders are constructed.

The bad Y moves that led to the 7x7 Hex position were LEGAL.
Swapping sides in the middle of a Y game is ILLEGAL, regardless of what 
the players might think. So now you are talking about some modified rule 
set. The claim that Hex is some sort of "subset" of Y, now turns out to 
be a claim that Hex is some sort of subset of a variant of Y.
