|There have been numerous games which have followed this general format
|of ranked pieces, but Stratego was not the first and L'attaque is
|generally accepted as the first produced version.
|
|Others in the same group would include:
|
|Dover Patrol (Naval version)
|Tri-Tactics  (Combined arms)
|Aviation  (Aircraft version)
|Swords &amp; Wizardry (Fantasy version)
|The Generals (which included a clever electronic device for
|determining the outcome of battle).
|
|And of course, Stratego and all its variants and imitators.

There's also Jungle, a sort of cross between Chinese Chess and
Stratego, with no hidden information. I dunno how long it's been
around, but from what I hear, it can be obtained throughout China
and the Chinese sections of any US city. You can play Jungle if you
download the Zillions demo at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/</a>
It may be intended as a children's "stepping stone" to "serious"
chess.
