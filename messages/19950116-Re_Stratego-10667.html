How about showing us your proof?  Or at least saying what you mean
by "failed"?

Stratego is an elegant and fun game.  But I've never been quite
sure how to interpret and/or generalize the rule prohibiting
repetitions, i.e. the one that reads:
"No piece may be shifted more than 5 times back and forth in the same
2 squares."

The old rules were more explicit, and called for no more than 3. Basically, 
however, what don't you get? If i move left, right, left, right, left, right,
what have i done? violated the rule. similarly, r,l,r,l,r,l or forward, back,
forward, back, forward, back, or b,f,b,f,b,f. It is only to keep people from
running back and forth with a threatened piece and trying for a draw that way,
and it is a good rule. As you may intuit, the person who starts moving back and
forth has to break the pattern first.

There was a swirling mass of water that lived in a quiet pond, which asked
permission of its master to visit all the lands beyond. And its master allowed
it to fly, so the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky. The whirlpool's
mother wore a jacket she'd sewn out of dental floss. It was stolen by a monkey
who sold it to an albatross. And it had the idea to fly, so the wind swept the
whirlpool across the sky.
