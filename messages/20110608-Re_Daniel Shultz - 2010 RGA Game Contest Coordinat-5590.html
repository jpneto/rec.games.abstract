The answer is 4.6% of all possible votes result in a draw.

Below is my combinatorial analysis which answers the above question.
I have verified my analysis with a very simple
computer program which I can provide on request.  If anyone would care
to see/run the program, I'll post it to the r.g.a. resource
page.

1)

Since there are 3! (6) ways to vote and 5 players, there are 6^5
(7776) possible ways to vote.

2)

For any ranking using this method, the total of all points is going to
be 5*5 + 3*5 + 5 = 45 points.
So the only way a 3 way tie can occur is when the points for each game
totals 45/3 = 15 points.

3)
For a jury of 5 players there are two ways in which a sum of 15 can be
formed:

5+5+3+1+1
5+3+3+3+1

But for there to be a 3 way tie, there must be 5 5's, 5 3's and 5 1's
as per the results:

X: 5+5+3+1+1  = 15
Y: 5+3+3+3+1  = 15
Z: 5+5+3+1+1  = 15

Where (X,Y,Z can be any assignment of K,M,S)

In other words, there is no other possible way for there to be 5 each
of 5's, 3's and 1's
and have each row sum to 15 other than the configuration shown above.
Note, I have replaced
the specific game with X, y and Z.  Which can be replaced with any
actual game (e.g. M, K, S).

This can be summarized as follows:

Two of the games must be the first pick for exactly 2 voters, the 2nd
pick for exactly one voter, and
a third pick for exactly 2 voters.

The other game must be a first pick for exactly one voter, a 2nd pick
for 3 voters, and a 3rd pick
for one voter.

4) Back to:

A: MKS
B: SKM
C: MKS
D: SMK
E: KSM

Making this more generic so that (K,M,S can be assigned arbitrarily to
X,Y,Z) we have:

A: XYZ
B: ZKX
C: XYZ
D: ZXY
E: YZX

There are 5! (120) ways to permute the above, but since XYZ appears
twice we must divide out 2! yielding
60 combinations.

3 games (K,M,S) can be assigned to 3 variables in 3! (6) ways (e.g. X
= K, Y = M, Z = S, X = M, Y = S, Z = K, etc...)
so 60*6 (360) possibilities

5)
Therefore:

360/7776 or 4.6% of all possible votes are ties.

QED.
