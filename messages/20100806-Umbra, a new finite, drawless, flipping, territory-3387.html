Years ago I proposed a finite flipping game to Joao Neto. He liked it
but I asked him not to post it because I was not completely satisfied
for reasons I cannot recall now, perhaps just lack of confidence in
myself. I called it "Eclipse" but that is now the name of several
other games, so the tentative title is now "Umbra" and it went like
this:

A player can drop a piece anywhere he wants provided there is either a
friendly piece or an empty space in relationship X to it.  If the
piece dropped has relationship X to a friendly piece already on the
board, then all enemy pieces that have relationship Y to the dropped
piece are flipped. When the board is full, the player with the most
pieces wins. Draws cannot occur on boards with an odd number of spaces
(I used 9x9, 11x11 a lot). Pie rule if desired: black starts and white
has the option to change colors on his second move.

I experimented with a lot of X's and Y's (so there are potentially
quite a few different games) and wrote Zillions implementations for
most of them, but the most fundamental game is X=adjacent Y=horizontal
or vertical row of uninterrupted pieces. Another game, more stable
with less flipping and more permanent territory building is
X=diagonally adjacent Y=horizontal or vertical row. I think I
currently favor this version.  There are a lot of parity situations,
such as avoiding being the first to play into a region that has an
even number of spaces, etc., and there are a lot of tactics, although
I never analyzed it enough to know much about full-board strategy,
although there is definitely a territorial component.

You can play a small verson on an Othello set by blocking off one row
and column and playing a 7x7 game. You can also play on the full 8x8
board if you don't mind the possibility of a draw.

Anyone who owns Zillions and wants to try it can contact me for the
Zillions files.
