You analyzed the shit out of it but you didn't play the shit out of it.  The one time I played you, I blundered, giving away a 6, and I was still able to turn the game around and win.

No Luis and I chatted about it for a good hour. And don't give me that shit how I'm involving other people. Luis didn't do it to show you up and neither did I. We were just analyzing Cephalopod objectively and reached the conclusions I mentioned before.

That isn't true.  Cephalopod is a fairly ordinary game in which experience &gt;and skill directly effect one's chances of winning.

sorry that might be what you want Cephalopod to be but it isn't.

I'm still not buying into this bizarre paradraw shit.  Why does a board with &gt;an odd number of spaces have an "extra space"?  Is there some unwritten &gt;presumption that a board should have an even number of spaces?  Does Go have &gt;an "extra" point?  You'd still be able to win at Cephalopod on an even board.  &gt;You'd just have to win by two.

Yes but with reasonable play I highly doubt that Cephalopod would not draw on an even sized board. There is no way to maintain a material advantage and the distribution of pieces comes to an equilibrium as the color of captured pieces matters very little and each player has an equal number of turns.

If it were Nim, there'd be a system for winning, which you obviously haven't discovered.

Just because some of the moves matter doesn't mean all 100+ of them do. I imagine it wouldn't take as much analysis as you'd expect. Although as soon as I have the opportunity I'll talk to Tristan Parker about this. He is surely the foremost expert on Cephalopod so if he can create a compelling argument then I'll retract my statement... but spoilers (I highly doubt he will).
