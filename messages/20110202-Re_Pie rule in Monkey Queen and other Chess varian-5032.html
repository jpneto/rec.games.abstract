The pie rule ruins Monkey Queen according to one guy,
who happens to be a good Shogi and Chess variants

rule prevents White (Player 1) from "exploring the depth

Well that's what he said, more or less.  Maybe Gamer-man can come here and

That's an opinion.

And was not intended to be anything else  :)

Of course.

That I disagree with.  Checkers is ruined and people like to play that. 
Abalone is certainly ruined.  The only question with these ruined games is,
"How many times can you play it before it turns to mush?"  Chess isn't real
far behind Checkers on the non-robust classic games list, though it
certainly has more mileage than Checkers.

The theory continues, "Xyz Chess variant has great
gameplay but there's an overwhelming first move
advantage and draw rate."

I'm just not buying that.  Robustness and quality of play
are two different things, but they're closely related, I
believe.  I don't want a game that people only want to
play if they can move first.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

An "overwhelming" first move advantage will not make any
game popular. The magnitude of the errors beginners make
at Chess largely outmeasures the first move advantage. By
the time they're pro's it matters of course, but the Chess
community at large doesn't seem to see it as a problem, nor
do the results indicate there's a major problem (as they do
in Draughts).

Sometimes one needs to look beyond statistics.  Standards improve but Chess
remains the same.

Regarding not wanting a game that people only want to
play if they can move first, you don't have to make one,
nor play one so I don't see any major problem there
either.

Of course.  My point was not to create a grudge over first move advantage
deluged games, but rather to stimulate a discussion about what impact the
pie rule has on simple Chess variants like Monkey Queen.
