Richard Hutnik uttered in bgg:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
... a game like chess would end up fitting under
both the abstract and the strategy subcategories,
and be able to accurately reflect it is an
'abstract strategy' game."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That seemingly meaningless statement was Hutnik-speak for something.
But what?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
We could then also, without less concern, be
able to have games that are also abstract, but
not games in the strategy category, here."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Aha!  A clue.  Apparently, a game can be abstract while not being in
the "strategy category".  Hmmm.  What would be an example of such a
game?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Would anyone here argue Moonstone, or Riccochet
Robots are strategy games? . . . If they aren't,
then how does them being abstract make them abstract
STRATEGY games? I just don't see it."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ricochet Robots!  The long standing question, "What abstract game
doesn't have strategy?" has at last been answered.  Ricochet Robots.
[shaking head in stunned unbelief]

Richard Hutnik, president of the International Abstract Games
Organization, has now informed the abstract games community that
Ricochet Robots is an abstract game and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> an abstract game.

Wow, all this time wasted not talking about Ricochet Robots here in
rec.games.abstract.  If only Hutnik had rescued us sooner.

Richard Hutnik, president of the International Abstract Games
Organization, are you just going to leave us hanging here in
rec.games.abstract?  I think you have a duty to explain iago's
standpoint on abstract games to the readership.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Oh yes, and we need a moderate amount of dexterity
to move pieces properly on a board. So, does that
then make every single game out there with pieces on
a board "dexterity" games?"
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ohhhh, I see!  So <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> why Batik is an abstract game according to
Richard Hutnik.  Because every game is, after all, a game of
dexterity.   Batik just requires a little more dexterity than other
abstract games.

Batik:

Rich, turn off the ipod, put down the brewski, and listen carefully
because this is important.  You're an idiot.  You're a stupid, stupid
idiot.  Go away, and never discuss your perverted, Ricochet Robot view
of abstract games with anybody, ever again.  Ever!!

The problem is not that you're discrediting yourself, Rich.  You've
been doing that since you first opened your mouth on the forums.  The
problem is that you're discrediting abstract games.  Why would you
even want to do that?

The fact that you're a designer, with that stone henge game or
whatever, makes it especially hard to understand.  What, nobody liked
your game?  And now you're thirsty for revenge??

Richard Hutnik, stop discrediting my art.
