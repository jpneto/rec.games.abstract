<br>You start the game with any number of plates with (small :-) stones on 
them. A move consists of removing any positive number of stones from 
exactly one plate.
<br>
<br>JUSTICE: if after your move there is the same number of stones on each 
of the plates then you ** WIN ** (and your opponent loses).

<br>INJUSTICE: if after your move there is the same number of stones on each 
of the plates then your opponent wins, you ** LOSE **.

<br>Justice is the game that's more similar to Nim. With an even number of 
plates, I think that it yields to the same analysis as Nim. This is 
because every losing position (equal stones on all plates) is a 
first-player loss in Nim.
<br>
<br>For an odd number of plates, that's not the case. For an odd number of 
plates, n &gt; 0 stones on each plate is a first-player win in Nim.
