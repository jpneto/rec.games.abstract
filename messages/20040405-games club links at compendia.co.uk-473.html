I'm from, Compendia, the traditional games shop and website. I'm
building a clubs and societies links page and would love to hear from
anyone who'd like to be listed.

We have decided to launch the page with a little bit of April
Foolishness. Throughout April all clubs and their members will be able
to claim a 10% discount at our online shop <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.compendia.co.uk">www.compendia.co.uk</a>. This
offer includes members of online groups.

The idea behind the page is to give our casual customers the
opportunity get involved in the world of games. We hope that members
of clubs might be interested to try a new game to see if it suits
them. Compendia's aim is to carry a broad range of games, so that our
customers can dip into something they might not normally try, be it a
Backgammon enthusiast playing Coppit with his kids or a Scrabble
fanatic who wants to try Shove Ha'penny.

To claim your discount place the order and in the box that says "How
did you find our site" put in "April Foolishness" and the name of the
club or group you belong to. The website will bring up the full amount
and we will calculate your discount when we send out your game.
