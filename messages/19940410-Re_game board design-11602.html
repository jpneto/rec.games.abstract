I don't see how a 1b and 5b can be in the same row--if values change

Easy.  Move the 5's toward each other until in the correct rows, then white
starts moveing his 5 back and forth horizontally while black bring up a 
second peice (doesn't matter which).  Next the two teams move the 5s back
and forth until the new peice decays to a one.

As for making a physical board, stacking checkers and colored chits will work
for the current strength and decay status.  The chits need not be 1-99, 
as 1-11 will do just as well (it doesn't matter how many times the current
peice has decayed, only how long till the next decay)  The master color wheel
just rotates through the 11 colors.  When a peice is moved, put a chit 
matching the current turn in place of it's old one.

The only thing which the representations thus far don't represent is that 
peices only promote or demote when they have moved a number of rows equal 
to their current strength (if I read the rules correctly).  This means
they would need a sort of 'first down marker' for each peice to show
where their promotion was due.

A more serious problem is that this game will need about 70 checkers,
hundreds of color chits (over a thousand if you want to ensure there is
no possibillity of running out of a particular color), and would take
more than can be reasonably expected of a "portable travel set" to
produce or carry.

P.S. for an "at home" set, you only need one normal checker set, the board,
a bunch of "neutral color" checkers for the underside (so you don't need as
many), the decay chits, and the first down markers (which may be difficult
to administer).  Definately doable if you don't mind a pretty big price tag.
