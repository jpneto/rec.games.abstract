I'm surprised you didn't mention Go here, since it has a bigger game

Go is often mentioned in discussions of large game trees.  I think
it's a little overestimated though.  Starting out you've got 361
places to move and then 360 and so on, so there is of course a
tremendous branching factor.  A crude estimate of the number of final
board positions would be 3^361.  Each of the 361 intersections can be
empty, black, or white.  (It's a high estimate because you'll usually
end up with the board approximately half filled.  You won't have a
final position with 3 stones on the board.)  You can always move
anywhere you want, except eyes.  On top of that it's a difficult game
to program, adding to the mystique.  But the thing that's often
overlooked is redundancy.  There are a gazillion ways to arrive at any
particular position, effectively reducing the game tree size to a
something manageable for humans.  In other words the possibilities
aren't so astronomical that you never are able to form any kind of a
strategy.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm a big fan of Go equipment.  I've designed 5
games for it in the past 16 years: Tanbo, Rush, Crossway, Oust, and
Palisade (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://marksteeregames.com">http://marksteeregames.com</a>).  I believe in simple rules and
simple equipment.  Equipment doesn't get much simpler than that of Go.

Then there's the game of Gess, which seems to have been deliberately
devised to be a game for supergeniuses and extraordinarily difficult
for computers.

I can't imagine a more cumbersome game.  Game equipment should be used
(I believe) in the manner for which it was originally intended.  So
for example, stones should be added, not moved, one at a time, and
occasionally a stone placement is accompanied by the removal of a
group of stones.
