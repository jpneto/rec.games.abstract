<br>So, an association promoting abstract strategy games should handle
<br>them?
<br>
<br>Can you please give your boundaries for what should or should not be
<br>in an association to promote abstract strategy games?&nbsp; Would poker,
<br>bridge or other cardgames count?&nbsp; Should a key be there is a strategic
<br>linking of pieces in games of the association that have an impact and
<br>an overall strategy?&nbsp; This would knock out cardgames.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Not all of them.&nbsp; In Doomtown, for instance, many important cards are
<br>played and moved in a board-game-like fashion.&nbsp; (However, it also
<br>features random chance, hidden information, and a strong theme, so no
<br>one involved in these recent threads would call it "abstract".)
