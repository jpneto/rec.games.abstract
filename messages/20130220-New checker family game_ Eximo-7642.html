###  EXIMO  ###

Member of the Checkers family, Eximo has orthogonal and diagonal movement and capture. There are no kings, only men. Men can jump without capturing. When a man reaches the last row, it frees another man.


SETUP
On a 8x8 square board, Black has his pieces on b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2,b3, c3, f3, g3; White on b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7,b6, c6, f6, g6.

OBJECT
Capture all your opponent's pieces by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.

MOVE AND CAPTURE
Checkers can move or capture.

A checker can move in 3 directions: forward or diagonally forward (north, north-east or north-west).

There are two type of move: ordinary move and jumping move.

- ORDINARY MOVE: a checker moves to a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent and empty square.
- JUMPING MOVE: a checker jumps over a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent friendly piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. If the same player's checker can continue moving by jumping another friendly piece then it must do so. (No need to choose the longest path.)

A checker can capture in 5 directions: forward, diagonally forward, right or left (north, north-east, north-west, east or west).

- CAPTURE: a checker jumps over a (forward, diagonally forward, right or left) adjacent opponent's piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. The opponent's piece is removed from the board immediately. If the same player's checker can continue capturing by jumping another opponent's piece then it must do so. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep capturing as long as it is possible. (No need to take the maximum number of pieces.)

ON THE LAST ROW
When a checker reaches the other end of the board, it is removed from the board immediately and the player gets two extra-moves to make instantly: dropping two new checkers in any empty square in his own first two rows, except in the four squares on the sides.
(The dropping zone for Black: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2; for White: b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7).

If a checker reaches the other end of the board and there isn't any empty square in the drop zone, the player loses that piece. If there are just one empty square in the drop zone, the player gets only one drop.
