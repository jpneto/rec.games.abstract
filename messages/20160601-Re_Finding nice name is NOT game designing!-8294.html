I really love the name Connecticut as game name.
How many variant of Hex I proposed even with territory control (half-move) and with "stars" where the player could place 2 to 6 of his color on his turn (HAO).More than that I did not publish many of hex variants using other mechanics (other than Othello).
Hey Corey! You are a crappy designer. Nothing new will emerge from your "brain". Only shit pieces.

Hex game is build on a single idea :
You have 4 zones : east-west-north-south
If you join using a line the east and west which are opposites  you can not join using another line the north and the south (and vice-versa). Either I cut you either you cut me (ties are impossible). Only one winner is possible. 
As you are using tokens or stones you have to find a board form fitting that objective.
YOU HAVE 10000000000000 BOARDS POSSIBLES.
YOU HAVE THOUSANDS WAYS TO REACH THAT OBJECTIVE MODIFYING ALL THE PARAMETERS (boards, kind of stones, move protocols (ways to places stones) etc....
ALL OF YOU FAKE GAME DESIGNERS YOU DID NOT USE MORE THAN A TINY PERCENTAGE  OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE.
