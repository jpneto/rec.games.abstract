By nature I am a 'themed' boardgamer, and have been for the past 40 years. 
Whilst I don't play many 2-player abstract games I can still admire them and do
have a large number in my collection.

As a regular contributor to a UK Boardgaming Magazine I am working on an
article devoted to currently available (not games from the past) abstract games
- a subject that gets minor coverage in the magazine but which should, I feel,
not be ignored..  

Not being a regular player of such games myself I would seem an unsuitable
person to write such a piece.   On the other hand the thrust of my intersest
does reflect the readership, so in that respect I am the ideal person perhaps. 
 A sort of 'Devil's Advocate'.

Most of my favourites are now unobtainable so this rules them out.   And since
these games are not easily encountered even in the specialist shops I seek help
from this Newsgroup as to the ones I should look out for.   Those on my
extremely short list at the moment are the GIPF series, BLOKUS and CHEBACHE.  
I'd be pleased to receive any other suggestions.   And if you can also supply
some form of contact address (e-mail, website, etc) I'd be even more grateful.

Thanks
