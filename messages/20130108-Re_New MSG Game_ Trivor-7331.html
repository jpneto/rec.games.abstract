I had to go through all this with Christian Freeling, who sincerely believed that his game Symple was "perfectly balanced". In the end he had to admit that Symple is no more balanced than Hex with pie. Of course it wasn't that easy. I had to let him drive himself into a logical brick wall over and over again for more than a year, but finally he'd had enough.

But you're right I finally had enough when it turned out you were still in the dark about the nature of the penalty and Luis had to put you straight:

Let me cite you:
****
"Symple's balance is still a concern though. Why did Christian gradually change the parameter from at least 2 to at least 4 to at least 6? It has to be a balance issue. As skill levels slowly increase, so must the minimum value of the parameter. What else could be the reason for increasing it? Is it too tactical at the smaller parameter values? Too opaque? Those aren't reasons to strictly rule out the smaller parameters.  It has to be an ongoing balance issue. 

I actually want to play Symple a few times, admittedly to see how bad it is..

****

Of course "changing the parameter" is a "tweak" instead of a choice the players can make, and when Hyper wants clarification of a rule, it's an "ambiguity". You don't even read or try to understand.

Go on Mark, you'll make it yet to a funny footnote in Symple's history ;-)
