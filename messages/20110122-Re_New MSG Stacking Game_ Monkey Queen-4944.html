I'm anticipating a change to Monkey Queen - a shift to a 10x10 board.  In
the original version of Monkey Queen, where the babies moved like Chess
kings, the 8x8 was too big.  The babies were slowly marching across the vast
board.  But now in MQ v2 the babies move like queens, not kings.  When you
have two queens moving around an 8x8 board, leaving queen-like babies
behind, it fills up fast.  Too fast.  Queens have a much further reach than
kings and they need a bigger playground to spread their wings in.

It occured to me that babyrooks would be speedy without, possibly,
overcrowding an 8x8 board.
Of course I know that suggesting a change is the best way to avoid
having it considered, but I couldn't resist ;-)

On a general note: leaving the whole stack idea in favor of a king
spawning an army of its own pieces, a limited number but of a diverse
composition, might hold a game or two too. I'm almost tempted, but for
the fact that chesslike systems usually require arbitrary choices. And
at the moment my mind is not exactly welcoming the thought of that.
