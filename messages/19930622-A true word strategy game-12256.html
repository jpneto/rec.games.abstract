In general, I have been dissappointed in "word" games, Scrabble's okay, Boggle
wasn't bad the first few times, Word Rummy, Upwords, etc. just don't capture
the imagination the way Abalone, Terrace and Pente do.  This is a slight 
problem because my wife much prefers word games.

Yesterday, I found the solution: Overturn.

Overturn is offered by Pressman (the makers of Othello!) and it is quite clear
that they wanted their packaging to reflect the connection.  It is the first
time I've seen a reasonable integration of the two styles of games.

There is no luck involved (getting the right tiles), there is no speed involved
(ala Boggle - players alternate turns), and there is definate strategy
involved.

The board is an 8x8 grid of letters that are randomly set-up at the beginning.
Players then alternate by "taking" words on the board.  This is done by placing
a colored ring around each of the letters.  The letters of the word must be
connected (8-neighbors sense) and can change direction as often during the 
word as desired.

Anytime a player uses a letter from a word "taken" by the opponent, the colored
ring is flipped indicating that the letter now belongs to the player.  In this
sense it is very reminiscent of Othello.  The winner, of course, is the player 
with the most letters at the end.

Kudos to those involved for successful integration of two dissimilar game 
styles.
