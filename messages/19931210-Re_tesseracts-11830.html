When I saw the original question I prepared this reply, but I was
waiting until I thought of an answer the the second half.  I haven't
found an easy one yet, so here's the part I do have.

   &gt; i am trying to include a 4-dimesional "room" in a game i am designing,
   &gt;  but cant remember which rooms connect to which rooms by which doors 


   Hmm ... the following simple scheme occurs to me now.  It seems to be
   both correct and useful.

   Number the eight rooms in binary from 000 to 111.  Every room
   connects to six of the seven others, and the exception is the
   one whose binary designation is the complement.  So room 010,
   for example, connects to every room except 101.

   Now as for which doorway leads where, that seems a little
   vaguer.  I presume you want to have your layout such that
   traveling through four doorways in the "same direction" brings
   you back to where you are.


If you start in room 000 assign the numbers 001, 010, and 100 to the
rooms to your east, north, and above you respectively, then you can
make the following circuits:

northward:	000 -&gt; 001 -&gt; 111 -&gt; 110 -&gt; 000
eastward:	000 -&gt; 010 -&gt; 111 -&gt; 101 -&gt; 000
upward:		000 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 111 -&gt; 011 -&gt; 000

I haven't thought of a simple scheme that just gives you the general
case.

These north, east, and up terms are somewhat bogus, because every
time you go through a door you must turn a corner that involves the
fourth dimension.  Let's suppose that the same magic that got you a
four dimensional maze takes care of that quandary for you.
