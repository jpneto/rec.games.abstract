That's hugely positive to me.  Less complex rules (without ko), more complex

Thing is, billions (literally) of people play Go, there are paid teachers, courses, clubs, online servers by the dozen, televised games etc. Therefore well over 99.99% of people who have played one, the other, or both, will play Go before they play Redstone. Once they've got to grips with it, the incentive to relearn some of the intricacies that are fundamentally difficult to grapple with a new game won't be there. It's there for me because I love a new abstract game, but I'm a rare kind - most people stick with what they know.

Would would I take offense? The fact your opinion is misguided is not my problem. If you'd seen me on the chess forums I enjoy, you'd have said the same about chess, or video games I play, or whatever. You've only seen me in a Go context, so it's a natural conclusion, albeit an erroneous one.

My youngest daughter is slowly picking up chess, because that caught her attention more. I have no interest in promoting Go over anything else because it's the hobby at which I'm the most knowledgeable.

I'm enjoying Redstone, but I'm not convinced which I'll consider to be a better game when I've got the hang of the complexities, particularly in Life and Death. My initial suspicion is that Go will feel more elegant, and thus appeal to me more. That's not only subjective but could also be familiarity biasing my decision, but I'm not sure whether the added complexity in redstone adds, detracts, or doesn't do either to the game.

Either way I'll still <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> Go more because the community is bigger, but I would concede Redstone to be the better conceived game if I felt that way. I was a diehard Hex fan, but I was still convinced by Atoll.

Huh? That's a kinda odd question, particularly on an abstract games group?

Objectively, there's a lot of ongoing sente/gote in
Go.  There's a lot of that in Tanbo too.  In Oust, you do have to be mindful
of sente in the opening game.  White definitely starts out in gote.  But
once he safeties a stone, White is no longer in gote, and the sente/gote
issue pretty much disappears.  You definitely don't have players drawing out
the next twelve moves for each other.  Automatic moves exist in all games.. 
They're more the rule than the exception in Go.  In Oust, automatic moves
are a rarity.

I will be interested to see when I've played it some.

In our private discussion (sorry, but in the interests of time) I think you
said there's no such thing as a world renowned abstract game designer.  Of
course, abstract games are extremely esoteric.  But, if you're a connoisseur
of abstract games, you've heard of me and Christian.  If you haven't, you're
not a connoisseur.

None of this contradicts my statement.

Yes, Oust will compete on that scale, given the passage of enough centuries,
simply because it's a better game.

I have a suspicion you may be in a minority of one that holds that opinion. I'll be very surprised if it sees 2050 in general circulation.

I suspect Oust will be much easier for an AI to play than
Go or Chess,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You're outstandingly wrong on that point, Graham.  Go absolutely has a
larger game tree.  But practically speaking, most of that tree never gets
used.  In Go you typically capture a handfull of singletons during the
course of a long, relatively tame game.  Oust, by comparison, is much more
aggressive.  Larger groups do get captured regularly.  Practically speaking,
the statement "It never plays the same way twice" holds truer in Oust than
in Go.  In Go, an expert player can remember all of the moves in the game.. 
That'd be a lot more difficult in Oust.  I believe that the practical play
portion of Oust's tree is larger than Go's.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Hmmmm, have you tried writing much game AI? Some of what you're saying doesn't make sense with regards to what AI struggles with compared to what it finds easy. I suspect within a few games, I'd be able to remember an Oust game, whereas it took me a few years to do it with Go with any confidence, simply because sequential memory takes over. There will only be a few available moves that will recreate the sequence and patterns that you memorise, and the board is smaller. Evidence for either of these claims?

Add to that that Oust is counterintuitive.  You can get down to one stone
against tens of enemy stones and come back and win.  You often have to "lose
in order to win" in Oust.  Difficult as Go is to program, Oust will be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
harder.

Again, evidence?
