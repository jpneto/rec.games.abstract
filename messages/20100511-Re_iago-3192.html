Wrong - if you look at the game "drop area" there will typically be odd
looking holes resulting from the haphazard way other pieces have come to
rest.  Even assuming these pieces were somehow fixed for the purpose of the
move, a player would not be able to say for certain whether a particular
piece would fit into the whole without performing arbitrarily careful
measurements.  (Or the player can take a guess using their visual skill.)
Knowing the pieces is not the issue - the issue is that pieces in the drop
area will be lying at a continuum of possible locations and orientations...

b) c) d) and e) are implementation issues. You could avoid them almost
completely by building a special, high-quality set - or you could take
them completely away with a computer implementation. The idea of the
game is abstract, but you could say the concrete implementation
isn't.

Yes, I said that the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>idea<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> behind Batik could be used to come up with a
true abstract game.  However, as things stand Batik would not be considered
such.

E.g. you could have something resembling a Tetris grid, with fixed columns
for dropping the pieces, and fixed orientations for the pieces, and then
perhaps the pieces behave logically like tetris pieces when they drop?
There would then be a finite number of moves each player could make, and the
results of the moves would be totally defined within the rules, so that
would overcome all the objections.  But it's not the game of Batik I've seen
described!  (Best to give it a new name, if someone genuinely proposes the
game I've described.  Perhaps I could suggest the name "Batris"?  A sort of
cross between Batik and Tetris, if you will!)  Batris could perhaps be
played as a flat board game, or obviously as a computer game, but I think
the idea of physically dropping the pieces could be tricky to implement.

Most people don't mind. Mark Steere minds because he's jealous of the

I never mentioned minding or not minding anything, and I've no idea who made
the game, although I'm beginning to suspect it might be you?  (Don't worry,
I won't be marketting Batris, and I hereby renounce any rights this posting
might give me over the game :-)

My personal view is that on this NG people generally use "abstract game" in
a particular way which obviously precludes Batik as described.  This seems
sensible because it captures the interest of the people who frequent (hehe)
this newsgroup.

Elsewhere the phrase may have other meanings - language is as language does,
etc..  As to how IAGO uses the phrase, I really don't care.  Presumably IAGO
can define it however it likes, and it will catch on or not.  We should just
keep in mind that an IAGO game may not be an abstract game as understood
here...
