Could I please get the group's recommendations for the best Abstract
Strategy games?
I would prefer games that are easily played with only two people.  I
tend to gravitate towards backgammon, dominoes, card games and other 
traditional games.  I've had my eye on Cathedral for while.

My favourite (in print) abstracts:

ZERTZ: original, beautifully made, very deep, and forces your brain to
go round corners :)

GO: elegantly simple; very, very deep; and a built-in handicapping
system for people of different abilities.

TAMSK: sister to ZERTZ, a territorial game played with egg-timers where
your thinking time is part of the strategy.  Guaranteed to be a fast
game, and very original.

ENTROPY (HYLE in Germany): Order and Chaos battle on a 7x7 grid.  Order
tries to make palindromic sequences of coloured discs, chaos tries to
prevent him.  Nice mixture of strategy and playing the odds.

OCTI: very intuitive game where you get to move OR enhance the
manoeuverability of your pieces.  One move can cause you to totally re-
evaluate the position.

Many others: GIPF, PLATEAU, GYGES, AVALAM, LoA, AMAZONS, ...

TTFN,
