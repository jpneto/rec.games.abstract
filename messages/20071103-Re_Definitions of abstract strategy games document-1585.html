I disagree with that.  Randomizing the positions of neutral elements

a turn can result in a perfect information game.

I should of made that, it is a potential to be unfair.  And yes,
perfect information is possible, but the setup not be fair.

The problem is that
the random setup of neutral elements may create a strong advantage for
the first move player or for the second move player.  In a game like
Go, where you have a measurable advantage for the first move player at
various skill levels you can apply different handicaps at these
various skill levels to level the playing field.  You can't do that in
a game with a random initial setup of neutral elements.  So with
random initial setups of neutral elements, yes, you can have a perfect
information game but the equitableness is dubious at best.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The only way to do this is that it is either symmetric or players play
both sides.  Even then, the fact that a player goes after another
causes an unbalanced position.  So, no matter what, you face a
potential for for an unknown disadvantage.

My inclination would be to exclude games with any randomness,

Games with customizable setups, like Arimaa would count though?  I
personally would have an alternative to Chess 960 as standard chess.
This being players alternate turns configuring their back row, placing
one piece at a time, back and forth, instead of Fischer Random chess.
Castling is abolished.

Yes and no.  Yes it has more replayability since you don't have a
catalog of opening plays.  But no that has no impact on the depth of a
game.

When you have a wider range of openings, the end result here is that
it is a deeper game.

There is the fairness issue with variable set ups, like in Fischer's
Random Chess.  As a solution to that, I would argue that IAGO would
need to have players play both black and white.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't like that at all.  You're essentially altering a game by
making it be played twice.  For one thing you're doubling the
duration.  For another thing if there's no possibility of a tie in a
particular game, now by converting it into a double played version of
itself there is the possibility of a tie.

A game should be judged on its own merits, not on the merits of a
doubled conversion of itself.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You end up doing a series of games tournament style anyhow, you just
have players play both sides.  You also add criterion, such as winning
in a set number of turns and so on.  In a case, for example, where the
sides are NOT balanced (Tablut family), what do you suggest be done to
make it fair?  Only way is to have players play both sides.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Again, no.  A game should be judged on its own merits, not on an
augmented version of itself which now includes a bidding system.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Judged on its own merits?  We are talking about a meta-system to make
sure unknown and uncertain configurations end up being fair for a
tournament structure.  A game doesn't need to be perfectly balanced in
order to be playable in tournaments or even be considered a good
abstract strategy game.  And it certainly doesn't mean a game is
excluded from IAGO because it isn't balanced.  There is no uni-sided
escape game that is perfectly balanced that I know of, and I believe
it has been shown mathematically that you can have a perfectly
balanced game with uneven force strength.  To say now these games get
excluded, is to totally miss a range of abstract strategy games.

More bull crap.  Just judge a game on its own merits, not on a bull
crap conversion of itself, especially one which requires the
memorization of a complex initial setup which must be replayed a
second time.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If the game is done electronically, it isn't memorized by people.  The
people end up doing it.  And what the heck is this "judge the game on
its own merits"?  A game can be acceptable and unbalanced, if people
play both sides of a game.  This is a natural way to handle unbalanced
games.
