I instead got a 2x2x2 so that I could understand that one first.  I
worked out a few algorithms, and now am missing one vital one.  I can
solve it every time to the point where there are only 2 adjacent cubes
which need to be swapped.  I have various different ways to do this
and rather enjoyed the discovery process. It's such a nice puzzle that
I feel it's a shame that people just memorize methods without diving
in themselves.

The work around I use is to mess it up and solve it to that point
until it coincidentally doesn't need the algorithm that I didn't
manage to work out.  I got bored of it after some time, but I imagine
I'll pick one back up and maybe work out the last part if someone else
I know raises an interest in it.

I'm rather new to abstract appreciation and newer even to design, but
I imagine there are some parallels here.
