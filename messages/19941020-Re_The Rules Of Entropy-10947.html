I think that the second wording is not the same as the other tow,
and that the third is the clearest of the lot.

Perhaps the following will be clearer:

2. If one or more of your pawns are not adjacent to any other pawns (including
each other), then you must move a pwns to a spot adjacent to all such pawns
if possible, or pass if not.

2b. If you have a legal move you must make a legal move.

I suspect that making legal movement mandatory is the better option, as the
"never move" strategy could be used to force a draw from a large number of
situations, including the first non-move.

 I think this is likely to be common.  So it should probably be a win
for the last player to move.

Agreed.

Here I feel very strongly it should be a draw.  I don't think this will 
be easy enough to achieve to destroy the game ... it might even add to it
(ala perpetual check).

I like the idea of reducing draws in any game, but I think
that a player whose opponent has an unclearable check can force a draw
without making his own unclearable check, so this rule looks too complicated
for such a simple game.
