On the box it said "This game is for adults", although there was no sexual
content. I am not sure what I would think if I visited an
adult friend and they said "lets play noughts and crosses"..... and then
pulled out an expensive brushed steel set.

This game is based on a pun in the an ancient aromatic language in which
"putting down a bear" means the same as taking off an item of clothing, and
"taking the bull" means the same as "drinking a double".   The adults in
question thus take it in turns in each game (which as you know even for the
greatest strategist doesn't take very long) in getting drunk or getting
naked.   No doubt many times adults have said to you "let's have a game of
noughts and crosses" and you have missed the inuendo and suggested a fine
themed strategic game instead.

And I guess some people may think there are no better ways of spending ï¿½20
as a means of facilitating these lewd goals - a deficit of  imagination
perhaps.
