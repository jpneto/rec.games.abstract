Hello,


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Furthermore, you may need to account for what we
usually mean by 'variants' - an admittedly large
and fuzzy concept of family of games centred on
a given game. How would you call them? 'distant
cousins'? 'relatives'? 'historical or feel-related
derivations'?

It would be much clearer to keep using 'variants'
in the usual meaning
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As you stated, this is a fuzzy concept, so there can be no "usual"
meaning. Everybody means something different when s/he is saying
"variant".


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
and come with a new term for
'games in the same goal-oriented class', if you
ever need such a short term instead of speaking of
classes. I suggest something like 'goal variants'
or 'goal-alike variants'
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can do that, but i think, it would unnecessarily complicate the issue!
It is sufficient (and common scientific practice) to use the old term after
you gave a (working) definition that explains your usage of the term.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In other words, using only 'variants' in your
specific meaning strikes me as another centered
view, typical of authoritarian minds rather than of
scientific minds, while you don't want your work to
be a religion.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You are impertinent. An far-fetched imputation! BTW I stated several
times that this is not the only possible way to construct a classification
system of abstract board games.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
How do you see the gist, the essence of a game's
goal? Through the most-accepted description of the
rules? Sometimes through the majority's feeling,
as you say "according to most Go players [Gess] is
definitely not a Go variant"?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Gess has in common with Go that it is played with Go stones on a Go board.
I can play Draughts with Go stones on a Go board. Obviously this is not
sufficient to make a game a Go variant.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Logically, current Chess is as well about stifling
your opponent, preventing her to move - slightly
complicated with stalemates of course, which you
could put aside as a minor goal. Threats to
capture the king may only be the means. How
science decides?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


If you don't listen, any discussion is a waste of time. I stated clearly
that I meant FINAL goals. Take your French-English dictionary and try to
find the letter "f".

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Go is no less a pure game of capture than a pure
game of territory, isn't it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


You don't understand Go.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What is the main goal of Tanbo? Survival? Captures?
Stifling as Chess? AFAC, I cannot decide.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is making territory.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Logically, Phutball may be seen as a game of
connection as well.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You have no understanding of logic.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Is trax made of two concurrent goals?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
We could put Trax in the single class of
pattern games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, but we must create subcategories, otherwise too many games would be
included into the same category. As I stated in another post, Trax is a
hybrid game with two equally important final goals.

You whole post smacks of autism. I am not going to respond to any post
again that distorts my statements by deliberately ommiting parts of it.
