Let alone a holy grail.

Regarding finitude, soft finite games are finite, and the mere
existence of cycles does not necessarily make a game infinite.

'Soft finite' means that the opponents <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> cooperate to prolongue
cycles ad infinitum. That means that both must <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>strive<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> for a draw.
That would make the 'game' they play a non zero-sum game: it's solving
a puzzle together, it's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> playing a game.

In other words, 'finitude' in Volo and in several other games is
object related.

Arguing that a soft finite game is 'infinite' and needs to be
remedied, is presuming that, even if at least one player will always
get in a position to win, the game needs to be forced into a
decision.
That's presuming that players are stupid.

As a footnote: Chess isn't finite at all. One can argue that Chess is
a bad game. That's a matter of opinion. One can't argue that millions
think otherwise.
