I thought those who read games-orientated ucam groups but not cam.misc
might be interested in the following.  (I will be running the Othello,

MSO Cambridge

On the weekend of 5/6 May, there is a games tournament called MSO 
Cambridge taking place in the University Centre.

There are tournaments of Chess, Scrabble, Go and Othello and various other 
games. Included is the UK championship of Shogi (Japanese Chess) with 3 
professional players in attendance, and 1st prize a trip to New York.

Specially for novices or anyone who would like to try out games they have 
not played before, there are four half-day tournaments of less-well known 
games where we expect everyone playing will be near beginner standard. 
These are fascinating traditional games from other parts of the world.

There is a "learn and play" session in the Bowett Room, Queens' College at 
7.30pm Thursday 26/4 where you can try out different games before the event.

Entry fees are up to �12 (�7 for unwaged etc.) for the full 2 days, with 
reduced fees for those entering just one or two competitions.
