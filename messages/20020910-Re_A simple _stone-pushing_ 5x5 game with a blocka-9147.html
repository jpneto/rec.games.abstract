where here, _ means the square is empty. At any stage during the game,
only one stone can occupy any given square and there are no captures
or introduction of new stones. During each turn by black, he has to
move one of his black stones to a empty square adjacent to it (only
orthogonally, not diagonally) and similarly for white. If one of the
players run out of legal moves, that means he has lost. Otherwise,
once it becomes obvious the game would simply continue forever (in
practice, we could impose the rather artificial rule that if the game
doesn't end after let's say 200 moves, it's a draw), it's declared a
draw. From the initial setup, black moves first.

At first glance, this game looks rather trivial, and it looks as if
there ought to be a simple strategy to draw no matter what the
opponent does or for one side to force a win, but after playing a few
games with it and analyzing it a bit, it definitely seems more
complicated than that. Of course, maybe I'm just being stupid and one
of you can come up with a simple strategy or simple analysis of this
game which would leave me wondering why I didn't think of it earlier
in hindsight.

White imagines covering the nonempty squares by a set of dominos, each 
containing one black and one white stone.  When black moves a stone out 
of its domino, white moves the other stone from the same domino so that 
the two moved stones can again be covered by a domino.  In this way, 
white can avoid ever running out of moves.

So it's either a draw or a second player win...
