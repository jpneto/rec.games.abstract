This game is played on a 5x5 square board with 12 black and 12 white
stones initially arranged like this:

_ B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W
where here, _ means the square is empty. At any stage during the game,
only one stone can occupy any given square and there are no captures
or introduction of new stones. During each turn by black, he has to
move one of his black stones to a empty square adjacent to it (only
orthogonally, not diagonally) and similarly for white. If one of the
players run out of legal moves, that means he has lost. Otherwise,
once it becomes obvious the game would simply continue forever (in
practice, we could impose the rather artificial rule that if the game
doesn't end after let's say 200 moves, it's a draw), it's declared a
draw. From the initial setup, black moves first.
