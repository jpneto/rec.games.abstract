I own the following book about Chinese chess.  I have never played the
game and I have only skimmed the book, so don't ask me any questions
about either   :-)

title:  Let's play Chinese Chess
author: B. Constantino
isbn: 962 211 018 5 (paper)
copyright: first edition 1979, revised edition 1988
publisher: Book Marketing Ltd.
           North Point Industrial Building
           499 King's Road, 17/F., Flat A,
           North Point, Hong Kong
co-publisher: Kelly &amp; Walsh Ltd.  (What the heck is a co-publisher?)
pages: 88
price:  I paid $HK 28 for it.  (I think that's about $US 4.)

On the back cover appears the following.  In general, I think that stuff
on the back of books should be taken with a grain of salt.  Not having read
this particular book, I don't know how honest these comments are.  Still, it
gives a good idea as to how the marketers want the book to be seen.

    This guide gives you a
    good knowledge of the
    game

    The author has compiled
    in note form a primer
    that can easily be
    followed by anyone who
    plays the international
    version of the game
