Hear, hear.  Count me among those who think these accusations of poor 
sportsmanship are way out of line.  I wouldn't even have commented on the 
matter, but the Chinook team should know that we aren't all ignorant.

I would like to make a couple of comments regarding the poor-sportsmanship
issue. First off, I was one who yelled "foul" upon first hearing that
Chinook had been granted the title after Tinsley's resignation. While
I have since read J. Schaefer's (sp?) explanation of the circumstances
and changed my position on this issue (i.e. I now believe that there
was no poor sportsmanship involved and I plead guilty to jumping the
gun) I don't think the trend I see above is justified. Namely,
the folks who don't agree with those of you/us who think that accepting the
resignation is not poor sportsmanship, need not be called  "idiots" or
"ignorant". I've never quite understood the need to resort to personal insults
merely because you disagree with someone's opinion. I do believe that I was
guilty of reaching an opinion without full knowledge of the facts - perhaps
that is indeed ignorant, but the label "ignorant" typically carries a
more derogatory feel when hurled as an insult. 

If you think, as I now do, that everything in the Tinsley-Chinook
match was above the board then say so without issuing ad hominem
attacks ... Just my 2 cents...
