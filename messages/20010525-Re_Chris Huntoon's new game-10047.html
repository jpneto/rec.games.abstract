Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You probably know that I have included Tourney in my book project (i just
finished my first proofreading). I would include Gorgon, if compulsory
"petrifying" would be an acceptable variant to you.
----------------------------------
So you'll include this other game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> if you're allowed to dictate rules
to the author?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Glenn you would serve well as a propaganda minister! I am not
going to dictate anybody anything. But I will also not let somebody else
dictate me which games I include. I have more than enough games described
in my book project, so I don't need to add another one.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Chris, judging from this guy's past behavior on Usenet, (Check for yourself
on Deja) I wouldn't give him permission to include <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>anything<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> without final
editorial approval attached as a condition.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, you ought to be ashamed for your disgusting behavior. BTW, I have
nothing against Chris reading my chapter about Tourney, but it is in
German.


Ralf
