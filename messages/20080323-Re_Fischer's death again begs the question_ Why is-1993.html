<br>Yes and none of them have the property that they can only be fully

<br>Many sports organise their major competitions as KO events, which

<br>Why would you expect chess tournaments to be different?&nbsp; If you've

<br>if on the 11th, with nothing at stake, you don't want to take it

<br>No, he isn't.&nbsp; There is often nothing to play for in the last round or
<br>two of a round-robin tournament (or `league' as they're called in most
<br>sports).&nbsp; The team that always wins has an unassailable position at
<br>the top of the table; the crap team that always loses has an
<br>irretrievable position at the bottom of the table.&nbsp; All that's to play
<br>for is the occasional minor distinction in the middle of the table.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Chess tournaments almost never end this way. There are usually people
<br>grouped near the top.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>In chess, it is the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>leaders who have everything to play for<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> who
<br>play the 15 move draws.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Players who have a chance of winning the tournament generally attempt
<br>to do so in the last round.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>No. They usually make no attempt to win.&nbsp; They take short draws to
<br>lock-in a guaranteed prize.
<br>
<br>Here is an example. After the penultimate round of the 2007 World Open,
<br>a Swiss, there was one player with 5 points and 4 tied at 4.5. The prize
<br>fund for place finish was (approximately) 6000, 3000, 1667, 750, 450 and around
<br>2200 for the next 10 places. The last round pairings had the player with 5
<br>paired with a player with 4.5, two players with 4.5 paired together, and the
<br>remaining player with 4.5&nbsp; points paired with somebody in the 4.0
<br>group.
<br>
<br>Consider the last round game between the two well-known GMs
<br>with 4.5. It went:
<br>1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 a5
<br>7. O-O O-O 8. Nc3 Ne4 Draw agreed. Exciting chess, Mr. Richerby?
<br>
<br>It's interesting to address the financial incentives the players faced
<br>before the game. Both players ended up finishing in a 6-way tie for 2nd through
<br>7th place and won aout $1100. What would their prizes have been if their game 
had been
<br>decisive? The winner would have finished in a two way tie for 1st and 2nd, worth
<br>$4500. The loser would have won $200+
<br>
<br>Of course, there were other possible scenarios, yielding different monetary 
returns,
<br>but the most likely scenario occurred. (The 4.5 player beat the 5.0 player, 
outrating him by over
<br>200 points, and the other 4.5 player drew.) The least beneficial outcome that a
<br>winner of the game between the 4.5s would have faced was a two-way tie
<br>for 2nd and 3rd, or $2333. In most scenarios they would fiinish in a two or
<br>three way tie for the top prizes.
<br>
<br>The first thing worth noting is that he players did <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>NOT<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> reach their "drawn"
<br>position and then flip a coin to decide who should lose on purpose. Nor did they
<br>prearrange for one to lose and split the prize fund. Even though those actions
<br>would have doubled their collective prize! Simple reality is that chess
<br>as played with the current scoring is not zero sum, and cheating opportunities
<br>abound.
<br>
<br>The mystery, of course, is why the players colluded not to play,
<br>even when it was against their collective self-interest. Why was working for
<br>a shot at $4000 a worse choice than getting $900 with no work or risk.
<br>Is it because chess has a draw culture that is so pervasive? Perhaps
<br>the notion of contesting a last round game was simply out of their
<br>experience, something that they were unable to deal with psychologically.
