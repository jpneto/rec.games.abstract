Announcing the first ever .....

		**** INTERNET OTHELLO/REVERSI COMPETITION ****

The tournament will be held on the new Internet Othello Server, so if you're
not already registered there, do it now!

Just type:	telnet faust.uni-paderborn.de 5000

And explore!  "help tournament" gives some details about the tournament,
including how to register.  Game times will be arranged between players,
to facilitate contestants from time zones around the world.  The first
round will begin around March 10th, with subsequent rounds being played
at a reasonable pace.  Time controls are 30 minutes per player per game.

Note that this tournament is open to computer programs as well as human
players.  Since the event will be Swiss-style, players will tend to play
games against players of similar ability.  Currently there are a wide
range of players on the IOS, ranging from absolute beginners to former
World Champions and some of the best computer programs written.

If you'd rather not compete, you're still welcome to visit the IOS for
casual games, or to watch others play.  The people there are friendly
and you're bound to enjoy yourself!

Hope to see you soon on the IOS ...
