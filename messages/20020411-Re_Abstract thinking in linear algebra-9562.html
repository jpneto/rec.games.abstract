Actually, my text has quite a bit of proof in it and my professors,
both calculus and linear algebra, teach proof during class, as well as
perform very difficult problems so we can see the techniques.  In
linear algebra we're required to prove things both in graded homework
and on tests.

Same here.  Our lecturers have always proved theorums whenever possible.
The only problem is that they expected us to have a basic knowlege of set
theory and logic from our schooling, which doesn't seem to be the case for
many Scots.  When I left school I had almost no knowlege of set theory, even
though all the books used it.  The problem was that although the books said
stuff like x &lt;- {1,2,3} they didn't tell us what &lt;- or {...} meant and
neither did our teachers.  With practise and a little imagination it's
possible to work our roughly what they mean, but if ppl need to use it in
maths class every day then they should teach it to them!!!

But I'm frustrated because I don't like the rush.  I never have time
to consider what all this means, what he applications are, what the
implications are... it's rush off to the next problem set and memorize
the next problem solving technique.  I'm getting intellectual boredom
just from having to develop the next bunch of pointless techniques.
The more abstract classes are even worse.  I just can't imagine taking
3 months to learn analysis.  It seems ridiculously short.  People have
devoted their lifetimes to the study.  I'm not even going to scratch
the surface in 3 months.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly!  It's been 4 months since I took our first analysis module (logic
and proof, real numbers, sequences and series) I'm only now beginning to
understand it, but now we've sat the exam for that module and are onto the
next (continuity, differentiation, integration and power series).  I learn a
bunch of concepts, and repeat them in the exam with little understanding of
what they mean.  Only now is it becoming clear.  For example, the (now) easy
examples like

E &gt; 0 is given, find d &gt; 0 st the implication is valid:

e.g. |x-3| &lt; d =&gt; |x^2 - 9| &lt; E

is so much easier now I understand the purpose of epsilon and delta (luckily
in this case it became apparent just before the exam).  Before it was just a
case of doing what they did and assume it'll all work out.  That's not
learning, it's copying!

I'm sure it's obvious that I'm burning out... It's just that I love
math, and thinking, and reason, but not the pell mell rush toward half
assed understanding, then being given the stamp of approval because
you can pretend you know well enough to pass.   It's harsh criticism,
but at the moment it seems like a macabre play act to me.

Sadly, this seems to be norm.

3.  Why should professors have to teach at breakneck speed and
practically not have time to answer questions in class?  Shouldn't a
math class take at least 2-3 hours to allow for discussion,
reflection, thought, etc?  My professors constantly have to snub
questions, or cut corners, because they simply don't have time to get
into it.  Asking for explanation during office hours is a necessary
ritual.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Most ppl would run a mile from two/three hour maths lecturers, but I'd
certainly welcome a two hour lecture every two week days per subject
(particularly for analysis), instead of a one hour lecture twice a week per
subject.  I always notice a big difference from computer science to maths.
Computing science not an easier subject than maths, in the sense that the
concepts aren't as difficult, there are just fewer of them giving lecturers
more time to interact with the class, benefiting all students.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.  Professors who yell or belittle students in class or out of it
should simply not be allowed to teach.  They might think they're
performing "tough love" but in reality they're destroying the one
thing that makes math possible: faith in ones self.  Math is hard
enough without having to deal with the schoolyard-level egos of some
professors too.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


No argument here!  One or two lecturers at our uni were on a collision
course for casualty if I'd caught up with them (one even pronounced to the
class he hated teaching ppl and that he'd rather be doing 'research'.  His
resentment was plainly obvious for the two lectures I attended!).


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think I'm experiencing many of the downsides to the current system.
But I don't see a way out of it for me.. other than to accept the
reality and move on into the applied math world... ( numerical
analysis and engineering..).. and teach myself real math on my own
time in a more suitable environment for thinking.

Incidentally, I've placed a few quiet questions in the department and
have a couple of professor's assurance that I could occasionally ask
for a bit of help on the confusing matters.  I cannot tell you how
immensely relieved I am for that.  I hope that others who feel as I do
will find their own creative way to deal with the situation.

Hope all goes well,
