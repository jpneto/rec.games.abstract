Does it mean that, when not capturing, a captain must stop on a
hexagon where it can be captured (i.e. with an empty cell behind it or
behind the line of men it belongs to)? I guess it doesn't mean that,
in part from the triangle position you pointed out, but if it does,
and stalemate is a loss (or a win :-) ), then Pommel is, neddless to
say, categorically drawless.

If a captain, when not capturing, is only obliged to end its move in
line of sight of an oppossing captain, then I can imagine some drawn
positions on a hexhex board, but I can't be sure about your standard
square-hex boards. The simplest draw on a hexhex involves two pairs of
oppossing captains placed on corner cells, with no more pieces on the
board. The captains can move forever from one corner cell to another,
always in line of sight of the enemy, but never in danger of capture.

On the other hand, according to the above-quoted rule, captains must
stop in hexagons where they can "see" any oppossing piece, soldier or
captain. If that's so, many trivial draws are possible. Imagine a
position where each player has one captain on any square and one
soldier on a corner cell. Players could move their respective captains
always in line of sight of the oppossing soldier, but never actually
capturing it. Am I right?

This looks like an unnecessary restriction to me. Captains are already
very open to attack with the Mad Bishops rule. Why add another rule to
demote them further?

Meanwhile, linear capture makes for a very attacking game, doesn't it?
The games must be real slaughters (and great fun).
