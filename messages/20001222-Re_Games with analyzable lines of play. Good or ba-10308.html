So would I!  Indeed, the only "exact" games of bridge can be those done
with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>no<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> communication between opponents, or between partners, except
as made by bids and play of cards.  No declarations of bidding or playing
conventions whatsoever.  Naturally, the individual players would have to
be playing in booths so no visual/aural clues were available.  There would
also have to be no clues from time delays to make bids/plays.  So all three
players' times would have to be individually unobservable by the other,
(and a small random time delay thrown in now and then would probably help!

I am given to understand that this is exactly how high-level
tournaments work.
