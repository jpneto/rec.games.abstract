Nick, you were right.  The rich-get-richer phenomenon started to
manifest itself after several days of play testing.  I switched back
to the Min-showing version and the transformation from unstable to
stable was remarkable.  Good call.  If only there were more like you
here and less of the lemma quoting bore mongers.  I have to ask
though, are we ever going to see an equal goals game from you?

I saw a Liger on TV the other day and I couldn't believe my eyes.  It
was huge!  That's what I want to convey about this game, hence the
name change.
