In Japanese rules [for Go], it used to be that there was a rule specifically
saying that a bent four rule was always dead.  Occasionally, someone
would find an obscure position having similar properties to "bent four",
and bring it to the attention of the authorities;  who would consider
it, and eventually make a special ruling on it.  Japanese players seemed
happy enough with this state of affairs, but western players (who
generally used Japanese rules) did not like a rule book that included a
lengthening list of special cases.  In 1982 the Japanese authorities
produced a new rule book, which instead included an algorithm for
establishing whether such special positions were alive or dead.

Well, it does take only a minute to learn how to play - the only part

figuring out who won after the game is over.

I express the same sentiment you did on my page about Go at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.quadibloc.com/other/bo01.htm">http://www.quadibloc.com/other/bo01.htm</a>

but, in fairness, there <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a solution. If people are going to sell
Go boards with a sheet of rules in the package next to Chess,
Checkers, and Backgammon in the stores... they just need to include
the Tromp-Taylor counting rules on the instruction sheet. Those are
simple, unambiguous, and easy to understand. Then, an additional
paragraph could note there are other counting rules in more common use
that are more subtle.
