OK, I've read net resources, and Othello seems to turn out to be an
interesting game. I run into an advice that one should not take edges
too early. Why is it so?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In my experience, it's not so much that the
edges are vulnerable, but that the central
portions of the edges that leave openings.
I will generally only target the following
positions on the edges: 1,3; 1,6; 3,1; 3,8;
6,1; 6,8; 8,3; 8,6.  These squares seem to
have the best offense for strikes at the
corners and allow for best defense along
the sides.

The only times that I've had this fail is
when the other player makes a play for the
other critical point along the same row or
column, but the best way to fight then is
to take the battle to another side or
corner until the side can be consolidated
or the opponent can be forced to fill in
the intervening squares.

My best tactics when not directly taking a
side position revolve around either (a),
using infiltrative outflanking to leave a
piece of mine in a central position where
it would be difficult to recapture (without
creating vulnerabilities in the opponent's
position) or (b), drawing my opponent to
make placements on a second/seventh row/
column.  Three and six are the most useful
numbers in this game--two and seven lead to
vulnerability, in general.
