Inspired by the discussions under the thread "Nim game" the following
game occurred to me:

2D Nim

Two players (A and B) compete. Player B puts down a number of square
pieces in a configuration such that all pieces touch one other along
at least one edge. Player A either accepts or rejects the start. In
the latter case player B has to start. In turns each player takes away
one or more pieces. More pieces can be taken only when they are
located in a (horizontal or vertical) row and all touch each other.
The player who makes the last move wins.


Example game:

Alice and Bob compete. Bob puts down a configuration consisting of 15
pieces:

  XXX
 X X 
XXXXX
 X XX
   XX

Alison accepts the start and removes one piece:

  XXX
 X X 
XXX X
 X XX
   XX

Bob now removes the top row:

 X X 
XXX X
 X XX
   XX

Alison responds by again moving one piece:

 X X 
X X X
 X XX
   XX

Bob removes the bottom row:

 X X 
X X X
 X XX

and Alison removes the rightmost column leaving an even number of
isolated pieces:

 X X
X X 
 X X

Bob gives up.


Note that this game contains regular (1D) Nim as special case. For
example, a configuration like:

 XXXXX
X
X    X
 XXXX

is equivalent to a Nim game with four heaps of size 5, 4, 2 and 1.


Of course, the Sprague-Grundy theory applies to this impartial game.
Configurations can be given Grundy numbers that effectively map the
game onto regular Nim. A configuration consisting of N pieces can not
have a Grundy number larger than N. Some example configurations with
their Grundy numbers are:

X 1     XX 2   XXX 3     XX 3
                         X

XXXX 4   XXX 4   XXX 2    XX 1   XX 0
         X        X      XX      XX

 X      XX      X      X
XXX 3   XXX 1  XXXX 5  XXXX 5  XXXXX 5
 X

The Grundy number of a configuration that consists of several
independent subgroups is given by the Nim-sum of the Grundy numbers of
the subgroups.
For example, in the above example game Alison's first move leaves a
configuration consisting of three subgroups of size 5, 5 and 4. These
subgroups have Grundy numbers 3, 2 and 1. Using Nim addition these
numbers add up to zero, demonstrating that Alison created a winning
position in the first move.
