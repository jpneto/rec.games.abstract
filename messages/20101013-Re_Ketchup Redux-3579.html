I seriously doubt that Ketchup is now suddenly a "finely balanced
game".

When a game is fundamentally fucked, just dump it.  Don't turn it into
an endless tweakfest.  There was a lot of interest in my game Liger,
but I had to withdraw it.  With enough experience, it's an automatic
first player win.  A magazine editor inquired about Liger and I had to
firmly denounce the game.  [As fortune would have it, I had designed
Flume the evening before, so I had something to offer the editor.] I
had to ask Aaron to take Liger off SuperDuperGames, which he has
promised to do.

Cut your losses and move on.
