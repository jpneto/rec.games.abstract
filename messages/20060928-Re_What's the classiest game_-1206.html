It's not just you, Patrick.  Abstracts are royalty among games.
Checkers, Chess, and Go are all magnificent achievements for their
simplicity and fundamental uniqueness.  Checkers especially has
probably been more imitated than any other game.

Backgammon is a great game, but I guess I have to go along with the
pack that its randomness does make it a lesser game.

A limited degree of randomness is fine with me, as it prevents
"scripted" games, where players just follow moves that someone much
smarter than them decided were optimal.  But I agree that randomness
will lower a games "classiness" in most people's view.

Perhaps, the best compromise is a randomized set-up with deterministic
play afterwards, with the "cake slice" rule applied to the first two
turns to reduce any advantage the randomness may give one side.

Modern games that have awed me can be counted on one hand: Reversi,
Hex, Y, Fire and Ice, Dots and Boxes, and Sprouts.  (Ok, two hands.)

While I haven't played it much, Trax has impressed me by its
simplicity and depth.

Abstract games are like diamonds.  The exquisite ones are exceedingly

Sturgeon's law applies to a lot of categories, abstract games being
only one among many.  Though I will agree that making a good simple
game is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>much<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> harder than making a good complex game.
