hello anyone,

 as there is some talk about Chinese Chess (Xianqi), I wonder, whether there
are still more Chess variants - I only know Shogi and Xianqi as real chess 
variants, but I recently heard about "Korean Chess" - does such a variant 
truly exist or is it only another style of playing Chess (or Xianqi, Shogi) 
itself?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There are three "families" of chess.  Represented by examples, they are:

 o  Western Chess 
 o  Shogi
 o  Xianqi 

Each family has several examples.  "Korean Chess" is an example of the
Xianqi type.  Each game in the family shares certain characteristics with
the others (general look of the board, types of pieces, etc.)

What they generally have in common is a king, a rook type piece, a
knight, pawns that promote, a piece that moves diagnally (the guards
and elephants of Xianqi, the bishop and generals of Shogi, the queen
and bishops of Western Chess) either one space or many.  The diagnal
moving pieces mutated the most.  The rooks mutated into lances in
Shogi (I've heard the Shogi bishop and rook were recent Western Chess
add-ons to Shogi).  The guards/ elephants/generals mutated into the
bishop and queen in Western Chess.  The knight stayed pretty constant
although specific rules vary (the knight is limited in Shogi to
forward moves and can jump pieces in Western Chess).  Then there is
the cannon.

As an aside, a friend an I once created "Fuzzy Chess" using all 3
types of pieces on a Shogi board.  It looked pretty neat.  The two
stage pawns (they split -- stack a Western Chess pawn on a Chinese
Chess pawn) were kind of interesting. :-)

Also - I once asked for a rules on Xianqi, I got some, but there was no 
description of the move notation for the game. I now saw some games postings 
with a form of notation, that I seemingly didn't quite understand - perhabs 
someone can mail me another rules text that includes a description of the 
notation. (Currently I play Xianqi with a guy in "Vervan's Gaming Network" 
newsgroup V_CHESS and we use the common chess notation to exchange our moves. 
But - if these aren't the right form of notation, we want to switch over to 
the right ones then (just to learn a bit more about Xianqi).

The "official" notation is "relative" to the piece.  A lot of poeple
don't like it.  Get the book sold by Ishi Press in the US (they deal
primarily in Go but sell Shogi and Xianqi books and sets as well).  If
you don't know how to get in touch with them, let me know and I will
provide an address.  Their "Chinese Chess" book also includes a good
general history of all chess games including Tai-Chess (played with
little pagodas...) with enough info to play most of them.  It also has
a good basic strategy primer for Xianqi.
