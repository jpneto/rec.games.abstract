This version is a significant improvement compared to the older versions =

Obviously that depends on how many of the other points on the plance are

I believe you refer to Go Moku, not Go. They are both played on a Go board but
only Go Moku is an x-in-a-row game.

X-in-a-row games where x is also the length of a dimension get more drawish as
x increases, but less drawish as the number of dimensions increase. These games
are also much more drawish when x is even. For games that are 'balanced' (in
that it is trivial nether for the first person to win nor for the second person
to draw) will generally have the second player playing defensively for the
whole game.

OTOH, games like Go Moku, where the length of a dimension (19) greatly exceed x
(5) allow for more ebb and flow, given the limits of human calculation.

By increasing the number of levels to five, the game takes on a =

to make this center space a 'free-space', much like bingo ended up =

I suspect this game is a draw, because 4x4x4 is reasonably balanced and
increasing x should make defense easier. On think I like about your game is
that you've made x effective halfway between even and odd. By making the center
point off limits you've made the diagonal and center planes even harder to win
on then if they were even, but the other planes remain odd.

I do not believe there is a first-move-win with this variation, since in =
effect both players are making the first move, and since neither can win =
outright without exclusive control of the center.  The game becomes a =
battle for the other critical strategy spaces, and a lot of the action =
is performed on the OUTSIDE spaces of the cube, instead of on the inside =
like a 4x4x4 version.

In a 4x4x4 board (Quibic) the middle points are mathematically equivalent to
the corners. The board may be turned inside-out and all tactics remain the
same.
