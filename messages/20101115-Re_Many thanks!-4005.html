Yes, quite, one might even ask how much anyone cares about anything at

Christian that's the thing, they're all game related at RGC (besides

Indeed, but barring those the last post was November 12. That was my
post regarding the post about Sygo that you mirrored, and it starts
with "What did I tell you, nobody cares" ...

As said, nobody seems to be able to present anything worth posting
about. There is just a lot of polite, civil silence.
And I don't see what, if anything, that has to do with my departure.
It just makes me wonder why people become members, if not to
participate in what the group is set out to be.
