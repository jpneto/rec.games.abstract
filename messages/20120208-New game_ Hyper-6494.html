HYPER
======

Hyper is a dynamic goals connection game for two players: Black and
White. It can be played on a board of any size and tesselation. A
base-7 hexhex board seems like a good choice.

The rules of Hyper are closely related to Yodd, but gameplay should be
very different.

DEFINITIONS

A group is a set of like-colored, adjacent stones.
A hyper-group is a set of adjacent stones of any color (black, white
or both).

PLAY

The board starts out empty. Starting with Black, the players take
turns placing one or two stones of any color on empty cells. On his
first turn, Black can only place one stone.

At the end of a turn, there must be an odd number of hyper-groups on
the board, and an odd number of groups in every hyper-group.

Players can pass their turn at any moment, unless it violates the
previous rule (this means Black can't pass on his first turn).

When both players pass in succession, whoever owns the most hyper-
groups wins. A hyper-group is owned by the player with most groups of
his color in it.

I haven't actually played this game yet. It may be great or broken, I
don't know.
