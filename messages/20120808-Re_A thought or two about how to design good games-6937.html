I think this is an overstatement. A lot of things are not trivially easy to visualize, but can become instant with familiarity, with the end result that after an initial hump, the question "is this legal" ceases to matter. Knight moves in chess are a good example, and an extension of that even the Chinese Knight (which can be blocked by two intervening pieces, but not by one) is not trivial but is "easy enough" to not hurt clarity too much.

Does such a hump count against a game, in your opinion?
