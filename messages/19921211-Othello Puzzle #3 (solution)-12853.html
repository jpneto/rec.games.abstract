Black (x) to play and win decisively ...


This puzzle seemed to generate a little more interest this time, so I'll
take that as a vote of confidence and continue posting puzzles from
time to time.  See Othello Puzzle #4 later ...

While Aida may see that a6 is a win in 8 seconds, humans don't have that
ability.  However, with careful play this position can be converted into
one which is absolutely unassailable.

The solution I had in mind (and which I consider to be the optimal move)
is g7, as posted earlier.  The point is that white is dead if (s)he takes
the h8 corner, and even worse off if (s)he avoids it.

In the actual game, play went: g7 h8 h7 b7 a6 a7 a8 b8 g8 ... and black
has a devastating position.  Note that it is probably incorrect to
respond to h8 with g8, since a move to b7 for white then assures much
of the bottom edge after black eventually is forced to take a8.  Black
should win, but by a smaller margin.

I'm not as keen on a6 as black's move, since then after a white a7, black
either has to continue with g7 as before (in which case a white move to
b7 forces black to open up the top of the board and give white good moves)
or elsewhere immediately giving white moves.  I don't doubt that a6 is
winning, but my hunch is that g7 leads to a larger win.

If you're unsure as to why any variation works well for black, please
let me know and I'll expend my sequences to clarify things.
