In response to the initial premise, I'll admit
that while I can't claim to have played any
piece-placement games skillfully, it does seem
that black has an advantage in these games,
because of the balancing mechanism in question.
Basically, it feels to me as if Black has a move
in hand, and loses far less from exercising his
option early as compared to White, because he
still gets a growth step.

Basically, it seems that White's window of
success on growth-starting is much smaller than
Black's, while Black also has the minor advantage
of being able to be in a reactionary position in
the early placement stage (assuming Black
exercises the limits on the growth-starting
window in order to gain the first move on White
as well)

WHOA!!  Sconibulus seems to be... No!  It can't be!!  He's "ARGUING ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER"!!!!

Looks like reality has taken the form of Sconibulus, Christian.  Don't look
now, but he's NIPPING AT YOUR HEELS!!  How's that "escape" working out for
you? lol

That's an interesting question to which I have no
immediate answer.
...
I'll ponder your remarks carefully. I don't know
if you have a point, but that may very well be.
I'll have to sleep on it.
