I haven't put a huge amount of thought into this, but I don't think
Ecalper would be as complex as Oust on the same size board.  In
Ecalper, you can move and flip wherever you want, unlike Oust with its
move restrictions.  However, you're limited to 127 stone placements
and a third as many flips in Ecalper.  In Oust, because of stone
recycling, cooperating players could keep a game going for hundreds if
not thousands of moves on a 127 cell board, the game tree fucking
flaring the whole way along.  Just a theory....

I didn't put that table for competing with other games. I did it just
for explaining Ecalper is a deep game, also with just 127 stones.

The reason why it has a so big game-tree complexity is because Ecalper
is (more or less) a three-move game.

I didn't study the game-tree complexity of Oust, so it's difficult to
say something relevant here, but, anyway, you should consider the
average number of moves for estimating the game-tree complexity.

How many possible moves in Oust does the player have in the second
turn? I think it's 120. In Ecalper, however, during the second turn
player has 930372 possible moves to choose from.

This, to me, is a strong clue Ecalper has a bigger game-tree
complexity than Outs (with a fair and meaningful number of turns).

But it would be really interesting whether someone can find out the
Outs' game-tree complexity.
