When I was in grade school  We played this game called Krypto.  It was
adeck of cards number 1-25.  Each player got five cards and a card was
placed in the middle.  You had to use all 5 of your cards and
addition,subtraction, multiplication and/or division to get the number in
the middle.  I had a set of cards but something happened to them.  Anybody
heard of this game and know where I can get a deck of Krypto cards?

If the only real feature on the cards are the number 1-25 (which is seems
to be), there should be no difficulty in making them yourself. If there are
additional rules that makes it nescessary to have the original deck, I'd like
to hear those, too.
