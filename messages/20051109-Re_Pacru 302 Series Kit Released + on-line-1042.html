We have now got the Shacru software available to play on the net (IE5 
upwards) either side by side or against the AI player. (bottom of page at

Shacru is a simple abstract game for 2,3 or 4 players.

Shacru Rules



Each player is represented by one colour: and they use the pieces and tiles 
of that colour.



The order of play between the different colours is a matter of choice. You 
can decide which player is using which colour, and the order of play, by any 
reasonable means.



Make sure the board has only the two shades of neutral tiles on it arranged 
in diagonal lines across the board.   If there are three or four players in 
the game, then each player has three pieces to start: for the two player 
game each has four.

Take it in turns to move one piece at a time.  You cannot pass on a turn 
unless you cannot move.   If you cannot move any pieces then you simply pass 
on your turn to the end of the game: you may still have won the game if the 
other players cannot get more tiles than you.

You can move any of your pieces one space straight ahead, or at a 45 degree 
angle to the direction it is pointing. After a move, leave the piece 
pointing in the direction you've moved it.

Each time you move a piece you replace the tile you are arriving on with 
your own colour tile.

When you move a piece across a border, you can set it down as normal after 
the move (leaving the piece pointing in the direction you've moved it) or 
choose to twist the piece forty five degrees to the the left or to the right 
as part of your turn.

You may not move onto a tile that is another player's colour.  You may not 
move onto a tile where another piece is sitting



A game ends when there are no players left who can make a move, or the only 
remaining players who can move can only move in such a way that they will 
not be able to acquire any more tiles in the future.   The winner of the 
game is the player with most tiles on the board at the end of the game.   It 
is possible to use the number of tiles on the board of each player as a 
score and then play several games as a set, totalling the score from each 
game.
