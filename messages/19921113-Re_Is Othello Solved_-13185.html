No, but they can look very deeply into the endgame.  Back in the
PDP-11 Version 6 Unix days, I wrote a Reversi program that looked
ahead through the entire (shrinking) endgame tree when there were (I
think) eight vacant squares remaining.  Modern CPUs, and more
sophisticated programming than I was doing, could probably improve
this considerably.  I would hate to play against a computer that knew
the entire game tree with twenty moves left...

Well, as far as I know the record for perfect endgame searches is in
the neighbourhood of 26 empty squares, using a hardware endgame analyzer
written by Clarence Hewlett (editor of the United States Othello Association
newsletter).  However, during the actual play most programs don't search
more than 10 moves ahead, and it's my feeling that the best humans still
possess enough extra knowledge to beat computer programs, although perhaps
the computers would win more often by "tricking" their opponents.  The
advantage one way or the other has never been decisively established.
