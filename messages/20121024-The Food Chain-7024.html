Designers are at the top of the food chain, high above programmers and players.  Try to conduct yourselves with dignity.  Do you have to be a sociopathic instigator like me?  No.  But don't leap at every opportunity to put a lip lock on a programmer's ass.  Just maintain an appropriate level of self respect.  Don't put up with shit from programmers or players.  E.g. a player told me all of my games totally suck, especially Tanbo.  This after he played Tanbo 40 times.  Granted he was having a temper tantrum after I apparently set him off, but nonetheless.

If your game is good enough, it'll be around for centuries.  Or even millennia if it's as good as Oust, Crossway, Cephalopod, etc. - long after the unappreciative have died and rotten in the ground.
