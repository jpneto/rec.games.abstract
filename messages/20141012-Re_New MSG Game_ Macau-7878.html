What makes me worry about your game is that the first player who win the 6-set has high probability to win the game. Did you test that hypothesis?

Starting from winning the 1-set then the 2-set then the 3-set and son on will make the game more strategic if you make the fighting for each set level harder. You will suppress the direct win 666-333 (it is all luck!). Knock out at the start of the game.

Thank you for the feedback, Hazen.  Certainly the first player to obtain a 6-6-6 is more likely to win.  Even the 5-5-5.  Or a 6-6-5-5.  As in all games, once you've attained an advantage of some sort, you're more likely to win.  What matters is that Player 1 is not more likely to get the first 6-6-6 just because he's the first to roll.  The reason is that Player 1 makes a half roll of 6 dice on his first turn, and Player 2 makes a full roll of 12 dice on his first turn.  And then both players make full rolls of 12 dice on every turn thereafter.



Yes, there's more work to do here.  Again, thank you for the feedback.  And thank you for inspiring me in the first place :)

In the gambling it is worse if you have an advantage at the beginning because the opponent player will not have an incentive to double the bet. Hence the first player either 1 or 2 to win the 6-set win the game.
So the game will not lead to some surprises.
Look at the chessgame : even if one the player have a material advantage he could loose.
I still remember one game won by Alekhine or Capablanca (my memory is failing) where he lost almost all the pieces (a knight, a bishop and a rook) but after a terrific attack with the queen and 2 or 3 pieces left he won 10 or 12 moves the game!!!
If you start as I said by winning the sets one by one starting from 1-set and changing the score to win (21 instead of 11) there will only one winner.
Both can not reach 21.
You used a trick to have a drawless (21 sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6 not divisible by 2).
Good to have a drawless game (you seems to make it unconditional goal) but lot of scoring games k points against k points) could be ruled as the first one to reach k win. They could not reach both k points if the game is turn played.
There is still a way to maintain the same rules but changing the victory conditions. If one of the player win 6-set and 5-set you could introduce a mechanism giving more chance to the opponent. The more you win the less dice you roll or you roll a 4-sided dice where 6 and 5 do not exist at all. It was just an example of solution. You could find out more elegant one.
Good luck to you in your design.
I had never been interested until now in games gambling-like.
Casino games are not my best preference : I prefer Lotto 6/49, Lotto Max, draw lotteries where you choose your numbers. More challenging than casino games.
If I have 63 friends acting under my orders I will ALWAYS win the horse racing bet easily. How to form a group of 63 persons or at least 31 persons?
