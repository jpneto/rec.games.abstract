 I spend a week defending you and your game and this is what I get.  If I knew you were going to be that fucked up about it I wouldn't have mentioned it.  Holy shit what a baby.

I mentioned it the first time because I was drunk and you were all like "you'll never be as good as me Luis huehuehuehuehuehue". Then I mentioned it here because you were obviously talking about me and indirectly calling me a greaseball and directly calling me a retard in the other thread. As for defending me and my game, I don't remember you doing that. If you're talking about Abadoucha then I hardly need to be defended from him, he's like a fruitfly buzzing around everybody's head. Not even annoying, just barely detectable.
