Hi!

I'd like to present you an original game named Tourrosa.

It is a games where pieces stack, unstack, jump, slide around the
board and generally move a lot on each turn. The goal is to capture
all the opponent's pieces.

Tourrosa is played on a very twisted board. This board is very
interesting, since a piece can pass through it touching twice each
cell and once each arc. This means that no piece is safe! I played
it quite a lot, and find it really funny to play!

It is very difficult to represent the board in ASCII, so I cannot post
the rules here. You can find them at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nomignolov.wikidot.com/tourrosa-rules">http://nomignolov.wikidot.com/tourrosa-rules</a>
and some beautiful images of examples of movements at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nomignolov.wikidot.com/tourrosa-moves-examples">http://nomignolov.wikidot.com/tourrosa-moves-examples</a>
(the site at wikidot has just started, so if you don't know about my
freeware for abstract games Nomignolov, please visit
nomignolov.blogspot.com).

You can also download the pdf with the rules, in English and in
Italian.

Have a good game!
Bye, Jean
