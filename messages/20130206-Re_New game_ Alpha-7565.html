Agreed.

Same 1-2-2... move protocol with the option to place either color and a very similar object. Same pie-rule, same tie-rule. The difference is in the object.

Alpha doesn't have the 1-2-2 move protocol. Only one stone is placed per turn, as in Nick's original version of the game (Product War). The tie rule isn't the same, either. Black wins ties is Produto (and Product War).

On the one side I like the object of Alpha better. Your argument regarding 10x10 or 21x4 shows that this kind of tension is present in Produto, 'central' even, but it is very much 'by example'. If the third group is '5', you've countered the threat already, and there are only 3 groups involved. I feel the reduction resulting from connecting opponent's groups is a clear and present general threat in Alpha, while in Produto it is more specific and at times it might be fading.

I have a similar impression. If a player has n stones at the end of the game, the lowest possible score is n, which can be achieved in two opposite ways: by having one group of size n or n groups of size 1. The incentive to grow the biggest group and the incentive to create new groups are therefore the same. 

I wouldn't go as far as to say that Alpha is better than Produto, though. I'd have to test it more thoroughly first.
