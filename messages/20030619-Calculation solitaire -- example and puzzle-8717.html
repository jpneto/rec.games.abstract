Google won't let me follow-up to old messages, so I've cut and pasted
from an old message in this group to give the rules of Calculation solitaire
below.

The rules describe G(4); G(3) is the same but only three holding piles
are allowed (Alpha, Beta, Gamma).  I win G(3) about 65% of the time.

I was asked for a sample game, so copied this one down.
I didn't record the moves to get to this position, but
remember thinking early on that ``if I lose it will
be because I got too many 6's before any 3's.''

But by the time I took the ``snapshot,'' all 3's had appeared
and the dangerous holes left by the 6's had been taken care of.

Here is the position:
------------------------

        Building Board:    A23   2468TQA3   36    48Q3

        Workpile Alpha          Workpile Beta           Workpile Gamma
            K---                    -J--                    ---6
               K                     9                         2
            Q                         7                     6   
               9                      4                       8
               5                     7                         7
            J                         A                       2
                                      J                       Q
                                    9                           
                                     5                          
                                    8                           
                                       T                        

(I've staggered the workpile cards to show where they will eventually
play on the board.)

The remaining eleven cards (in unknown order) are KKTT55J974A.


What is the chance you wil win from this position?
---------------------------------------------------

Less than 100% surely, as you have no chance if the next
four cards are K,K,T,T in that order.
Another sequence that hurts is 5,5,7 but this is not necessarily
deadly -- you win if the following cards are 4,9 (in either order).

In can be shown (I think) that you have a definite win over 5/9
of the time: as long as a K appears before a T (that is any
of six permutations except TTKK, although K at <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
end is no trouble) and a 7 appears before a 5
(that is any of three permutations except 557).
Even then you win if (94 or 49) appear early enough,
or combinations like (55J94).

I'll try to calculate and post the exact odds of winning,
if there's interest and no one beats me to it.

 ===========  Rules of Calculation Solitaire ============

In the recent millenium in <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:CFuKA4.Bu1@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz">&lt;CFuKA4.Bu1@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz&gt;</a>
Bill Taylor (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:wft@math.canterbury.ac.nz">wft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</a>) described a solitaire game:
# CALCULATION
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# A shuffled pack is face-down before you,
# and cards turned over one by one.
#
# Each card, on being turned over, must be played onto either:
! one of H "holding piles", or:  one of four "goal piles".
!    We'll call this game G(H).  Usually G(4) is played.
!    The top card of a holding pile can also be moved to an
!    appropriate goalpile at any time. [jda]
# The four goalpiles are built up regardless of suit, but in different ways.
# One must begin with an Ace, one with a 2, one with a 3, and one with a 4.
# Subsequent cards may be put on, if the number is exactly "n" above the last
# card placed, for pile with base "n";  all done modulo 13;J=11,Q=12, K=13.
#
That is to say the four goalpiles are built up, without regard to
suit, as:
 A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K.
 2,4,6,8,T,Q,A,3,5,7,9,J,K.
 3,6,9,Q,2,5,8,J,A,4,7,T,K.
 4,8,Q,3,7,J,2,6,T,A,5,9,K.
The game is won if you play all 52 cards to the goalpiles.
#
# [At first, G(4)] seemed so hard that I couldn't believe it would
# ever come out, not beyond a lucky 1% at most, anyway.  But as I
# struggled more ... I almost thought I could win nearly every time,
# if I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> concentrated on the calculations!)
#
# Give it a whirl !
