Clark, you have one interesting game - Particle Bond.  Canvas hit the
canvas, as we all remember, and Ki is the game you wouldn't shut up
about until you finally admitted privately that it's bullshit.  That's
all you've got.  You're like Gering with the psuedo-eminence.

You were talking to me recently about "passing the torch."  The torch
isn't something that gets passed.  The torch is something you take,
and boy you've got a lot of taking to do.
