I keep hearing grumblings about how I stifled the "activity" here in rga.  Like, before I "showed up", there was limitless activity.  Not to direct this at you Corey, but let's face it.  You're the primary grumbler.  I was here every day for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>years<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> before <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> showed up.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>know<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> what the activity was here.  Primarily it was Bill Fathead Taylor socializing with his friends, relentlessly congratulating each other for their latest stupid, stupid Nim variant, which was usually nothing more that a variation of their previous stupid Nim variant.  There was me announcing a whole lot of games (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/MSG_game_index.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/MSG_game_index.html</a>) in a relatively short period of time.  Almost all of my games were completely ignored because they weren't deemed worthy by the fathead.  And there was Leroy Quet introducing mathematical recreation games.  I don't know what happened to Leroy and I don't care, though I did make it clear to him that he was welcome, at least by me.

The only people I ever chased out were Bill Taylor, with the help of Christian Freeling, and then Christian Freeling himself after he outlasted his usefulness and started licking his own balls.  Gone too are Bill's posse of fellow nitwits, who left of their own accord.

There's still plenty of bandwidth available for real designers such as Nick, Corey, Luis, etc. to discuss whatever the fuck you want.  Stop blaming me for the fact that 1. Your respective productivities have tapered off, 2. You've got hardly anything you even want to discuss, and 3. Nobody wants to engage you on the primarily boring things you do want to discuss.

The greatest "activity" that ever took place here was that big, protracted bar room brawl in which Corey started recre.games.combinatorial, purportedly to host Bill Taylor's displaced social club, as well as to accommodate all this mysterious "activity" that never materialized.  It was the most ludicrous thing I ever saw, online or off.
