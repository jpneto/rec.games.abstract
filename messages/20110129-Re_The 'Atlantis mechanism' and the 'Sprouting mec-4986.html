Moves like a queen when not giving birth, but can only give birth
after a one square move.  The whole context of how the resurrector
works is so different from Monkey Queen that intellectual priority is
a non-issue, IMHO, and was not why I brought it up.  I was only adding
to Christian's citation of two other games that used a related
mechanism.

Responding to something else in this thread, Christian is right about
there currenty being a tendency toward dilletantism in chess
variants.  It seems that everyone wants to promulgate every half-baked
idea that comes into their heads and proclaim it as a new chess
variant.  (This does not apply to Renaissance, by the way.)  Some of
them are playable, most of them are mediocre or bad.  There are even,
so help us, those who spend their time imagining every possible type
of useless piece in 2 or more dimensions and write long articles
explaining why they gave them the preposterous names they did.  I kid
you not.  Go to chessvariants.org and read some of the stuff that
Charles Gilman excretes (Mr. Gilman is also the prime example of one
who "invents" huge numbers of opaque and uninteresting variants with
no playtesting or analysis at all.)  I remain a fan of the well
designed and well analyzed chess variant, of which there are fine
examples, but which is a disappearing species thanks to the ease with
which the Internet has made possible self-aggrandizing promulgation.
Rant off.  Thanks for listening.
