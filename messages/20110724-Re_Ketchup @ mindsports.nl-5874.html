Ever seen a position where a baby could have checkmated if it hadn't
been obliged to crawl towards the target to satisfy the inventor's
cyclophobia? The rule hampering the game?

And Monkey Queen is still hailed as "new" on your page, because you
can't come up with something new. The "millions of ideas awaiting
implementation" are rather evasive at the moment, aren't they. Fora
can be so distracting.

OK, Christian, have to call you on this.  Arguing that a baby's
inability to checkmate because of the movement rules is a clear case
of arguing with a straw man, actually a straw man that you've stood on
its head.  It's like criticizing chess because a player would have
been able to checkmate if not for that stupid rule that pawns have to
move forward only.  The rule determines the strategy and the tactics,
and if a player misses a mate because he put a baby in the wrong
place, that's the player's problem, not the game's.

As for not inventing new games fast enough, what would be fast enough
for you?  A one year old game seems pretty new to me, given the
lifespan of some games.
