Note that this is only an American phenomenom... Chess has always been
far more popular in Europe.  I tend to believe that it WAS just the
political situation that made chess popular in the US during the 70's.
Americans like to win... even more, they like to beat their 'enemies'.
why has chess fallen in popularity? perhaps because America was only
briefly ontop during the Fischer era...  Once the Soviets dominated
the game, then they lost interest.  You use Hockey as an example, well
Hockey is not a huge game in the US,  but here in Canada we win alot
and the game is THE game in Canada.  Most of the NHL players in the US
were raised in Canada.  You say there wasn't an outbreak of hockey in
the US? hmmm look at howmany more NHL teams are in the US than Canada
now... compare that to the 70's...

How often does Chess end up on TV in Europe?

Chess on TV is pretty boring unless you are into it.  I know alot of
people who like to play chess but have never played in a club.   Alot
of these people watch games online or review them in a pgn viewer.
World wide, Chess is watched alot.  How many of us have been following
Corus?  I bet Ive watched more corus matches than hockey games on TV
(and im canadian!).  Its hard to judge just what the audience is for
chess, because unlike many other games, we can easily watch a game
going on on multiple websites.  I personally like to dl the pgn of the
games and run them through fritz... is this considered 'watching' the
game? all this and without irritating commercials :).  Chess is
probably unique in this aspect.

I read a book on poker, Copyright 2000, that said said pretty much the
same about poker, that it was boring to watch on TV.  Well, they found
a way.

If chess was on TV, I don't know that I would watch the show.  I find
most TV is irritating anyways.  I prefer how it is now, you can watch
the game live on websites with GM's kibitzing (and many patzers too :)
Also for TV you need real 'characters'... chess players are generally
very introspective people who 'play the board'.  Unlike poker where
acting ability increases your chance of winning thus producing many
'characters'.

Actually, acting does NOT increase your chance of winning.  You play
against a pro and act, the pro will read you and figure out mostly
when you are have good hands or bad hands.  The best poker player
places like "Jesus" Ferguson and is like a rock at the table.
Everything is uniform and consistent and you can't tell anything.
That is the funny part about poker on TV.   What poker REALLY is, is
not seen.  People don't see why people win or not.  They just see the
highlights mostly.  The best poker players are introspective in
knowing themselves, and also reading their environment, and keeping
their big mouth shut.  Look up "poker face", and that should compare
to what chess players would play like.  Of course, there will be a
bunch of emotion at tables, and sometimes there is trash-talking.
Come to think of it, isn't that what Fischer did?  Fischer was Phil
Helmuth, before the poker brat Phil Helmuth showed up.  Maybe players
projecting more emotion and their personalities before and after a
chess match would help.

Some would argue that is at least twice what I bring to these
