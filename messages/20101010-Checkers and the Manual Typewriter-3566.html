What is robustness and why does robustness matter?  An oversimplified
definition:
  1. Low first (or second) move advantage.
  2. Low draw rate.

Why is this oversimplified?  Because <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>every<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> game has a low first move
advantage and a low draw rate the first few times you play it.  You
have to become more skilled before the problems start to emerge.

Fictionalized game announcement:

"Hi guys.  My new game, Fuckall, is highly robust.  I've played it
over 100 times and there was an "almost-draw" a couple of times, but
never any real problems."

This is like selling a used car, slapping the customer on the back,
and saying "I'm pretty sure you'll make it off the lot without any
trouble, but in any case, it's yours now."

GROWING DRAW RATE PRINCIPLE Whatever the draw rate is starting out,
it'll grow.  It'll either grow quickly to where the game is soon
ruined for everyone, like Abalone.  Or it'll grow more slowly like in
Chess or Checkers where you have to become extremely skilled before
the game is overrun with draws.  Or your game could be like Shogi, if
you're lucky, where the draw rate is relatively low (I believe) among
experts.

TRUTH IN ADVERTISING You have no way of knowing how drawish your game
will be without years of intense practice and strategic development.
All you can honestly tell prospective players is that you've played
the game n times and there's currently a small/medium/large chance of
a draw occurring between you and an equally experienced player.  And
that there's an m percent first move advantage at that experience
level.

You have no basis for making claims about what your game would be like
after 10n plays or 100n plays.  What kind of a charlatan makes the
"lifetime to master" claim about his own game after playing it only
100 times?  The only way to know that would be to spend a lifetime
mastering it, or know of people who did.

TIME INVESTMENT People waste their time with games like Batalo and
Abalone that end up swamped in draws.  They can't continue to advance
strategically.  It becomes stupid and they drop it.  All that playing
time could have been invested in a robust game that allows the
development of rich strategy, unrestrained by the limits of a shittily
architected game.

For Checkers there should be a disclaimer that after a few years of
seriously studying the game you'll be completely awash in draws.
There's a time limit on how long the game will continue to function.
Checkers is a lovely example of a non-robust game.

SCALABILITY Very closely related to robustness is degree of
scalability.  Oust and Flume are, for example, very scalable games.
If you outgrow the game (i.e. if move order advantage became a problem
or draws, which of course can't occur) at a certain board size, boom,
just bump it up and you're good to go.

Checkers isn't nearly as scalable because of the non-uniform
distribution of pieces and the arbitrary decisions that must be made
about the next larger (or smaller), non-uniform distribution of
pieces.  Chess is totally non-scalable, shit like Grand Chess
notwithstanding.

CHECKERS AND MANUAL TYPEWRITERS  As you all know, I hate even a single
draw because it's the failure of a game to perform its function and
it's a grandiose waste of time.  But many disagree.  A regurgimorph
from Patrick Carroll at bgg (no offense Patrick, but your post in
particular lent itself to the discussion):

"The outcome [in Checkers] is almost meaningless. Is a boxing match
necessarily boring if it goes ten or twelve rounds, or necessarily
exciting if there's a knockout in the second round? Is a baseball game
bad if it goes into extra innings?"

No, because in those instances of spectator quality, professional
competitions, at least there's the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>chance<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the game resolving
itself.  There's excitement!  There's anticipation!  At the Checkers
competition, there's boredom.  You already know the outcome in advance
- a draw.  An abstract game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>can<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be tremendously entertaining to
spectators, but it must be a robust game.

Draw haters have heard this shit about Checkers many times.  We're
tired of hearing about Marion Tinsley and his famed knack for forcing
draws and his never growing weary of such.

Manual typewriters are to word processors as non-robust games are to
robust games.  They suck.

Fictionalized testimonial:

"I like manual typewriters because of the feel and the sound and if I
make a mistake I get to use my whiteout, which is exactly like
painting my nails except white instead of black...."

Checkers <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a kids' game.  If you're an adult, stop playing it.
Play an adults' game like Cage instead.
