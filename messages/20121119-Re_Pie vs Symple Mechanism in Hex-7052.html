I too have a bit of a gripe with Symple, but it's much, errrm, 
simpler than the questions about balance: it's that having to place 
like 8 stones per turn or more on some turns feels awkward and can 
lead to overwhelming analysis paralysis, for me anyway. I don't think 
I can really comfortably go more than 4 stones per turn in a 
placement game, and even that's pushing it.

Yep, good point, Nick.  It's like trying to control dynamite while it's exploding.  I've been thinking about Symple gameplay lately too.  Not just the balance issue.  I'm someone with truly horrible intuition.  We all know that.  But it doesn't stop me from speculating.  

Symple is conceptually as opaque to me as a slab of granite.  You've got a huge penalty of at least -6 per group.  So I guess what you'd want to do is build up a bunch of singletons and then eventually merge them into a big meatball, or something.

Symple's balance is still a concern though.  Why did Christian gradually change the parameter from at least 2 to at least 4 to at least 6?  It has to be a balance issue.  As skill levels slowly increase, so must the minimum value of the parameter.  What else could be the reason for increasing it?  Is it too tactical at the smaller parameter values?  Too opaque?  Those aren't reasons to strictly rule out the smaller parameters.  It has to be an ongoing balance issue.

I actually want to play Symple a few times, admittedly to see how bad it is..  Out of time for now, but meet me later in Arty's (Toguz free - yay!) sandbox.
