An example: I started to play Hex at Little Golem an won three games in a row against players who have already played dozens of games by finding killer moves by pure reasoning. Not so in Havannah. I simply cannot find good moves here by reasoning. I call this game "experience based" rather than "reasoning based".

Experience will eventually give you the basic strategic lay-out a game will take after the first couple of moves. There's quite a number of them but all eventually evolve around speed and initiative. <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Counting<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is the fundament of all reasoning in Havannah.

By the way, I'm eagerly awaiting your response in your Dameo game against Benedikt. You're caught up in one of his Devil's Brew combinations I fear ;-)

You probably await my resignation :) But I intend to put up some fight yet. I all goes well I will be one pawn down but with a slightly better position. Or maybe it is just wishful thinking. I love those melee fights in draughts-like games. Little Golem would do well to implement Dameo or Bushka. Dameo is great but nothing beats Bushka. Bushka's greatness stems from the tension between column capture and single piece capture. It's the only game of this kind. Precedence of column capture  introduces another dimension to the gameplay. More posibilities of planning. Dameo in comparison seems like a straightforward evolution of draughts. Bushka is revolution. By the way, have you noticed that king's capture in Bushka always stops on the same square as ordinary piece capture (even in intermediary steps)? Bushka = Killer's Bushka. Sweet. To me Bushka's kings are the most natural and most balanced of all draughts kings.
