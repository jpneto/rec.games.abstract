This sounds more interesting than Basic, which I believe will almost
always be a first-player win (see below).  One question, though: Doesn't
the move in figure 6c violate the limitation that you can't hide one of
your own checkers when moving backwards?

In Basic, each move by a player brings the player exactly one space
closer to winning, so it is only if the first player must pass more
often than the second player that he loses.

The only way a player is required to pass is if all his pieces are
covered by opponent pieces, so a simple strategy for avoiding this is to
spread your pieces as much as possible.  If all your pieces are on
separate squares, the opponent must have one piece covering each of
yours to make you pass, so if you cover just one opponent piece, this
can't happen.  If an opponent covers one of your pieces, it is "safe" to
put one on top of that, even if this means your pieces are not maximally
spread (the opponent still has to use all his movable pieces to cover
your to make you pass).

So, basically (no pun intended), a simple first-pleyer strategy is to
avoid putting a piece directly on top of another of his pieces while
also attempting to cover at least one opponent piece.

You can't use this simple strategy in Riptide, though, as the opponent
can move some of your pieces backwards by covering them, so the progress
is not exactly one space per move: Moving a covered piece forward
increases your relative progress by two (+1 to your own, -1 to the
opponent).  The rule that you can't cover all opponent pieces also makes
analysis more complex.
