Jackspritz, I don't know who you are, but I posted a game in Nick
Bentley's thread. I don't attack people, and I try to stick to a
threads subject. Yet many comments are personal attacks, and you even
admit to derailing threads only because Mark posts in them. Do you
think that's fair to me or others? Or do all posters agree with your
mission?

Nick Bentley, it didn't you take long to use elements of Symple, the
moment I had posted it:
-----------
Quote: "I had a Eureka moment today, courtesy Christian Freeling.
Christian has a new game called Symple, the core of which is an
inventive rule specifying how a player may add stones to the board.
The rule is: you may either place one stone, not adjacent to any other
like-colored stones, or grow any/all of your preexisting groups by one
stone each. A conundrum results: do you add one measly stone so that
you have more groups to grow later, or grow your groups now without
increasing the number of groups?
( ... )
When I read about Christian's drop mechanism in Symple, I saw that it
was ideal for my purpose (Although I did simplify it slightly for my
game). If played on a board with an odd number of cells, it yields a
drawless game without clunky restrictions. It feels beautiful to me,
perhaps because I've been pondering the problem for so long."
------------

And I'm glad to oblige, although you have emphatically refrained from
playing any of my games at iGGC ever.
And a "Eureka" moment as I understand it, is a flash of understanding
in your own mind, not finding someone else's. I had a eureka moment
regarding Symple's mechanism.

I am also the only one who made a tangible contribution to the contest
you started. I can't say I feel very welcome there though, because
much of the energy is not directed to get any contest going, but to
derail the thread.

Jackspritz, I don't feel 'baited and patronized' by Mark, but I feel
much of the energy here is totally misdirected. What must I do to
blend in? Rant? Attack people personally?

I made a game in 90 minutes, when Bill's suggested theme suddenly
touched a chord. It fits the theme perfectly, be it that Bill
mentioned something about the board being full at the end.
Like Go (and that's as far as this comparison is intended) the board
will not grow full in Whingi and the game will implicitly end with a
double pass. I think the theme Bill suggested would allow for that.

But has anyone actually commented on the game? I'm very sorry, but I
don't think posts here are very fruitful.
