<br>While it does indeed pay you to get a win and a loss rather than two draws, 
it's also the case you can less afford to let your opponents get away with a 
win that might have been a draw for exactly the same reasons...

<br>I suspect people just play their game the way they play their game as that way

<br>The point you are missing is that how you play depends upon how
<br>it counts. I've taken draws because they count one-half that I
<br>never would have taken had they counted one-quarter.
<br>Everyone has.
<br>
<br>The one-half number has empirically been proven to not be
<br>a sensible value for a draw, because it leads to so many
<br>games that are not contested at all, i.e. draws are essentially
<br>agreed before play starts.
<br>
<br>It's a very curable defect, whether or not I am overestimating
<br>the benefits that will accrue from making the fix.
