Just so that there's no confusion -

Deadline for entries:
March 1st
(I hope you can make it Corey!  I look forward to your entry.)

Deadline for decision:
March 20th
(should we have a minimum number of voters? else extend the decision
date a week so long as not enough votes are in?)

Stax and MQ - stay in the contest... I wasn't about to Oust them
anyhow.
(Does this mean that I can enter a multiplayer card game I'm working
on ^^?  It's abstract and is even considered a 'stacking game' such as
Tichu)

Mark - It's just an internet contest.  You give your nemesis' too much
credit... and probably too many ideas lol.  Nobody's winning a Yacht
so I don't see the fuss.  If MQ loses I'm sure people will still play
it.

A note on prizes... this is why I prefer contests with no actual
prizes.  The point is to make and play some fresh games! Whichever one
you like best you can vote for!  I anticipate and am not looking
terribly forward to voting drama lol.

I still really like the reward of the winner getting an honest BGG
review by as many people as possible!

The winning condition that can't be tampered with is the possibility
of creating or playing an amazing new abstract!  Even better... the
possibility of playing or creating more than one so that it's painful
to choose which is better!

Christian - Any ideas for the next 'abstract theme' contest?
