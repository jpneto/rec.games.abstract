<br>
<br>&nbsp;it is difficult to back up the assertion, either way, for
<br>&nbsp;a sufficiently complex abstract game.&nbsp; you need an enormous
<br>&nbsp;sample size.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;i am curious why there arent simply games with one move for the
<br>&nbsp;first player and then 2 moves back and forth the rest of the way.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;progressive chess goes 1 move, 2 moves, 3 moves, 4, 5, 6, 7...
<br>&nbsp;has there been any research on 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...?&nbsp; it isnt
<br>&nbsp;clear to me was the progressive chess tempo advantage is.&nbsp; if
<br>&nbsp;just count the cumulative moves, it goes 1-0, 1-2, 4-2, 4-6,
<br>&nbsp;9-6, 9-12, 16-12, 16-20....but defending for an 8-move turn
<br>&nbsp;must be a nightmare.&nbsp; with 1,2,2,2,2...the analysis paralysis
<br>&nbsp;problem may be held under control.&nbsp; however, this fairy chess
<br>&nbsp;version may have already been shown to lead to an unsatisfactory
<br>&nbsp;game in the past.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;my approach to this problem was different.&nbsp; i split up the move
<br>&nbsp;into 2 parts, with each player having control over one of the 2
<br>&nbsp;parts.&nbsp; it's sort of like baseball beginning with the ball in
<br>&nbsp;the pitching hand of the defense.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;certainly there must have been a fairy chess game where your
<br>&nbsp;opponent gets to pick which moveable piece you must use.&nbsp; i
<br>&nbsp;would suspect that would need a lot of fixups to actually work,
<br>&nbsp;without thinking to hard about it.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;however, to return to Hex and its variations, this "pitching"
<br>&nbsp;approach cant apply unless the board is multicolored and you
<br>&nbsp;are given a color you have to play your move on.&nbsp; Hex naturally
<br>&nbsp;leads to 3 colors, but you could have any number.&nbsp; despite
<br>&nbsp;seemingly having control, the defense will eventually have to
<br>&nbsp;pick a losing color.
