The last player that can move loses.

Variation: The first player that cannot move loses.
(The difference between the original version and the variation is
simply that in the original version, if a player places a p-1, where p
is a prime, but the other player can't place a p, then the player who
placed the p-1 loses. In the variation, the player who cannot place a
p loses.)

You don't explain what happens if a player is able to place p but is
unable to place all the subsequent composite numbers.

I should have said that, in the original version, the last player that
can make a motion loses. In the variation, the first player that
cannot make a motion loses. So, if a player cannot put down any of
their composites, they lose.

Thanks for your interest,

I'm also curious whether the game would be interesting on an infinite
board.  Obviously the players could arrange to charge off in one
direction and never turn back, but if they're actually trying to win,
can the game terminate?  It feels like it should be possible to lay
down a zigzag boundary (as composite motions must alternate vertical
and horizontal) that completely encloses some region, then force play
inside that region.  Eventually one player will get to fill in enough
numbers in one move that he'll be able to force play into an enclosed
area all by himself.  (Looks like playing 16 numbers in one move would
be enough, for instance.)
