Not much time to write at the moment but with all this demand for my
opinion, I'll respond!

1) I love the feedback rule. It's simple and easy for a player to
follow, and my experience with feedback rules tells me it has a good
chance of being the right strength, which is hard to do.

2) Not in love with the win condition. It's good in the sense that it
will probably create the right tensions, but I prefer win conditions
which are simple enough and visual enough that you know who won by
glancing at the board, without calculation. Hex and other simple
connection games are my ideal here. Ketchup's win condition works for
me only because it's possible to play with a scoring track, which
keeps each player's status visual, and even that skirts the edge of my
preferences.

So a question for me is: what simple, visual win condition is most
naturally paired with your supercool mechanism to produce a good
game?

Corey Clark has been trying for a loooooong time to create a
connection game with just the right amount of coldness in it, and it
occurs to me that your mechanism might be the ticket. So while the Hex
connection goal is horrifically unoriginal, combined with your
feedback mechanism it might solve Corey's problem and make an
exquisite game.

But ideally, I'd like to think of an original win condition which is
the natural conclusion to a game with your mechanism, and which is
also visual. Nothing's popping into my head. I'll think about it later
when I have more time.
