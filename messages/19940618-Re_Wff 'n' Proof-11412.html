This does sound interesting. Can you please post the
title of the book, and where the cubes might be purchased?

The book+cubes+playing mats+timer all come in one package.

You can order it from:      WFF'N'PROOF PUBLISHERS
                            1490 South Boulevard
                            Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104-4699

Phone: (313) 665-2269

They occasionally advertise in Scientific American magazine.

Also, you might be interested in other games they sell:

EQUATIONS: Essentially the same structure as WFF'N'PROOF, but uses
  arithmetic expressions instead of symbolic logic. Easier to introduce
  to newbies.

ON-SETS: Again the same basic game structure, but expressions in the
  notation of set theory are used. My favorite of these 3 games is
  EQUATIONS, mainly I suppose because it's easier to find opponents.

CONFIGURATIONS: Actually a solitaire game, or a series of puzzles, which
  introduce you to some geometrical concepts, what the author calls "The
  Geometry of Incidence." Arrange plastic digits on a series of patterns
  which are labeled The Fano 7(3), The Pappus 9(3), etc. Interesting.

THE MEDITATION GAME: Not advertised as far as I know, I got this game as
  a bonus when I ordered from them. The board is small (7 by 7), the rules
  are simple, the game is a challenging diversion.

They sell other games also, but I don't know much about them.

Is anyone interested in the answers to the Tardy Bus puzzle?
