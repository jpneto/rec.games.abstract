No there doesn't and the point is irrelevant anyway.  If and when
something happens for the first time, such a statement of surprise

I think definitely not.  This is in fact exactly the misconception that
cost Kasparov the match against Deep Blue.

I corrected you once before on this point; the situation referred to
occurred in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>PREVIOUS<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> match that Kasparov won.

Your statement is a non sequitur.  What I said is exactly true: your
statement is wrong, your attitude toward "surprising" moves by computers
is wrong, it's the same misconception that Kasparov had, and it caused
him huge problems in his subsequent match.

This is pure B.S.  Why don't you at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>TRY<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to respond to what
I say.  Once again you follow your usual tactic of pulling a single
sentence out of context.  It's easy to counter an argument when you
remove the entire argument.

If you simply have something you want to say on a similar topic,
then I would appreciate it if you would start a new thread

No.  But you're welcome to follow through on your claim that you will
stop arguing.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Then respond to my points.  Not once have you done so.  Your
unrelenting habit of "responding" to my posts and then arguing
against a position that I do not hold is rather annoying.

The only point I made was in response to a general definition of
strategy and tactics.  I pointed out that while it was a reasonable
general definition, that it was difficult to impossible to make a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>precise<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> definition.  Not once have you addressed my point.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's not the only point you made.  You made the specific claim:
"Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make sacrifices for
strategic reasons."  Those are your very words.  According to you, this
is a fundamental limitation of computer programs.  And I think you're
wrong.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

For the last time,
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS OF COMPUTERS.
You are taking one sentence out of context and twisting it into
something it obviously does not say.  I've pointed this out before
and clarified my meaning to the degree that even a child could
understand it.  I'm not going to repeat it.  You can argue all
you want against something I never claimed; the only thing you're
proving by doing so is your unwillingness (or inability) to
understand a simple english sentence.
