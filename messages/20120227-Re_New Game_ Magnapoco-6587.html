This looks like a beautiful and original game.

Thank you kindly :)

I think I understand its strategical dilemma: you'd want to create as
few groups as possible so that the smallest of them is as big as possible, but you
shouldn't create too few of them, or you'll be more likely forced to
join them all in a single group later in the game and lose. If the
game works as expected, finding the right balance between these two
extremes could be an exciting challenge.

That's how I understand it as well. Although on a square board, it's
more about cutting off your opponent. On a hex board, it takes more
effort to keep your groups disconnected and it's a bit colder there.
I'm not sure which is best. I'd like to hear other opinions.  You can
also make the square board version colder by increasing the minimum
group size from 2 to 3 (or more, on boards larger than 7x7)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
However, I don't like the fact that the game starts from a fixed
position, and I think this is actually unnecessary. Instead, I suggest
starting from an empty board and stating the winning condition as
follows:

"When the board is full, the player whose smallest group is biggest
wins, unless it's his only group on the board, in which case he loses.
In case of a tie, etc."

With the current rules, the event of having only one group at the end
of your turn will only occur if you can't create any additional groups
after joining them all. This already requires a practically full
board, so it doesn't seem apropriate to make the "one group loses"
rule a sudden death condition which introduces the need for a starting
set-up. With my suggested rule, I'd say players will have more than
enough incentive to create more than one group from the very
beginning. Otherwise, his second group will have reduced growth
potential when it's finally created.

This is an interesting idea and it may turn out to be the best
version. I'm not sure. I considered it but decided not to do it for
two (very tentative and speculative) reasons.

1. the game could end with both players having one group, and because
of this, there might be some incentive for the player who will have
the largest one to play toward that end, which somehow doesn't feel
right.

2. I'm worried that a rather staid "bleeding in from the edges"
strategy will predominate. It's nothing more than a hunch at this
point.

I'll try to be by iggc later this afternoon. If you (or anyone else
reading this) is around, I'd like to test the different versions.
