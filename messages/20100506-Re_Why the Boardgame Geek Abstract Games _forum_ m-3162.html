Rich, it's abstract game, not abstract strategy game.  The whole world
has accepted the vastly less wordy, 100% equivalent upgrade phrase,
abstract game, except for Richard Hutnik who's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>still<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> **incredibly**
positing an asinine, dual definition. Rich, think.
rec.<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>games.abstract<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  International <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Abstract Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Organization.
Is any of this sinking in?  Do "abstract strategy games" have some
sort of special strategy that normal abstract games don't have?

Rich, it just seems like you're constantly campaigning to fuck up
abstract games somehow, this retro "abstract strategy game" crap being
only one prong of your offensive.

BoardGameGeek certainly matters in many ways.  But its abstract games
forum is not one of them.  It matters to you because you've just
tapped into a huge reservoir of Crapf retards.  You really hit the
jackpot, Rich.

I'll tell you why the bgg abstract games forum is irrelevant, and it's
not because you've plastered it with Iago advertisements.  It's the
same reason all bgg forums are irrelevant.  Mistress Octavia roams the
halls welting hapless backsides with her 2-1/2 foot Slim Jim.
Whatever remote chance there would be of an intelligent discussion
emerging amid throngs of grinning dopes is dashed to pieces by
Mistress Octavia.  A forum dominated by keyboard hero moderators
simply can't function in an intellectual capacity.
