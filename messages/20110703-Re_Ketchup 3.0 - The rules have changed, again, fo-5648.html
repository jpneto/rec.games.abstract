Also, if one player has two groups of equal size, do they both count
separately?

An example: both have a largest group of say 10, but one player
follows with a second of size 6 and a third of size 4, while the other
follows with two groups of size 6. Then the latter wins I presume,
because the second 6 counts separately and beats the 4 of the
opponent. Right?

Correct.

Here's another situation which could cause confusion, though it's
unlikely to ever come up. Let's say Player_1 has 4 groups total, of
size 10, 6, 4, and 1, and Player_2 has 3 groups total, of size 10, 6,
and 4.  Player 1 wins, and Player 2's 4th group must be considered to
be size 0*.

*note that the total stone counts don't add up to what you would get
on any hexhex board in the example. Too lazy to bother to come up with
the right numbers.
