Hi!

 From the look of the game boards you show, I guess that this game is
called Kalah. Correct me if I misunderstand you. Awari, or Ware, is
played on a board looking like this:

  4 4 4 4 4 4

  4 4 4 4 4 4

There are more complicated moving and taking rules, and games are long.

Concerning Kalah, one, two, and three stone Kalah can be solved by
full search. In an old AI book by Slagle and Dixon this is stated.
I wrote a small program myself, with the following printout:

Solving 1 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 2 stones.
A total of 2546 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 14 ply.
The search took 0 seconds.


Solving 2 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 6 stones.
A total of 1421452 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 49 ply.
The search took 13 seconds.


Solving 3 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 2 stones.
A total of 273277910 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 96 ply.
The search took 43900 seconds.


These were times when run on a SPARC station 2. I didn't record the
best moves here, but the principal variation starts with either a or
b. For three stone Kalah it is a, if I remember correctly.

   3 3 3 3 3 3
 0             0
   3 3 3 3 3 3
           ^ ^
           a b

Hope this helps...
