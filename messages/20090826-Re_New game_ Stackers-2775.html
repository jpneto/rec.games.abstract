Let's assume that this variant is even a game, which is a huge

What are your criteria for something being a game, since Stackers

Let's say two extremely defensive great, great grandmothers sit down
to play your game.  They've learned from decades of driving that one
can never be too careful.  They slowly advance their armies and meet
head to head in the middle.  And that's as far as they ever get.
Neither player wants to be the first to jump on the other.  Since
neither player will agree to a draw, they commit to sitting there and
jostling their back checkers from side to side for the rest of their
lives, which mercifully won't be too much longer.  Now what?  Do you
berate the great, great grandmothers because they aren't "playing
right"?  To me that's not a game.  A game is something you play, not
something you endure.

Indeed not.  And I did say that draws are possible if players cooperate

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A draw doesn't have to be forced by a losing player.  Players can
simply find themselves at some sort of impasse, caught in a loop of
moves, where the first one to break out of it loses.  No forcing or
player cooperation necessary.  This is almost certainly the case with
your game in my opinion.

which is
the main problem with infinite draws: If a player that has no hope of
winning can force infinite play, that is a problem, but I can't see
infinite play without both players copperating.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, the fact that you, someone with zero experience in the game,
can't see how a draw could occur doesn't matter.  Experienced players
could possibly figure out a way to fall into a loop of moves.  It's
more likely to happen than not with a new, draw prone game.  If
players can have a draw by cooperation then it's probably only a
matter of time before they have a draw without cooperation.

Why even take a chance like that?  It's like I want to sell you
a car with no spare tire because you're unlikely to get a flat.  What
if it turns out you get a flat every time you drive because the tires
are shitty?  It would be asinine in any other field but here it's ok.

Many good games have possibilities of draws: Chess and Go are just a few
examples.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, do not compare your game to Chess or Go.  Chess and Go are two
inevitable, very fundamental games.  Whether you like draws or not,
Chess and Go had to come into existence sooner or later.  Chess and Go
have the benefit of thousands of years of evolution.  They've been
shaped to perform very well for beginners and advanced players.  Chess
begins to crack under the pressure of extreme expertise, attained by
years of intense study.  Your game won't crack under years of intense
study.  Your game will crack the first time it's played - by overly
defensive beginners who are not cooperating, as I've already
demonstrated.

In fact, you can argue that the possibility of draws is an advantage for
deterministic games, as absense of draws implies that one player has an
advantage.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's ridiculous.  I'm so tired of these crank-theoretical, "perfect
play" arguments.  One player will have an advantage anyway, regardless
of the presence or absence of draws.  Chess has a huge first move
advantage.  Its potential for draws does nothing to mitigate that.  It
only makes the game worse.  The potential for draws can't possibly be
considered an "advantage" of any sort, in real terms or in theoretical
terms.  There's going to be move order advantage no matter what.  The
degree of move order advantage depends skill level of course.  A
balance should be struck between game length and move order advantage,
by, for example, varying the board size of a scalable game, experts
getting a larger board.  Move order advantage should be maintained at
such a level that the initial coin toss is more of an annoyance than a
liability.  The coin toss will never be a total non-issue.  The
abstract game is in the end, a game of luck, no less so than Poker
with it's initial, random dealing of the cards.  No game is perfect
and no game should be perfect.  Games can only function as games when
driven by imperfect play.  Arguments based on theoretical perfect play
are stunningly irrelevant.

I actually share some of the blame for this discussion.  My mention of
Basic's game tree was just supposed to be an aside, an "oh, by the
way" type of thing.  What I was trying to put across was how simple
Basic is, but one look at the rules and you can see that anyway.  If
I'd only not mentioned the game tree...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Stackers was not primarily an attempt to increase the game tree.  I
admit that the idea for Stackers grew out of this discussion, but the
main purpose was to make an interesting and fairly original game, the
original part being the rule for moving parts of stacks that are capped
on both ends by the moving colour.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Originality means nothing in a bad game or a non-game.  Please, and I
don't want to discourage you as a designer, but there are unlimited
avenues of creativity available to you - avenues that don't begin with
my games.
