Take this with a grain of salt, I'm terrible at Go:
When you create a ko, your opponent can circumvent it by making a
bigger threat somewhere else on the board, that you have to respond to
immediately. Then they can take back the ko move as though the rule
hadn't been enforced at all (since globally the board has changed.)
You are then in the same position, where you can reverse again if you
can make a bigger threat somewhere else first.

Where it gets interesting to me is: when you start such a fight, you
can't just look at how many threats you can make; you have to decide
how many threats are big enough that your opponent will answer them,
instead of letting you win that threat in exchange for their winning
the ko-fight. From what I've read, I think it's similar to the
"chicken" effect Christian Freeling described in Symple.

I appreciate the pleasure of finding the best move in a situation, but
I think the game becomes more interesting when you add that
psychological element. (I've learned to call it yomi, as designer/
author David Sirlin does, but that might be a video-game specific
term.)
