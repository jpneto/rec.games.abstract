You're absolutely correct about the "clever mechanisms and magnificent
architectures" lying around out there just hoping to one day be
discovered by someone.

I have always looked at discovering new game ideas, however, in other
to make something good and solid, if you know what I mean, I have to
start with the fundamentals first and the reason why I chose the most
popular Tic Tac Toe.

Once I have mastered these fundamentals, I can then look further over
the horizon, but for now, I'm keeping it low.

When I say design, I mean to design both the rules and the program
using "Game Maker", if you've heard about it.

However, the hardest part is the AI which I am woking on, and I must
say that it is really hard! The graphics won't be so flashy, but I can
always upgrade it afterwards.

If you like, I can let you test the Pre Alpha Version of the game when
I'm finished!
