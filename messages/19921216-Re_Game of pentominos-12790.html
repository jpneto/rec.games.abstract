After several tries I gave up a combinatorial analysis of the game of
pentominos. Would someone point me to a reference, or briefly explain
how one could compute the total number of solutions for a grid of a
given size (6x10, 5x12, 4x15, 3x20).

Ah... Good old pentominoes.
Several years ago, motivated by a passage in one of Clarke's novels, several
of us programmed pentominoes.
It is not very hard to solve it, it is a lot harder to solve it efficiently.
The programming was a lot of fun.
There are about 2100 solutions to the 6x10 case.

this has about as much to do with the game of pentominoes as the
elaborate solitaire games for the PC has to do with MahJongg....

the game of pentominoes, as described by martin gardner, consists
of the 12 pieces and an 8x8 board.  each of the 2 players takes one
of the unplayed pieces and positions it over 5 unoccupied squares.
the last player to move wins.  martin was impressed with its
complexity.

a LONG time ago, i was given a game called "Pan-Kai".  this is a
variant of the above played with 2 sets of pentominoes in 2
colors on a 10x10 board.  the objective was still the same - make
the last move.  the difference was that now you could make a "box"
in the shape of a piece you still had but your opponent didnt.  this
would give you an extra move at the end.  i played that game quite
a bit as a kid and found it quite intriguing.  i never got to play
the 8x8 version because by the time i found out about it, nobody
wanted to have anything to do with me &amp; my pentominoes.  :-)  :-(

oh well....later i invented my best game, QuintHex, using ideas
from Pan-Kai...there are exactly 12 quintastix, for example.

the sequence 1,1,2,5,12,35,108,....  is still unsolved, i bet.
