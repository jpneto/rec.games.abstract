First, I completely understand the rules of Grabber. It's a combinatorial game. Not really complicated.

The rules are as simple as Konane's but the resulting game is far more
complicated. I'd settle for that anytime :)

Anyway, "Your game has an aesthetic Hiroshima" is hard
to interpret as a compliment so I tried, unsuccessfully apparently, to
soften the blow by noting the grab mechanism is an interesting one,
which comment was unfortunately misinterpreted. [shaking head] :D

That part wasn't misinterpreted, the "I never got anywhere" was - I
thought playing Grabber didn't get you anywhere. Well ... come to
think of it, playing games may not get you anywhere in the first
place, but that's from a different perspective.
But even if not much is needed in your view, usually, to establish an
'aesthetic Hiroshima', I'd like to argue that Grabber is not. There is
an inherent logic in completing a capture in most games, but  given
the object it is certainly no coincidence that Konane has no such
obligation. I chose to refrain from it even before I checked and found
that, indeed, ancient Hawaiian Polynesians had reached the same
conclusion.
