                           CALL FOR PAPERS

          Special Track on Learning and Adaptation in Games

                                at the
 
             International Conference on Computer Games:
     Artificial Intelligence, Design and Education (CGAIDE) 2004     

                          8-10 November 2004
                    Microsoft Campus, Reading, UK

Artificial intelligence in computer games covers the behaviour and
decision-making process of game-playing opponents. In classic
analytical games, such as chess, checkers and go, the strongest
game-playing programs rely mostly on fast search techniques, whereas 
in commercial games, such as action games, role-playing games and
strategy games, the behaviour of opponents is commonly implemented as
simple rule-based systems. With a few exceptions machine-learning 
techniques are rarely applied to state-of-the-art computer game 
playing systems.

Machine-learning techniques may provide game-playing programs with the
ability to improve their performance by learning from mistakes and
successes, to automatically adapt to the strengths and weaknesses of a
human player, to learn from their opponents by imitating their 
tactics, or to discover new knowledge by analysing game collections or
perfect move databases. 

There is a relatively small group of enthusiastic researchers that
investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to enhance computer
games. Our aim is to bring them together at the CGAIDE 2004 
conference, by having a special track on "Learning and Adaptation in 
Games", with a good selection of high quality papers in this research 
area. We also strive to use this track to increase the computer-games 
industry's awareness of machine-learning techniques.


Topics of interest:

The special track on "Learning and Adaptation in Games" will cover the
application of machine-learning techniques to all aspects of computer
games. The track is limited neither to specific types of games, nor to
specific machine-learning techniques.


Submissions:

    Draft paper submission: 30 July 2004
    Notification of acceptance: 23 August 2004
    Camera-ready submission deadline: 13 September 2004

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. 
Authors of the best of the accepted papers will be invited to publish 
their papers in the on-line International Journal of Intelligent Games
and Simulation (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1822/ijigs.htm">http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1822/ijigs.htm</a>).

Detailed information on submitting papers is found at the CGAIDE 
website at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1822/cgaide.htm">http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1822/cgaide.htm</a>.
