The Accolade game licensed by Milton &amp; Bradley is one of the games   
I have. Milton &amp; Bradley are licensed by Jumbo to sell the game
in de USA. Jumbo is a Dutch company that made the game about 40
years ago. The game is most played in Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg,
Germany, Denmark and the USA. Jumbo sold about 20 miljon games.

Even the Jumbo-people say that the Accolade game plays poorly. The 
Stratego-machine they once made, played even weaker and was no succes.

The computer-program I am working on seems to agree with the people,
who say that a defending tactic is the best one. But the program is
far from ready. 

In Holland there is a kind of Stratego-championship. Some students
from Nijmegen started this competition. They wanted to find out if
the game is a lucky game. They held two Dutch championships. Both
years the same five people ended up in the top five, but not on the
same places. At the moment they are fighting and that probably means
the end of the championships.

I think there is little or no luck involved in Stratego. Like in 
chess the only luck is when your opponent makes a blunder, but
that is no "real luck", or when a risky move turns out to be a 
good one. But by playing a good game, you can prevent your opponent
to benefit from a risky move and try to win without making risky moves.

Blocking the sides off with bombs and put the strong pieces in the centre
is a winning strategy when playing the game against the accolade-program.
But one way to deal with this problem is to build in a distance-value.
For every miner move we determine the distance to (known) bombs. That
way the miner will walk towards the bomb and eventually capture the
bomb.
