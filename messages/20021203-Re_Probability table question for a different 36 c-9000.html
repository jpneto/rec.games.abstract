In the special Nuremberg-edition (die Siedler von N�rnberg) this is
already done. Instead of dice it contains a deck of 36 cards which
tell you what hexes will produce. It contains of course one 2, two 3s,
three 4s, etc. Most of them have a special event on them, one of which
is �shuffle the deck�. It makes things fairer because you know that if
a number has not come up in some time, it has a larger chance of being
drawn.

I recall discussion of Settlers, where, instead of dice, it was
suggested that there be a deck of 36 cards representing every
permutation of dice rolls to come up.  This approach is to insure an
even distribution of dice rolll results to balance things out.

Ok, my question is this:  Let's say, we have a deck of 36 cards.  The
deck consists of 6 cards of each possible die roll on a 6 sided die
(1-6), for 36 cards (6 1's, 6 2's, etc...).  The cards are shuffled
and TWO cards are flipped over and a die roll result is generated. 
What would the odds distribution be for doing this?  Would it be the
same as standard dice rolls or different?  I am curious, because I was
interested in kicking this around as a new way to generate two six
sided dice rolls.

The first time you have the same distribution as with dice. As soon as
you remove cards, the probability distribution changes in favor of the
numbers that have not been drawn yet. This is an effect of the limited
size of the deck. If your deck held 360 cards instead, the diffrence
would be smaller. This is one of the reasons why casinos use decks of
this size (6 complete 52-card decks make one 312-card deck), since
this will increase their chances against card counters (or mildly
intelligent players).

It will give you less of an advantage to know that 3 aces out of 24
are out than knowing if 3 out of 4 are out. In the latter case making
a blackjack is almost impossible. They also guard their statistics by
reshuffling the complete deck after using only part of it.

In a way, they are changing blackjack from a card game to a dice game.
This is profitable again, because in a dice game the players have less
information to work with to base their strategy on.
