Hi michael,

Well it seems to work with me.
But then again I am from europe. The Netherlands to be exact and That's near
the GIPF HQ in Antwerp. No problems for me. Maybe there was a server update
cause your daytime is nighttime up here. That's the only explanation I can
think of.

Any way this is a great time to ask you a few things about GIPF.
How long have you played GIPF?
What to you was/were the main threshold(s) when starting out with GIPF?

To anyone reading this I am asking because I am starting a a GIPF club. And
if you all are also willing to share your GIPF experience I might just get
all the
info to explain GIPF to a newbie on the points we think is difficult.

Hope you can help me out. Please mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:gipf@darklighter.nl">gipf@darklighter.nl</a>
