I try not to invent new games, because it sets me down the road to
distraction, but I was just inspired by Mark Steere's new game Lariat
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf</a>), which is played on
a cylinder.  I like the win condition and just thought of way one
might implement the same win condition on a standard 2D Hexhex board.
I haven't playtested this idea, but tell me what you think.  Here it
is:

Flat Lariat: the goal is to form a Lariat on a standard Hexhex board.
Players take turns filling cells their color, but <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the number<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of
cells that a player may fill on his turn depends on how eccentric
those cells are on the board.  There a couple of ways to implement
this idea:

1.  on his turn, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the cells that a player fills must lie along
one "ring" of the board, and the number of cells he can fill depends
on the eccentricity of the ring.  An open question for this system is
how many cells of each ring you can fill on your turn.  What do you
think?

2.  Each player on his turn gets a certain allotment of "placement"
dollars, and must spend a certain number of placement dollars to fill
a cell.  The cost of filling a cell depends on the cell's
eccentricity.  Filling the central cell is the most costly and
requires that the player spends his entire allotment to do so.

Please respond with feedback!
