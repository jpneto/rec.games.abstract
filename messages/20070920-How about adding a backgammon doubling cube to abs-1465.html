I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon
style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.

The idea:
1. Players play to an agreed number of points (obtained by playing a
series of a game), or a set number of games (the player with the most
points at the end wins the match).  Unless stakes are raised, players
get 1 point each if game ends in a tie.  Winner gets 2 points on a
win, zero with a loss.
2. Points per game start at 2.
3. If player asks opponent to resign, and opponent agrees, then their
opponent resigns.
4. If opponent doesn't resign, then for game are doubled.  The player
who raised the stakes must win the game, in order to get the full
amount of new points.  If their opponent wins they game, then the
opponent gets a full amount of points.  If game ends in a draw,
opponent gets half the amount of new points (this is done to encourage
players to play for win).
5. Redoubling is permitted.  A player is only allowed to double or
redouble once, until their opponent agrees to redouble.
