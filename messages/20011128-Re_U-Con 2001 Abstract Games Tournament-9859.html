Due to the lateness of the tournament announcement, many people were unable to
enter. In fact, there were only two people who made it to the tournament, but I
think it was a great success anyway, especially for this being the first year
I've run such a tournament. Mark Thompson drove in from Chicago, Illinois to
compete, and he said that next year he might bring a car load of others. Dan
Mawby of Wayne, Michigan was his opponent in all rounds. The games they played
against each other were chosen at random. That's my idea for the whole thing --
no randomness in the abstract games themselves, but the tournament structure
(both the games played and the opponents in each round, had there been more
people) were determined totally at random.

Anyway, Mark won the first two games -- Super Chinese Checkers and Hex (on an
11x11 board). But then Dan Mawby of Wayne, Michigan came back with a
hard-earned win in Christian Freeling's Glass Bead Game. Next, Mark upped his
record to 3 and 1 with a win at one of his personal favorites, Star (on a 6x5
board), and it looked like he was going to run away with the tournament. But
then Dan came back with three wins in a row -- a quick mate in Nana Shogi (with
the most recently updated rules from Georg Dunkel), then a stunning win in
Lines of Action, and finally a nice straightforward trouncing in Dan Troyka's
Breakthrough.

While all this was going on, I was an interested observer, but I didn't offer
any advice on play during the tournament, only answers to rules questions.
Incidentally, Mark was really surprised by Nana, having never studied Shogi or
any of its variants before. After the tournament he and I played a couple of
games of Bushi Shogi, another of Georg Dunkel's small variants -- just two
Samurai duking it out with swords, a very different take on the whole chess
genre. This was Dan's first experience with many of these games, and he seemed
pleasantly surprised by most of them. He was especially enthusiastic about
Lines of Action.

Hoping for more participants, I brought with me materials for about two dozen
more abstract games, but due to low participation, only these few were played.
I hope more people will enter next November.
