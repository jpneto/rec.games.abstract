<br>requiring a "word" to be divisible by 3 (or 5 or 7, etc),
<br>
<br>points for a "word" to be the value of the number protrayed in the "word" 
instead of the sum of the points of each peice of the "word".
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>A list of 0's and 1's is written on a piece of paper by the players
<br>taking turns, each player appending a 0 or a 1 onto the right side of
<br>the list each turn. After a predetermined number of turns (which is a
<br>multiple of the number of players), the first part of this game is
<br>over.
<br>
<br>In the second part of the game, the players take turns rewriting the
<br>entire list each turn with one digit the player chooses flipped from 0
<br>to 1 or from 1 to 0.
<br>
<br>The new list cannot match any list previously arrived at during the
<br>game.
<br>
<br>If the lengths of the runs of 0's and 1's form a permutation of the
<br>lengths of the runs from any previous list, then the currently moving
<br>player gets a point.
<br>
<br>(It doesn't matter if a particular run-length, an element in the
<br>permutation, was for a run of 0's or for a run of 1's.)
<br>
<br>The game continues until either a player first achieves a
<br>predetermined score or until no more moves are possible.
<br>
<br>The player with the greatest score wins.
<br>
<br>
<br>Example game (to start):
<br>
<br>001110101 (start: 2,3,1,1,1,1)
<br>000110101 (3,2,1,1,1,1 point)
<br>000111101 (3,4,1,1)
<br>000011101 (4,3,1,1 point)
<br>100011101 (1,3,3,1,1)
<br>101011101 (1,1,1,1,3,1,1)
<br>111011101 (3,1,3,1,1 point)
<br>111010101 (3,1,1,1,1,1,1 point)
<br>111010111 (3,1,1,1,3 point)
<br>... etc.
