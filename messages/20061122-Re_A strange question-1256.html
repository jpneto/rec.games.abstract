Take a look at Cephalopod.  People have commented that it's Chess like,
even though it has nothing to do with Chess.  It's something about your
choices and how far you can look ahead, etc.  People concentrate on
their moves and take a long time.  It's like watching a Chess game.
I've also designed a couple of games which use a Checkers board, but
I'd recommend Cephalopod as the most natural fit.

All of my games are played at SuperDuperGames.org, and I always keep a
challenge open as MarkSteere, if you want to try any of them out.  My
latest, Scribe, is getting a very favorable reaction.
