I'm not sure there is a game so deep an open-ended that doing an opening

go, monopoly or diplomacy have, is dependant on its popularity, not so much
its nature

My thought as well.  What would really seem to stifle analysis is a game
that is overly random rather than one that is overly "deep."

Mentioning Diplomacy is a good example.  While there are "ideal" plans,
it all depends on what the other players are willing to do.  Yet the
game has received extensive analysis.
