I know this comes up regularly, but I don't think it has for a while.

There's an 8/2/04 posting on the Chinook site ( 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/</a> ) that says they've solved one 
opening and it's a draw.  The opening is called the White Doctor: 10-14 
22-18 12-16.

A practical implication of this is that this opening should be removed 
from the three-move restriction tournament ballots, if in fact it's 
currently in them.  I don't know whether it is or not.

I'm sure this famous opening is currently allowed.  Openings have been
excluded only if they have been thought to give one side or other an
easy win.  The Chinook work will actually expand the allowable
repertoire, because some openings that are now considered unplayable
(because allowing an easy win) will be rehabilitated as draws or
extremely difficult wins.  (Games are played in couplets, so wins are
not per se unfair.)

I should say that I'm assuming that Chinook's analysis will be too
massive for humans to ever completely assimilate.  I suppose that
there is a possibility that openings could in the future be disallowed
on the basis that they offer too easy a draw.

As in chess, it will be fascinating to see the ultimate effect of
computers.  But checker players love to break new trails, and I am
sure they will adapt.  Solved or not, what a difficult game!

They expect to be solving the other openings more quickly now that this 
one has been solved.

Another interesting this is that the number of three-move restriction 
openings is smaller than the total number of openings because some 
openings are disallowed, so this makes the problem of solving checkers 
somewhat easier, at least under three-move restriction tournament rules.

I believe you are mistaken here.  Three move restriction includes
sequences that can be disregarded in go-as-you-please.  For instance,
to work out a draw for White in go-as-you-please, after, say, the
first move 10-15 Chinook will only need to work out a path (actually a
fabulous tree of paths) beginning with one strong White response, as
opposed to considering other White responses as dictated by the
ballots.  Similarly, to work out a draw for Black in go-as-you-please,
Chinook will only need to consider a single strong first move, such as
10-15.  Further, for each White response to 10-15, Chinook can focus
on a single Black reply, rather than several alternatives as contained
in the ballots.
