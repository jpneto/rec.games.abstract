There is a wate of time anytime you play :
- against an opponent too weak except if the goal to help him to improve his skills. I will enjoy if he or she enjoys. 
- a game in which more complexity add nothing to the gameplay except more burning brain for nothing. Instead of playing chess 4D (if Joyjoyce knows what is really 4D and what 4D means and implies) I prefer to play a game I never played before. What am I going to learn if I play chess 3D or 4D? nothing! 
- a game where what you will learn at the end of the gameplay does not worth your try. I will not play an abstract game easy to solve by an average human. You know the solution before even making the first move.

An abstract game has to be deep. What I mean by deep it that each you replay you discover something new (new way of moving new strategy new tactics and so on). As an example I play Cephalopod long time ago and my feelings were that this is easy to master. I decided not to replay it.
If you want a proof to that go to any site play on line you will observe that the winners are always the same guys (2 or 3).
