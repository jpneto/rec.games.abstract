Mister megamau,

I`m not disrespectful toward anyone but toward dumb and ignorant guys who are trying to look smart and erudite.
I participate to an average of 20 forums (different fields and interests) in mainly two languages (english and french).
I`m not native english spoken. So my english is not as higher as I wish.. My native language is french.
Here is how the forum works.
There are unsaid rules : 
- a newbie whatever what he say wrong or right is always a newbie. And sadly the moderators will always defend an " old member" against a newbie even if the old member is is blatantly wrong.
- in each forum you have a collective behaviour stopping anyone who is trying to change the forum. Collective behaviour treating this guy as troll almost like a terrorist. A freedom fighters are often treated as terrorist (Mandela Arafat and others were treated as terrorists). Silent him!!!! that is the slogan of the what I call the maffia.
- an old member can insult any newbie without fearing any punishment. In the contrary some moderators take the side of the old member.
- no charter define what is an insult. If someone is dumb or ignorant and you treat it as he or she is it is not an insult even in courts! 
- there is a collusion of interests mostly commercial one`s between the administration and some members (publishers and so on). You come with a free method or even a free game in some forums you will be harassed and provoked until you flee. Why? because they are selling methods or games.
I can give you a more longer list of the unsaid rules.
What you call conspiracy is just just how the maffia deny you the right to criticize.
There is a conspiracy against an idea exposing maffia lies.

If you can not understand that there are theoretical questions unuseful for the game design then you do not know what is the game design.
There are theoretical questions directly linked to the game design : what capturing mechanisms implies in terms of gameplay? has anyone debated such problem? noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what are the effects of non capturing mechanisms on the gameplay? and so on.
When you see people talking a lot about theoretical questions unrelated to the game design you quickly understand that those guys have nothing to say about the game design!

I'm also not a native English speaker, and I agree that makes more difficult to convey the tone of the messages. However calling people dumb and ignorant will get you banned from most forums. Attack the ideas, not the people !

I agree that forums may tend to create an "hive mind" in which alternative ideas are shunned. However if you keep it civil, different points of view are welcomed on BGG. Ralf Gering, Richard Moxham, Corey Clark, Quinn Swanger often have positions which differ from "mainstream BGG", but they didn't have issues with moderation.

It's not about new users vs old users. It' about polite (MS would say sugarcoated) vs offensive discussion.

I don't buy the commercial interest theory. BGG is full of threads on print&amp;play games and of rule-sets which use common equipment. And it's not like BGG has any commercial interest in supporting Nestor (which seems to attract your ire).

Regarding the "unuseful" theoretical discussion: if you don't like it, simply don't read it.
There is no rule that the discussion must be "useful for game design". Actually the forum is about "abstract games", not about "game design".

I had never attacked people and treat them as ignorant or dumb without proof.
I show their ignorance and their dumbness and if I call them ignorant or dumb is what they are! 
They attacked my mom my family in BGG without any reaction from the moderators nor the members.
In fact I do not read the unuseful theoretical questions (reading the first lines is sufficient to tell me that continuing to read is just waste of time).
I`m talking about the game design so anything else will have no interest for me.
If I were an abstract game seller then I will talk to you about that aspect..
If I were a player and only player then I will talk to you about selling...
Game design is not the core of the forum I admit it.
But no one will stop me talking about that aspect as long as it does not violate the charter.
Anyway you know what I have many interests in my life as creative guy that in the end I will really stop fighting against dumb people.
I will finish my life in some island without internet without any communication with anyone except my writings my poetry my mathematical research my art (painting sculpting) my discoveries ....

GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL.
I WILL NOT POST ANYMORE NOR HERE NOR IN ANY OTHER FORUM.
