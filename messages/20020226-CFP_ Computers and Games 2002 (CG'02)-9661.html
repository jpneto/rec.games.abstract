The biennial Computers and Games conference series is a major international
forum for researchers and developers interested in all aspects of artificial
intelligence in computer game-playing.  After two terms in Japan, the
conference will be held in North America for the first time.  Starting this
year, we are extending the scope to include commercial games such as sports
games and role-playing games.


TOPICS OF INTEREST:

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
 - the current state of game-playing programs,
 - new theoretical developments in game-related research,
 - general scientific contributions produced by the study of games,
 - AI techniques applied to games, such as machine learning, heuristic
search,
   knowledge representation, data-mining, and path finding,
 - social aspects of computer games,
 - cognitive research on how humans play games, and
 - issues related to networked games.


PAPER SUBMISSION:

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science Series (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs</a>).
All submitted papers are refereed. Accepted papers will be presented at the
conference and printed in the conference proceedings. Please visit the CG'02
