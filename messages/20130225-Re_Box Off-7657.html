Yes, increase the number of different kinds of stones (from 3 to 4). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's also rec.puzzles. You might try getting feedback there as well.

First off, the version I posted plays a slightly different game which I will fix of course.

I'm looking for effective ways of creating new puzzles, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  I don't think working backwards necessarily works since you at least have to make sure you're not creating any irregular gaps in the process that can't later accomodate a box off move (e..g. a 1x1 box, or a 2x1 "L").
