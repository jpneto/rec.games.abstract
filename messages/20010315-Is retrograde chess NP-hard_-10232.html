Apparently no theorems are known about the computational complexity of
retrograde analysis in chess (or other well-known abstract games.  I have
raised this question before but have a couple of new thoughts that maybe
someone can build on.

There are many ways to formalize the problem of retrograde analysis.  I am
taking the following as a working definition.

INSTANCE: Two generalized chess positions, a "start position" and an "end
position."

QUESTION: Does there exist a legal sequence of moves taking us from the
start position to the end position?

As a variation, we could also specify a bound on the number of moves.
It is not even immediately clear that this problem is in NP, because the
obvious "certificate" (i.e., the list of moves) could be exponential in
length.

Leaving that aside, can we show that the problem is NP-hard?  The thought
I have is to reduce 3-SAT to retrograde chess, along the following lines.
Given an instance of 3-SAT with n variables and m clauses, we design a
generalized chess position in which White has n "Capturers" (pieces or
pawns that will function as capturers of Black pieces) and Black has m
"Sacrificers" (pieces or pawns that will sacrifice themselves to the
White Capturers).  In the start position, all the Capturers and Sacrificers
will be present, and in the end position, the Capturers will still be there
but the Sacrificers will be gone.  The positions should be designed so that:

1. Each Capturer has two ways of getting from their start positions to
   their end positions, and it is not immediately clear which path they
   took.  Label the two paths "0" and "1."  Let's also require that the
   paths be disjoint.

2. For each Sacrificer, there are just three places where it could have
   been captured (call these places "altars").  Specifically, if the ith
   clause in the 3-SAT instance is (for example) x_r V ~x_s V x_t, then
   the three altars of the ith Sacrificer must appear on the "1" path of
   the rth Capturer, the "0" path of the sth Capturer, and the "1" path
   of the tth Capturer respectively.

However, I haven't been able to convert this rough outline into a specific
construction.  Can anyone else do so?
