I suggest you start keeping your promise to not post here again, if
you don't enjoy my observations, Mr. Steere.

And because of your gratutious ad hom, I'll repeat it again: To my
knowledge, no one has ever bothered writing a puzzle collection, or
even a strategy article, for one of Mark Steere's games. He can
convince people to implement his games, but works like these require a
community of actual players who like his games enough to go in-depth
on them - I'm not sure that exists.

Good luck recruiting them, Mark Steere. You'll have to turn on your
charm to a few more people. Slightly less time for Mark Steere to be
an ass, that's a good thing.
