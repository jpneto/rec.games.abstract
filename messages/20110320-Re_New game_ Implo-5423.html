Interesting. Will there always be a move available, and if not, then

I would think that when the board is all kings, no move is available?

Strange.  Like watching left-handed guitar players in their fingering.

Er... thanks? :-) Maybe you're referring to that feeling of obscure
familiarity... I've felt that, too.

Now, seriously, from its initial conception, Implo has undergone two
major changes: first the concept of promotion was introduced, then
placing stones of both colors was disallowed. The first one has
somewhat shortened the longest possible game, while the second one has
hopefully improved the game's strategic depth.

Interestingly, in the first draft of the game, without these changes,
the longest possible game could last exacly (n+1)*n/2 moves, n being
the number of points of the board. This formula is a short way of
performing the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. Thus, on a tiny 5x5 board, the
game could last up to 325 moves! And 45 moves, the average chess game,
on a 3x3 board!

I don't know if the intriguing Rive matches that, but it would be a
close-run thing, indeed. I would say that Rive's longest game, on an
equal-sized board, is shorter, but that the average game is a bit
longer.

As I've said, the current version of Implo is somewhat shorter, but
precise calculations are harder to make.
