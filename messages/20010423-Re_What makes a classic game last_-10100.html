As far as nine men's morris is concerned, the game has been solved.
The verdict: draw by repetition. There's a .pdf file on my website:

Actually, what impressed me most about the article was the mention of "Nine
Men's Morris enthusiasts" and "the current world champion."  This tells me
that people still do play the game seriously--which means that even after
developing a good deal of skill at the game, they still consider it
interesting.  The world champion, I'm guessing, has not personally "solved"
the game.  He doesn't go into a match expecting that he and his opponent
will make the best moves every time (and that therefore every game will be a
draw).  Rather, he presumes that he and his opponent will likely both make
mistakes--and the player who makes the fewest mistakes will win, unless his
opponent can force a draw.

I don't really know anything about the community of Morelles players,
or what sort of lengths the top players go to, to win their games.
I have heard several people complain about Gasser's results, since he
didn't use the exact "official" ruleset. So, it could be argued that
NMM hasn't been solved yet. But it would be only natural for strong
players to examine Gasser's results in detail. For example, Figure 14
in the article shows a position after White's 3rd move, only 5 tokens
are on the board. White just made a very natural-looking move,
threatening to form a Mill in two different ways. But the computer
says this is a losing move! I'm not sure if this would still be true
with the official ruleset (whatever that is), but chances are, most of
the generated analysis would still be valid.

I know strong Renju players spend a lot of time studying opening
theory, looking for new traps and surprises for their opponents.
The same is true in chess, of course. If a similar database were
made available in those games, you can bet the players would be
scrambling to access it.

A brute-force 18-ply search is, almost certainly, beyond human
capacity. But humans have learned a sense of positional judgement
that allows them to draw conclusions about a position based on
selective searches that can go considerably further than that.
So, the entire move tree would not necessarily have to be
memorized. I feel sure that any top player who has studied this
database, could regularly defeat anyone who hasn't. Of course,
I could be wrong.

Also, I'm not so sure that the whole thing COULDN'T be memorized.
Some people have astonishing memory capacity. I once heard of a
man who was "off the scale," in the sense that the people who
knew him for many years and gave him test after test, never once
saw him miss the slightest detail. That particular person did
seem to have some difficulty with abstract concepts, however.
So, he might have had difficulty even understanding the rules of
the game (although he could have recited the rules and the
entire database forwards and backwards). Perhaps someone
with a comparable capacity, might have just enough abstract reasoning
ability to play the game. That person could probably become
the World Champion. Bleaugh.

So, I can see a "trivial" game like tic-tac-toe being dead.  Once you
realize you can't lose unless you blunder, and you see how easy it is to
avoid blundering, your interest in the game is going to fall off completely.

But a non-trivial game like NMM can continue to be interesting when humans
play each other (without the assistance of computers).  Or when a computer
AI can be dumbed down enough to make the occasional blunder.

Of course, it depends on the individual. Many people play and enjoy
Connexxions a.k.a. Gale a.k.a. Bridgit, even though a simple winning
strategy has been found. Their (presumed) ignorance doesn't stop them
from finding the game interesting.

What would you think if Twixt were solved?  Would it make any difference to
you if some computer program proved that you can't lose if you don't
blunder?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well proving that I can't lose is one thing, showing how is another.
I would probably study that opening database extensively, delight in
the discoveries made, and ultimately get bored when my opponents use
the same db against me. But at least Twixt has a natural refuge- we
can make the board bigger. 36x36, now that's a REAL game... :-)
