It sounds like you're missing the "transposition cache"

I'd agree with that.  It seems best to evaluate a large chunk of the
game offline and store it in a table.

I would tend to view the "table of solutions from recent several weeks"
and "cache of solutions from recent several seconds" as
separate objectives with separate heuristics that may or may not
use same data format.

   But the bottom line is still that the program has to, at some point,
look at 9! things ...

By " 9! " I think you're referring to the permutations of
{A,B,C,...,H,I}.
But the opening A-B-C leads to the same position as C-B-A
(they <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>transpose<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> into each other: that's why we speak of
"transposition cache") and only one of these openings need be
considered.  Stated differently, the number of positions reached
in your example is 2^9 not 9!, right?  Do I misunderstand?

   As for James' point about breadth-first search: Yeah, I actually
wanted to do that ... but I couldn't figure out how to make it work, in the
few hours I spent halfheartedly thinking about it....

It's not really my field, but I think a good starting point would
be "Conspiracy Numbers" or Victor Allis' related algorithm.
I did a Google search just now and clicked to get
"Solving the Game of Checkers"
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/schaeffer.pdf">http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/schaeffer.pdf</a>
which seems very interesting article, though wide-ranging rather
than much about Allis' algorithm.  (I was delighted to see the
first item in "References" for this article I picked almost at
random.  :-)

I think game-tree exploration and related work is far more
interesting than most programming problems.
Have fun!!
