This new game is based on the idea of fertility. 
Each player has 3 kind of pieces :
- males (3)  
- females (3) 
- off-springs (the number will depend on the size of the board)

Each player has pieces of the same color (blue versus red for example)

Hex Board : 11x11

Blue (or red) has then 3 males, 3 females and 55 off-springs

Rules :

The board start empty 
Blue start first
On his turn a player drop one piece on an empty hex case : either a male, either female, either an off-spring.
And players alternate
There game ends when all the board is full
Then start the score counting :
The red begins the counting by linking a male to some female and removing all the off-springs connecting the chosen male and the chosen female. He must do it for the 3 males and the 3 females. He must chose the longest path possible but he must keep in mind the order of removing the off-springs. Changing the order could disrupt some connections. This phase is the hardest one. His score will be equal to the removed off-springs.
Blue player has to do the same counting process.
The males and females are not counted.

The player with the best score wins the game.

Good luck!

I will post the diagrams later with the counting process.

Once the game is finished each player has to do its best to find the best order of removing the off-springs leading to the best score.
