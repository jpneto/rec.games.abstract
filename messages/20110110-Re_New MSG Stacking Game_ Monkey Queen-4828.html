I think having fewer rules is clearer, unless you have
a specific reason for awarding a draw by stalemate.

I couldn't agree more.  The novelty of the stalemate was already giving way
to more of a "what the hell was I thinking?" sensation.  I'll drop the
stalemate and simplify the rule sheet tomorrow.  Thanks for the feedback.

I've read through it this morning and mindful of Michael's remarks it
looks great, congrats :)
Makes me wonder what your reservations regarding "gameplay-centric
design" were in the first place. Simplifying the rules as suggested
seems all there's left to iron out the last wrinkle. It doesn't seem
to hard to implement at mindsports either, given the amount of
stacking games we already feature. I'll ask Ed if he has a mind and
the time to do it. It would make a nice addition to mindsports
irrespective of the contest.

I've given Soar an external thread to, and maybe Cameron should do the
same for Stax. I've also started a "direct links to the entries only"
thread.
