You can define a "step" in playing ability

A problem with this definition is that a set
of several games, in any game where results
are variable (including chess and go, because
even if one player is better than another,
he may sometimes lose), will reduce the effect
of chance and increase the number of levels.

Gerry, if I understand you what you're saying, then I respectfully
disagree.

Yes, the more games you play, the better chance the stronger player will
have to prove his superiority.  This is obvious since we all know a one
game match by itself means almost nothing.  But even if two players
play, for example, a 1,000 game match, a player "one step up" in playing
ability will still only win about 75% of the games.  That's what it
means to be one step up... he's going to win about 75% of the time.  In
fact, the more games played in this match or series, the closer to the
actual 75% percentage we will get.

Yes, but if that 1000-game match consists of 10 games of 
"best-of-a hundred-chess", the stronger player will almost certainly win 
them all.

In other words, a hundred-game chess match has many more steps of 
playing ability than a single chess game.
