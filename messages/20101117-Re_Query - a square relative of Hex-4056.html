his modern classic that's brought joy to thousands because the Minister of
Mediocrity thinks it's ugly??  Why should Freeling have to take your shit,
Minister of Mediocrity????

If I understand Freeling's objection, it wasn't that you insulted him.  It
was that you made an absurd, derogatory claim about his game, and then ran
off without explaining yourself.  He was offended by your cowardice, as were
we all, not your crass insult.

Bill, when you run out on your own topic like that, you leave people
guessing.  You also did that with your Christmas Tree Y.  Still unanswered
group question to Bill Taylor: "Why are you congratulating yourself for a
game that's 100% isomorphic to Y?  Basically Y with a decorative fringe."

Possible Bill Taylor answers, had he not suddenly run out on his own topic:

1. "Sorry guys, you're right.  I don't know what I was thinking, lol  Do you
mind if we move past this shit?"

Sure Bill, no problem.  Thanks for your honesty.

2. "No, you guys totally missed the point.  Of course Christmas Tree Y is
isomorphic to Y, lol.  The point I was trying to make was..."

Yes, Bill?

3. "What??  You don't see how Christmas Tree Y is different from ordinary
Y??  What's wrong with you people..."

Rofl, Bill.

Bill, we all know exactly what you did and exactly why you did it.  You
walked up behind the new guy with a boner sticking out of your pants and
tapped him on the shoulder.  Only instead of cordially bending over and
spreading his butt cheeks for you, Freeling spun around a delivered a swift
knee to your groin!

Now you come limping back two days later with a bent dick and a tale of woe.
Woeful fucking Willy!!

Well.  With an attitude like that, no wonder you're happy
