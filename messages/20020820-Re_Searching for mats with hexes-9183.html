  I am not sure if this is what you want but it might help.  In my local
  shopping mall, they do printout of photographs onto t-shirts and onto
  computer mouse pads.  Maybe if you are desparate you could draw up your
  design (hex pattern) and ask them to print it on a t-shirt and then cut it
  out or ask them to print it on a towel of the size you need or print it
  on a cloth that you provide.   You might also try tie-dye.  What you can
  do is melt wax and "paint" it onto a piece of cloth everywhere where you
  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> wish the dye to go.  Then dip the cloth into a large kettle or
  pan of dye and then after it dries you can place the cloth between
  newspaper and iron out the wax.  I suggest this last method because it
  allows you to do some real funky and neat stuff; try gently crumbling
  the cloth before you dip it and you get a "lightening" effect!  or what
  you could do is dip it first without wax and then wax the cloth and
  crumble it then dip it in bleach! (wear gloves) and you get a reverse
  lightening effect.  experiment and have fun!  :-)
