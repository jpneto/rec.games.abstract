How about no backwards moves?  Or, You must push at least one marble
within some number of moves or else loose a marble.  Maybe, you can
play with a third set of marbles that are split between the two
players.  Either player can use them to push, but they don't count
toward a win if they're pushed off.  That would make the board a bit
tighter like with three players.  I've noticed three player games are
much more agressive.
