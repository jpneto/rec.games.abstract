Thanks!  That looks very nice (except the only-runs-on-Linux part,
but I suppose that can hardly be helped, for such a graphics-intensive
application as board games).  I will definitely check it out.

I wouldn't consider board games "graphics-intensive"; certainly not in

No; but the graphic and UI design is most of the raison d'etre for the game,
and it's what the programmer spends most of his time on [especially if the
search tree code is already supplied :) ].  Contrast to I/O-intensive apps or
algorithm-intensive apps.

Yes, a programmer will spend a lot of time on that.  But this fact has
nothing to do with the claim "only-runs-on-Linux part, but I suppose that
can hardly be helped".  Is there something about linux that makes GUI
programming easier than on other platforms?  I seriously doubt it.  You've
got a mouse and a window with colored pixels in it.  Same as every other
platform these days.  Gtk allows you to supply images of your game's
components.  Is there some image standard on linux that's not on other
platforms?  I'm trying to see what there possibly could be about the graphic
nature of a board game that demands linux and excludes other platforms.  If
you know what it is, please tell me.

What I originally thought your statement of graphics-intensiveness meant was
that the code to manipulate pixels on the screen must be tied, in a
platform-dependent way, to the video hardware.  From what I can tell at the
gtkboard site, and from what I know from my own experience programming both
fast-action video games and slow-action puzzle/games, there's no <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>technical<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
reason that a project like gtkboard should be tied to one architecture or
OS.

That it is tied to linux seems to be the preference of the guy running the
show, and if that's convenient for him that's certainly his prerogative.  I
don't mean to be ragging on that choice.  My only contention was with your
claim that it "can hardly be helped".  That's simply not true.  I could be
helped fairly easily, if that's one of the project's goals.
