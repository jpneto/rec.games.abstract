Ok, maybe I was confusing zugzwang with tempo or something else.  Zugzwang does seem to have a particular definition limiting it to the negative.  But even with zugzwang, if it weren't your turn, you wouldn't be forced to make an unfavorable move.

What I was getting at was, "little sub-games of Nim cropping up throughout play."  If there's a word for this, great.  If there isn't there ought to be.
