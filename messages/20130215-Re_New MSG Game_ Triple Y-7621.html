The Y principle works perfectly well on any board shape, not just the triangle and the hexagon.  The three perimeter delineating cells need not be vertices.  And said delineator cells need not be spaced equidistantly.  The three delineator cells could be any three perimeter cells separated by at least one perimeter cell respectively.  



For example, on a base 7 hexagon, select five contiguous, non-vertex perimeter cells, labeling them 1 through 5 consecutively.  Call cells 1, 3, and 5 delineator cells.  Call cells 2 and 4 sides.  And call all the remaining perimeter cells the third side.  This arrangement of delineator cells and sides would be perfectly suitable for Y play.



For Triple Y, a hexagonal board is used.  Label any vertex with a 1 and, proceeding around the perimeter either clockwise or counter-clockwise, label the remaining five vertices 2 through 6 consecutively.  Three sets of delineator cells are used to define three distinct games of Y: Vertices 1, 2, 3; vertices 3, 4, 5; and vertices 5, 6, 1.



The three games of Y so defined are played simultaneously.  The object is to win at least two of them.



Design Notes



As with Redstone, I thought of Triple Y while driving home at night after a vigorous but very relaxing 2 hour massage from a young, ape strong Chinese lady.  It really clears the cobwebs.
