There is also evidence that continual work is very bad for the bright, and that

do it, I would like to remove anyone who would consider giving someone who

A digression from the main topic.

We hear a lot that one of the reasons that education is in such a crisis is that the
low salaries keep good teachers out of the profession.  I have on occasion asked if
there's a list of teachers that would be replaced if higher salaries brought better
teachers into the system.  All I get is blank stares.

But why subject them to the junk?  Even the moderately good ones can learn
mathematics faster without it, and then learn the manipulative material twice as
fast,
because they will understand what they are doing.

        So we (pretty much) require students to show

they can do at least a little work before allowing them to take a math course
that will require them to think.  (Have to work before you can think?)

This is exactly the opposite.  We can teach abstract mathematics, involving
thinking, to children who can just read.  Every year in the present schools serves
to stultify the innate ability to think abstractly.

I wasn't defending it, I was explaining it.  I forgot to add &lt;/+sarcasm&gt;.  Although I
wonder how much I (or you) would like to teach an analysis class full of lazy bums.
(I don't consider wanting to minimize work lazy.  That's smart.  I do consider
refusing to do the necessary work lazy.)

My (unofficial) undergraduate advisor thought that everyone should take algebra as
their first undergraduate course.  That way, the students are starting over and don't
stumble over their preconceived notions.  But maybe, as an algebraic number theorist,
he had a higher regard for algebra than analysis.  (Calculus, in his opinion, is for
engineers, not mathematicians.)

And I doubt that abstract reasoning is inhibited by computation.  Children (and
adults too, for that matter) are pretty resilient.  It takes lots and lots of
bad teaching to undo our natural desires.  And very, very lots to completely
bury them.

Another digression:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Teaching reading by the whole word method, besides wasting years, seems to have
reduced or even destroyed the ability of a substantial proportion of children to
use the alphabet to pronounce words.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My siblings and I learned to read by "the whole word method" (also called "see and
say").  So did my younger son.  Possibly my other children as well, and I'm certain
it had a great influence on them.

The evidence (as explained to me:  I am not an expert on language acquisition) is
that "self-taught" readers overwhelmingly use the whole word method.  You just read
to the children a lot and suddenly they read.  Frankly, speaking works the same way
(in my experience).

However, it isn't really a method.  As you say, it is a terrible way to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>teach<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
reading.  Strangely, this is one of the few instances where pedagogical orthodoxy
followed research.  Studies showed that people who learned to read by the "whole word
method" were better readers than those who learned by "the phonics method".  So "the
educational establishment" jumped to the conclusion that the method was better.
However, as I indicated above, the real reason was that self-taught readers were
"whole word" readers and also (and I don't believe coincidentally) better readers.
Now that we have adults who were taught by the "whole word method" (what idiot came
up with that phrase, anyway?) we realize its shortcomings.

Back to main topic.

Maybe your experience differs from mine, but I have found very few people who can't
think abstractly.  Even after 13 or 17 or even 23 years of the American educational
system.  What I do find is very many people who <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>won't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Or, if they do, they won't
share their thoughts.
