... according to Ravensburg which is selling the game since1907 (with these
rules!).
Ravensburg has gained the merit to keep Reversi alive in Germany where it
has remained a very popular game all the time while it sank in its Victorian
Vaterland England in oblivion.

Another difference: each player has exactly 32 discs. Each player has to
flip over (an) opponent's piece(s) each move. If a player can't play, he
doesn't play, if he can, he must play. If both players can't play, either
because they have played all their 32 pieces or because they can't turn any
opponent's pieces upside down, the game is over.

BTW, the pieces were originally Blue and Yellow (Blue starts). Ravensburg
changed the colors in 1907 to Green and Red (Green starts).
