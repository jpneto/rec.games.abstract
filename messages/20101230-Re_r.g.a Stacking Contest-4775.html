Hi fizzy,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The other thing I don't like is the memory factor.  
In fact, it takes it out of my definiton of perfect information
game if you must rely on memory to know the
properties of the covered pieces.  A rule allowing free
examination of covered pieces would be good, but also somewhat
awkward.  A physical design where you can see the moves of all the
pieces in the stack, perhaps something like Octi, would be something
to consider.

Good point! Nestor and I got onto this topic yesterday when he
mentioned that cutting the pointers as holes in the pieces would be
cheaper than just engraving them. An added benefit of this would be
that players could look at stacks from directly above through the
holes in the pieces to see (partially) what was underneath.

This is similar in principle to the punch cards that were used to
teach computing many years ago: you might see a hole through a stack
of cards, but you had to actually stick a pin in there to see which
cards dropped and which held. This would reduce the memory aspect and
might be a cute mechanism.

When you mention Octi are you referring to slots that the players
stick pointers in? I fear that would make things too fiddly.

Regards,
Cameron
