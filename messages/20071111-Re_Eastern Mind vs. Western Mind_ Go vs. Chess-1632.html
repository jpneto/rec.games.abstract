Maybe the question or hypothesis is wrong, but
hardly the "most stupid thing anyone had heard" (using "stupidest"
rather than "most stupid" might be argued to be more stupid).

There's nothing wrong with "stupidest" - at least, not on my side of the
Atlantic (see Fowler's Modern English Usage, The Oxford Companion to the
English Language, et al.). Same applies to several other disyllabic
adjectives, one of the commonest being... er ... common.

There's no record of dice being used in Indian Chess - at least, not in
the two-player game. The first mention of four-handed dice Chess occurs
in an early 12th-century Sanskrit document, where it is treated as a
minor variant. See also Murray, A History of Chess, p.48. (Eales, in
Chess: The History of a Game, is more ambivalent, but offers no evidence
for the existence of a two-handed dice Chess.)

I got my information on this from book, "The Immortal Game" that
stated the Muslims got the game from the Indians, and then changed the
game removing the random element.  Anyhow, the path of development is
still correct, even if the book, "The Immortal Game" was incorrect
about the dice assessment.  It may be possible that Muslims saw the
game in its dice version and removed it.
