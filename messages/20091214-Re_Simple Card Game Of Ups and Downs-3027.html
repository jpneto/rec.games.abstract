Important: When the players are placing their cards in the central
pile, they MUST place them in the order they originally ordered them,
from left to right in their hand (or from top to bottom in their own
face-down card pile).

This is a card game for two players.

Start with a deck of 2n cards labeled 1 through 2n, one distinct
number per card. (n is some number, such as 10.)

Shuffle the deck, and deal n cards to each player.

Each player secretly arranges their n cards in any order they choose.

The players then, without further arranging their cards, take turns
alternately placing cards, in order, face-up onto a common pile
between the players.

If a card placed in the central pile is greater in numerical value
than the last card placed down by the previous player, then player 1
gets a point.

If a card placed in the central pile is smaller in numerical value
than the last card placed down by the previous player, then player 2
gets a point.

Continue until all 2n cards have been placed in the central pile.

The player with the greatest number of points wins.

-

Variation: Play with a standard deck of 52 cards. (No jokers.)
(Therefore, in this case, n = 26. Ace =1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King
= 13.)


Same rules as before, but if a card is of the same value as the
previous card, then player 1 gets a point if the newly placed card is
of a red suit (hearts or diamonds), and player 2 gets a point if the
newly placed card is of a black suit (ace or clubs).



Is this game unoriginal? It sounds familiar, maybe just because it is
so simple.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
