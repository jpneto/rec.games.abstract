Not "nomic" as such I guess, but we play "nomic" by starting with
some arbitrary game (usually a card-game), then adding
"winner-makes-a-rule" and "winner-makes-a-rule rule is immutable".

Starting game could be poker, or even "highest-card-wins".

Some friends and I have over the past few years developed a game we call
'Follow Calvin', with many of the rules relating somewhat to the comic
strip by Bill Watterson.  Its inspiration is Calvin Ball, that game where
the rules are constantly changing.

It was originally conceived as a cross between Blind Baseball poker and
Follow the Queen (Hence, 'Follow Calvin' (a Calvin card has been introduced)),
with the additional stipulation that the dealer must make a rule before he
deals.

The evolution of the game is rather interesting, with the earlier rules 
tending to be completely new rules or concepts, but lately tending towards
minor modifications or extensions of existing rules.  Now we are lucky to 
get one good new rule in a 10-13 hands (an afternoon of playing).

If anyone is interested in hearing more about the game itself or discussing
its development, please contact me.  I've been thinking for a while of 
putting together a set of minimal rules which would be needed to keep the
flavour of the game, along with suggestions of rules we've tried which 
work and which don't.  If there is enough interest I might do so.
