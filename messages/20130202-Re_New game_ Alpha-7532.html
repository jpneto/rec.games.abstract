Certainly not with the either color option. On the face of it, it seems to serve the object flawlessly.

The tie-rule is funny but that doesn't justify it. It interferes somewhat with the pie-rule at the start - that is supposed to solve unbalance. Dictating this solution for a draw doesn't quite agree with me I fear. I'd rather accept the possibility of a draw, though I'm aware of the controversy regarding draws of course, so there's no need to explain why I'm wrong ;-)

Yeah, there's no need to get into that old discussion once again. :)



If ties are won by the first player, he'll have to chose a slightly worse first move, and the number of available bad first moves is usually quite low already. Also, more often than not, he'll have one stone more than the opponent in the final position, so awarding ties to the latter should be a fair countermeasure.

Elaborate explanations are implicitly suspect ;-) I feel one shouldn't have to consider which side of a tie one might be, eventually, when making a first move. The disconnect between the two is such that it isn't weighable if the margin is as small as it would appears. That is not insignificantly small, as far as I can see, but neither does it seem to be problematicly large.
