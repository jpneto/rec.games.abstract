For the last week or so I have been tilting at a windmill, &lt;G&gt;.  I am
here, at rec.games.abstract, to ask if anyone knows of any sites on-
line, or search terms that might work better, or individuals, who
might be able to assist me?

I am searching for information to prove (or not) the proposition that
the game "Fizzbin", from the 1968 Star Trek episode "A Piece of the
Action", is the first occurrence of a game with a "conditional
modifier" rule set.  That is, a game with rules where conditions
OUTSIDE the game, modify the play (see also Dragon Poker definition
below).

There is a discussion going on at Wiki about the Fizzbin article
there, and my husband and I have come to the conclusion that Fizzbin
is the genesis of a new class of games, where the rules are modified
by external conditions (is it Tuesday, is it dark outside, etc.)
(These rule sets also appear to be extremely complex.)  My husband has
done rather a lot of research on historic (esp Medieval to early
Renaissance) card games at various times, and is quite convinced that
he's seen no evidence for malleable-rule games (to the extent of
Fizzbin, anyway) before the Star Trek episode.  And there are now
quite a few!

I wrote, in the Wiki discussion:  "Fizzbin (1968) may be the first
example of a "conditional modifier" card game -- one in which the
allowable play may be changed by external factors ... Have not YET
been able to find anything else on-line on the origin of "modifier
card game". Fizzbin is older than Dungeons and Dragons (rules first
published in 1974); Asprin's Dragon Poker and Pratchett's Cripple Mr.
Onion may be spoofs of the Fizzbin concept. Fizzbin is certainly older
than Mornington Crescent. Calvin and Hobbes "calvinball" game is an
example of a non-card game which is based entirely on the "conditional
modifier" concept. IF Fizzbin is the source of this concept, it
represents the genesis of a whole new class of games. This seems
sufficient to retain the article as is, without merging or
redirecting. Although we agree it would benefit from editing to
include the influences we think exist. Perhaps what is really needed
is an article on "Conditional modifier games"! (What brought me to
this discussion was an allusion to the game in a political blog; it's
part of the culture. I have so far found the term used as an adjective
relative to religious, programming, mathematical and astrophysical
discussions online -- and I'm obsessing about still looking.)"

The following definition is from the Wiki article on Dragon poker,
from Robert Asprin's MythAdventures universe:

"the concept of conditional modifiers. These are a standard set of
rules that, depending on the day, weather, number of people playing,
and other factors, determines what cards are wild, what cards are
"dead" (unusable), and other subtle changes in how the game is played.
In the books, the rules delineating conditional modifiers vary as
well, depending on the dimension where the game is being played. It is
not known if there exists a set or rules for modifiers that applies to
Earth's dimension, nor, if they exist, what they are.
If a player makes a mistake in his interpretation of the current
hand's conditional modifiers, so that he undervalues his own hand, the
opponent is not required to point out the error (although he is not
forbidden from doing so, either)."

I have found rather a large number of games like this (see the list at
the Mornington Crescent Wiki article) -- but they all appear to post-
date the Fizzbin episode.  

I have not had much luck finding information on the Google by
searching terms such as "modifier games", "conditional modifier games"
etc.  in the context of the definition above.  Most references I have
been able to find refer to modern games which include cards that
modify the play (i.e. Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.)   I have not been able to find
much in the way of history of (card) games invented in the 20th
century.  I haven't been able to find much, if anything, on ??? the
philosophy ?? of game play, where I might expect discussions of rule
sets that are highly malleable.  (i.e. the board game Nomic, which is
apparently designed specifically with the main object of the game
being to change the rules!)  I have found that the writers and
director of the Star Trek episode have all passed on by now, so
there's not much chance of settling this at the source.


Thanks VERY much for your time and any assistance!
