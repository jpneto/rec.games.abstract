Yes, I was asking about Score 4.

Rather then a program, I was looking for some advice on playing. For
instance, is making multiple threats the key? Do you have to count, as in
Connect 4, the number of moves remaining to know if you can force the
opponent to play in that column he doesn't want to, etc.

What I found to be the key to winning the game is blocking off moves for
the other player so that they eventually are forced to make a move which
lets you complete a 4 in a row. Parity is important when when you are
forced to fill in columns that your opponent can't move in. If you only
have even parity ones left you will have to keep filling them in until
you are forced to make a losing move.

You still have to be careful about forks, but it seemed that they were
relatively easy to prevent, so that games wouldn't be decided by them.
