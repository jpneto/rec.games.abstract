<br>You simply haven't considered the difficulties in implementing the
<br>cheating scheme that Mr. Richerby proposes in chess.
<br>
<br>Imagine that I have an agreement with Mr. Richerby (both of us
<br>being dishonorable people) so that whenever we reach a
<br>drawn position, we agree to flip a coin and the loser throws
<br>the game.
<br>
<br>We reach such a position, implement our plan, and I lose the toss.
<br>Both of us are near the top of the tournament, so it is going to cost
<br>me prize money today when I lose on purpose. Sure, he will gain
<br>a lot more than I lose, but that does me no good today.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Have you considered the remote possibility that the two players will split the 
prize money right down the middle?
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>I have. Yes. There are far better ways to cheat than the idiotic
<br>one suggested by Mr. Richerby, I don't deny. For example,
<br>instead of tossing a coin in a drawn position, they could just
<br>have a prearranged agreement to lose in alternate games.
<br>
<br>As to your suggestion, an agreement to split the total prize might
<br>not make sense, because one of of us was more likely to win
<br>money in the first place, or the monetary value of the win is not
<br>known exactly since it will depend on how we do in other games.
<br>
<br>In any case, if you are talking about multiple parties collaborating
<br>to manipulate results and increase their prizes, that is a strategy
<br>that would be effective <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>today<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, with the existing scoriing. Is there
<br>evidence of this being a widespread practice? Not as far as I know.
<br>
<br>I will grant that if we held a double round robin tournament with anti-draw
<br>scoring, alternating losses would be fairly easy to implement, since
<br>the benefit would be near term and faking a loss from the starting
<br>position is easier than faking one from a drawn position. But the
<br>tournament organizers can easily avoid that. Note that this cheating
<br>method would be effective in many soccer leagues, but I've never heard
<br>of it being implemented there, either.
