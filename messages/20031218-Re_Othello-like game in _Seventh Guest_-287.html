A student here recently lent me a computer game (from a few years back)
entitled "Seventh Guest". The player moves from room to room in a
creepy house solving various puzzles. One of the puzzles is a game
which you play against an unseen opponent. I wonder if anyone has
done an analysis of this game?

It's Othello-like: Two players, each initially having tokens at a pair
of opposite corners of a 7x7 checkerboard. Players take turns placing
their tokens on the board's squares until all the playing places are
filled; the winner is the player controlling the greatest number of
squares when the game is over.

A player's move consists of moving a token from position (x,y) to
position (x',y'), where
   That player has a token at position (x,y)
   Position (x', y') is vacant
   | x - x' | &lt; 3,  and likewise | y - y'| &lt; 3
(If a player has no valid moves, s/he forfeits that turn and play
passes to the opponent.)

When the player moves the token, several changes take place:
   The player now has a token at position (x', y')
   Position (x,y) is now vacant IF  |x-x'| = 2  OR |y-y'| = 2
   Any opponent's token at (x'', y'') is replaced by this player's token
     there, if  | x' - x'' | &lt; 2  and | y' - y'' | &lt; 2.

This is the game of Attaxx (not sure of the spelling). In some versions,
some squares are blocked out. There's also a hexagonal version, called Hexx.
