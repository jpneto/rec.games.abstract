SW Horse #12 (Last)

Red S7+1 variation vs Black SW Horse

Instead of using the chained Horse as in posting #10 and #11, Red uses the
less aggressive but more subtle 7th Horse variation.

1   C25   H2+3
2   H2+3  C86
3   R1+1  H8+7
4   R14   R98
5   S7+1  A4+5  The correct reply. If Black play S7+1?; S7+1! S3+1; C87
Black in danger of losing a piece.

6   H8+7  S7+1
7   C89   C2+2
8   R4+5  H7+8
9   R98   C21
10  R4-2  H8+7
11  C9+3  S1+1 
12  C56   E3+5 (See diagram)

An almost symmetrical positions for both sides with each of their Horses
active. On the whole, Red still has a slight advantage since its two Rooks
are brought into play.

Option 1
13  R8+6   R12
14  R87    R2+6
15  H7+6   R24
16  A4+5   S5+1!
17  H6-4   S5+1!
18  R45    R8+8  Red gains two soldiers but Black has opportunities in the
counter attack.

Option 2
13  H7+6   R8+8
14  A6+5   S1+1
15  S9+1   R1+5
16  H6+7   R1-2
17  C67    R87
18  E7+5   C68
19  R4+4! If Red play R42? C87 Black seizes the initiative in attack; By
attacking Black's elephant, Red still retains the advantage of moving first.
    
19  ...   H3-4
Overall, Red still has a slight advantage over Black. Outcome of the game
will depend on the middle and end game skills of both sides.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have discussed the Same Direction Cannon opening (SD Cannon; 7 posts) and 
the Sandwiched Horse opening (SW Horse; 12 posts) in some details, though
these are by no means exhaustive. There are still many sub-variations and
sub-sub-variations to the ones I mentioned. Nevertheless, I have tried to
include the major variations in these openings, as far as possible. The
openings that I have introduced are also quite recent and up-to-date. If any
of you by chance have copies of recent years' (90s-) China National Open,
you would not have much difficulties in understanding these openings as some
of these are the same as what I have discussed.

For Xiangqi beginners, my advice is: Try to play the central cannon opening
when playing Red and the SD cannon/SW Horse when playing Black. It is only
after we have familiarised ourselves with these openings shall we attempt to
play more subtle openings such as E3+5, S7+1, C26 or C24. The chained Horse
central cannon opening is the most direct, aggressive and the most
fundamental opening one must be familiar with before we shall attempt
anything else.

With that, I conclude my discussions on opening theory. Perhaps in future
postings, I shall concentrate more on the tactical aspects of Xiangqi (?)
since without sufficient knowledge of tactics and strategies, a player would
be lost once the moves are played outside the books :)
