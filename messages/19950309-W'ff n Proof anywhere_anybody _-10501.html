I apologize if I mangeled the spelling.  I haven't really played it
much, and I don't have a set.  I found the book (as far as I got
through it) fascinating.  If there is a way to aquire a set, I would
like to hear about it.

Are there any players of this game around?

BTW, is there a better place to ask about this?  I seem to remember a
(slightly) more mathematical forum somewhere, but it could be a
figment of my imagination.

I haven't been reading this group real regularly, I apologize if this
has been mentioned recently.
