I have only scanned over most of it, but I can't superficially see
anything that would rule out a lot of non-abstract games with a clear theme.

Beyond that, I would ask "what is the point of this document?".  Is
there anything to gain from "standardising" ASGs in such a manner, and
if so what and for whom?  In a book (i.e., David Parlett's Oxford
History of Board Games) it makes sense to categorise things as it allows
a degree of structure to the document as a whole, but beyond allowing a
structural narrative is it particularly useful to categorise in these
ways?  I don't play Go because it's a territory game with sequential
turns and piece capture, I play it because it's good and I like it.  The
same reasons I play the utterly different game of Bezique

It comes across as a document to formally write down what we already
know, which may or may not be a Good Thing.  There are times when that's
handy, but there are times when you spend a lot of time writing down
something and there's not much point because we already know it.  Are
you sure you're in the former category and not the latter?  Perhaps the
case that something much simpler would suit your purpose, something
pointing out it's a mental exercise with no pretensions to recreate or
simulate (or even bear some superficial resemblance to) any particular
strand of reality, and so on.

Pete.
