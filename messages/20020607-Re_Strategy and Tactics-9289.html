Well, it seems even more "artificial" to me to create an arbitrary
distinction between "sacrifices which recover material equality before
the other player is checkmated" and "sacrifices which lead to
checkmating the other player without ever achieving material equality".
To say that the process of finding one sort of sacrifice is
fundamentally different than the process of finding the other sort of
sacrifice just seems wrong, to me.

You're the one who (earlier) said that sound sacrifices always recover thier
material. No. Sound sacrifices always help attain the ultimate objective (a win
or draw). Sometimes that's by regaining material, sometimes it's not.
"[M]aterial equality" is not the point. Material is just the most obvious
'positional' consideration, not something apart from positional chess. A
sacrifice either improves your position or it doesn't.
