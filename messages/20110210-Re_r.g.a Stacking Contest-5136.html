I used to play postal games with Wayne years ago, some of his
inventions and some of mine.  And he published some Hex variants of
mine in Games Magazine.  But it's been a long time, and as a non-
competitor, I don't know if my request would be of any value.  Mark,
email me privately and send me Wayne's current email address and I
will ask him to judge, if that is the will of the forum.  Other
possible judges with whom I had some contact in the past might include
John McCallion and Robin King, both of whom review games for Games
Magazine, or at least they did at one time, and both are exceptionally
astute gamers.  They both turned cold shoulders to an early attempt of
mine that I showed them once at a games party, and they were right.
