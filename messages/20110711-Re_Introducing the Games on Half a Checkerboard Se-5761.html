And I can't say I've ever been impressed with Hutnik, going
back to his efforts to establish IAGO-Chess and use it to co-opt every
chess variant in the world, and his collection of 32 derivative games
for half a checkerboard didn't change my mind, being pretty much in
the same vein.

Well, how about I strengthen that not impressed by turning it into
complete and total utter disrespect to the extent you think I am the
worst person on the planet, and ever existed, for creating W.W.B:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/99918/w-w-b">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/99918/w-w-b</a>

Not being impressed with someone is on the boring side.  It really
needs to be thrown into the utter contempt level to actually be
worthwhile.  As low of an opinion you have of me, W.W.B should drive
it to be much, much lower.

Went to the link you provided, and found that I never commented on
W.W.B. so I have to assume that you are suffering from a persecution
complex, or at the very least you are a huge crybaby.  Before this
post, I was merely unimpressed with your game invention efforts and
annoyed with IAGO Chess.  Utter contempt is something I feel for very
few people in this world which previously did not include you, but at
your request I will now reconsider.
