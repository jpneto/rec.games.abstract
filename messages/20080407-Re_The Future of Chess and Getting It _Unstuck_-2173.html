That's an interesting thought. Had I been interested in FIDE rules
at the time I suspect that I would not have liked the change, and
as it turns out, FIDE ended up not liking it either.

I'm surprised to hear that. I would tend to have thought that, if it
was theoretically possible to win in a certain position, and only the
50-move rule was standing between you and the win, then, since the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>intent<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the 50-move rule was, presumably, only to force a draw
where players would otherwise be endlessly moving aimlessly... this is
a change most Chess players would have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>demanded<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> if FIDE had shown no

I like the general idea of addressing that, but not the change they 
choose.  If I were to make any change at all I would have simply made 
the 50-move rule a 75-move rule, choosing simplicity of the ruleset 
over convenience of the players.  That being said, I would still 
favor keeping an existing imperfect rule unless the problem being 
addressed was a lot larger that this one was.

I once played a game where I got into a weird position where neither
side could win, and the 50-move rule would normally end it, but my
opponent had a pawn in the rook file that he was able to push every
49 moves without changing the chances of winning.  It was 3 or 4 moves
away from being blocked by one of my pawns.  He pushed it once, but by 
the time he wanted to push it again I had walked my pawn forward and
blocked it.  This was a game at work, so we had no arbiter or TD to
decide that he wasn't trying to win.  The hundred moves went by pretty 
quickly once I had the pattern figured out -- faster for me than for 
him, because I was trying to get him to draw by repetition of position
and he was trying to avoid it, which is more work.

For those who don't know what we are talking about, a recap:

 In the FIDE Laws of Chess, published in 1984 and 1988, the 50-move
 rule was extended to 75 moves for the following positions:

 King + Rook + Bishop against King + Rook;
 King + 2 Knights against King + pawn;
 King + Queen + pawn one square from promotion against King + Queen;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Knights;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Bishops;
 King + 2 Bishops against King + Knight

 In 1992 during the FIDE Congress in Manila the Rules Committee
 suggested establishing one rule for all endings: 50 moves, and
 the General Assembly of FIDE approved the change.  In 1996 the
 Congress in Yerevan revisited the decision and kept the 1992
 rules.  There are currently no exceptions to the 50-move rule.

Ah, I haven't been keeping up. But then, human chess players are not
computers, so perhaps the need for the extensions wasn't real. My
inclination would have been to make it a 75-move rule if simplicity
and uniformity were desired.

Just what I wrote above before reading this part of your reply!
Great minds think alike? &lt;grin&gt;

How about this?  At the 50th move, allow either player to claim that
he can win if given another X number of moves.  If X is 50 moves or 
more longer than the fastest win in the tablebases, he loses at once.
If he reaches move X without winning, he loses.  Could this work?
It might be especially advantageous in correspondence chess where
tablebases are reference material that are available for consultation 
by either player.

I had thought that the computer studies had led to a need for 
up to about 250 moves in some positions, not merely 75, however.

Look at entry 316 at 
[ <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_16.htm">http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_16.htm</a> ]
They found a a position where it takes White 517 moves to win 
(get into a winning position) with white always aiming for the
fastest win and black always stalling as much as he can. 

In semifinals of the 2007 World Cup, Sergey Karjakin and Alexey 
Shirov were tied and played two rapid games as a tiebreaker.
One of these games ended up in an endgame where, with best play,
Shirov had a position that was a win in 208 moves.  Needless to 
say, it was a computer doing post-analysis that figured this out.
