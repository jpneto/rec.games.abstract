World Championship Computer-Roshambo 2004
=========================================

As part of the 9th Computer Olympiad, taking place in Ramat-Gan, Israel
on July 4 - 12, 2004, a world championship in Computer-RoShamBo
will be organized. The competition will run on a computer located
at IKAT in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Participation is free of charge.

We especially encourage students to participate in the competition.

What is RoShamBo?
-----------------

RoShamBo is a game played all over the world. In Japan, where it
is very popular, it is called Jan Ken and in the USA and England it is
called Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is quite simple. Two players
sit facing each other and on a sign they first stamp three times with
the right fist in the open left hand and then they simultaneously make
a gesture with their right hand.

There are three different gestures:
 "Rock" - closed fist;
 "Paper" - stretched hand;
 "Scissors" - two fingers spread.

Now it is time to determine who wins. The following rule applies: The
scissors are stronger than paper because they can cut paper. The rock
beats the scissors because it blunts the scissors. Paper beats the rock
because paper can cover the rock. If both players make the same gesture,
nobody wins


Of course, the game is performed a number of times, because the thrill
of the game is to predict what the opponent will do the next time.

In Japan the game is often played at the dinner table or, as a gimmick,
to determine who has to do a certain job. The Japanese then
say "Jan Ken Pon!" to start the game.


Computer-RoShamBo!
------------------

The purpose of the competition is to write a Java program that can play
RoShamBo. Your program will play against all other participating
programs and the program winning the most games is the champion.

We have chosen the programming language Java because many students learn
Java in school and it is independent from the operating system (Windows,
Linux, Apple, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to put your contribution
as a Java-applet on a website for everybody who wants to play against it.

When you write a RoShamBo program you must keep the following in mind.
 From a mathematical point of view, the best approach is to play
randomly (with equal probability on the three gestures). In the long
term, nobody can beat you then. However, this does not help you in a
competition like this, because we do not play long enough. Therefore, you
should try to predict the moves of your opponent and react on that, or
you should try to be smarter than your opponent.

In contrast to some previous editions of the competition (in which a list
of so-called dummy bots was provided), this time you will not get any clues
on
which opponents you will encounter.

How do you participate?
-----------------------

Surf to <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/~donkers/games/roshambo04">http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/~donkers/games/roshambo04</a> and read
the instructions. On this site you will also find links to background
information on computer-RoShamBo.

Inform us as soon as possible but before June 1, 2004, by an email
to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:roshambo@icga.org">roshambo@icga.org</a> that you are going to participate in the competition
(subject: participation roshambo).

Your submission should be received before July 1, 2004, the competition
will be held on July 2 and the results are announced at the Computer
Olympiad.

Who is organizing this?
----------------------

This World Championship Computer Roshambo 2004 is organized by the
Institute for Knowledge and Agent Techology IKAT of the Universiteit
Maastricht and the International Computer Games Association, ICGA.
