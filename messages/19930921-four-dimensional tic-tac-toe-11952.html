I assume you really do mean 4-dimensional, i.e. 4x4x4x4.  I spent a bit
of time and found a draw, as follows:

Let L (left) and R (right) represent the following 4x4 planes:

	    X O X O			    O X O X
	L:  X O X O			R:  O X O X
	    O X O X			    X O X O
	    O X O X			    X O X O

Obviously there are no 4-in-a-rows on either L or R alone.  Now consider
a cube constructed from 3 Ls and 1 R (or 3 Rs and 1 L, by symmetry).
There are two distinct cases: LLLR and LLRL.

		X O X O     X O X O     X O X O     O X O X
	LLLR:	X O X O     X O X O     X O X O     O X O X
		O X O X     O X O X     O X O X     X O X O
		O X O X     O X O X     O X O X     X O X O


		X O X O     X O X O     O X O X     X O X O
	LLRL:	X O X O     X O X O     O X O X     X O X O
		O X O X     O X O X     X O X O     O X O X
		O X O X     O X O X     X O X O     O X O X

A bit of examination shows that neither of these cubes has a 4-in-a-row.
So now, construct a 4x4x4x4 hypercube as follows:

	L L L R
	L L L R
	L R L L
	R L R R

QED.

I'm curious as to whether there's a technique that generalises to finding
draws in any number of dimensions, or inversely, whether there's a way to
prove that some suitably high dimension 4^n board cannot draw.

Anybody have any insights on these higher-dimensional questions?
