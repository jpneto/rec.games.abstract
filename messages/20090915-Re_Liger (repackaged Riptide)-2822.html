Nick, you were right.  The rich-get-richer phenomenon started to
manifest itself after several days of play testing.  I switched back
to the Min-showing version and the transformation from unstable to
stable was remarkable.  Good call.  If only there were more like you
here and less of the lemma quoting bore mongers.  I have to ask
though, are we ever going to see an equal goals game from you?

I guess the novelty of the mechanic makes it hard

It really is hard to analyze.  The backward move thing doesn't come
into play so much in the early and middle portions.  You just want to
move forward, not backward.  In the end game though, you definitely
want to move backward, grab an enemy checker, and drag it back across
the board.  You only have to push it for two moves to break even,
three moves to get ahead relative to your opponent.

Equal goals games
can be just as prone to inequality of winning chances as unequal goals
games (e.g. Hex without the pie rule), so equal goals has no special
import to me.

That's totally incorrect.  These two inequities compound each other.
There could be no game more skewed than an unequal goals connection
game without the pie rule, and that's exactly what bothers me about
unequal goals games.  They torture me.  I'm just clowning around, but
at the same time, when I read your announcement of a new game a few
posts back, about halfway through I realized that it was only a minor
variation of previous games, and it was deflating.
