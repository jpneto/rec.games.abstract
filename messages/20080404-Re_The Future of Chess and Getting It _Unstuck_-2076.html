<br>You don't need to be an athlete to watch a game of football, but you
<br>do need to be intelligent to understand a game of Chess. That is where
<br>the limit to the popularity of Chess comes from, and a change to the
<br>rules to fix that would only destroy Chess! (Smess, anyone?)
<br></blockquote>
<br>This argument gets repeated enough that it's worth refuting.
<br>First, following high level chess is not even popular among
<br>those who play chess. Second, games that are even harder
<br>to understand than chess, e.g. Go, manage to get more of
<br>a following than chess does.
<br>
<br>I have never seen anyone provide a single bit of data in
<br>support of the theory that chess' popularity is near some
<br>inherent limit. Holding that belief, given that high level
<br>chess has a number of obvious defects, is nothing more
<br>than a mindless defense of the status quo.
