I think it was in "Winning ways for your mathematical plays"
by Berlekamp, Conway &amp; Guy that I found a game called the
"Black Path Game", which had the disadvantage of being an
easy win for one side. Two players build a path that starts
in one corner of a squared board by alternately extending it
with one of the pieces

  _________  _________  _________
  |   |   |  |   |   |  |   |   |
  |  /    |  |   |   |  |    \  |
  |--   --|  |---+---|  |--   --|
  |    /  |  |   |   |  |  \    |
  |___|___|  |___|___|  |___|___|


The first player who steers the path off the board loses.
Now, when a player can tile the empty squares by non-
overlapping dominoes, he wins by always steering the path
into the interior line of one of them.

Some ten years ago I thought about a modification of the
rules that was supposed to make the game more interesting:

   When a player steers the path into
   another piece, he gets an extra move.

I remember playing it with some friends and it seemed quite
playable on a 6x6 or possibly an 8x8 board. I called this
variation "Blackout", and I would like to hear comments
from others who try it out.
