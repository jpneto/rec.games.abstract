Random search techniques are not suitable for most games because of the
enormous computer power required to generate enough random, complete plays
that meaningful patterns start to emerge in the data.  Having an infinite
tree certainly doesn't help to this end.  Even my finite games are mostly
unsuitable for random search, like Oust for example.  Oust would be
resistant to all forms of AI, especially random search.

Random search isn't inherently afraid of haystack needles.  All of the bad
strategies random play engenders cancel each other out, leaving intelligent
play outstanding.  Again, it's just the raw computer power needed to
generate all that data.  One essential requirement for random search is a
virtual nothing of a heuristic.  In Flume, for example, you need to know
whether an even or an odd number of turns were required to fill in a given
area, on average.  More specifically, there will be a distribution.  If it's
a spike on one number, then it's settled.  There are n turns available in
that region.  If the spikes are divided between two numbers, then there's a
"switch" in the region - a formation which can require an even or an odd
number of turns to fill out, depending on how the fill-in is initiated.  The
data might also indicate two switches in the region, etc.
