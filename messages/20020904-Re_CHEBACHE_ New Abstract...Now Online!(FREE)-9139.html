He has. I doubt many backgammon players have looked at it, which might be a shame, or not. The statement that it
combines chess and checkers with backgammon is unlikely to produce much interest from backgammon players.

I think chess could use some mild randomization so that one can have "rollouts" as in backgammon (or Scrabble, though
the latter are suspect because of hidden information) and objectively valid statements about the relative strengths of
moves, the way one can have in games of skill and chance. I think this would make chess more mathematical. However, Ed
Formanek (an IM and mathematician) didn't seem to like the idea.
