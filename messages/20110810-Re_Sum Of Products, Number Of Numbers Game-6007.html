Player 1 gets the sum of the scores for each row. The score for a row

Player 2 gets the sum of the scores for each column. The score for a

A player gets no points for a row/column if there are no 1's in that
row/column.

The last stipulation seems gratuitously irregular.  It would be more
consistent for rows without any 1s to score as the empty product, 1.

Yes, I agree with you. I was ambivalent on there being a score of 1 or
0 in such a case.  But since someone else (you) came out and said it
would be better with a score of 1, I agree now.

Thanks,
