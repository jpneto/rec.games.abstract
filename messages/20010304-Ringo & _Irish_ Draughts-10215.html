I've been looking for the origins of a couple games for a while. 

Ringo is a variation on Fox &amp; Geese-type games where one player has an
advantage in movement to make up for his smaller army. The attacker wins by
getting two piece into the center space, the smaller defender wins by
capturing all but one attacker. It's played on a circular board with a
"neutral zone" where pieces are safe from being jumped/captured. A couple
sources I have say Ringo is German, but I haven't found a date or inventor for it.

Irish Draughts is a Checkers/draughts variant that uses a die. Players must
move a single checker the number of spaces indicated by a roll of a die, and
lose a turn if they do not have enough room to move that far. I'm trying to
find the age of the game, and whether it is truely "Irish"?
