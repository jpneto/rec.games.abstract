Interesting idea.  Have you checked if this board retains the
unique-winner criterion?

Thanks Torben!  Good to hear from you again.  Fractal is thoroughly
untested.  When I first created the Fractal board, I checked it over
to make sure there weren't any 4-way intersections.  That was the
extent of my unique-winner analysis.  I created a rule sheet last
night, and this was the first time I connected sides.  Luckily, no
problems there.  :)   I reluctantly opened your message today, half
expecting a flaw to be revealed in the game.

I think the most valuable hexes will be the outer hexes that touch two edge colors.

Quite possibly.  Some of the cells will be more valuable than others,
just as in Hex.  Worst case, I've accomplished the opposite of my
objective, creating a game even more lopsided than Hex. I did briefly
consider the corner cells in Fractal, and here's what I concluded: If
we both grab up the corner cells (that touch two color regions) then
play will have to work its way toward the middle of the board,
becoming "confused" along the way, and resolve itself there.

I don't have Christian Freeling's gift for envisioning gameplay given
only the set of rules to consider.  Far from it.  My printer doesn't
work and I don't have anyone to play against even if it did.  Solo
testing a game in Adobe Illustrator is too boring to even attempt.  I
was hoping someone would program Fractal for Internet play but
apparently, and not surprisingly, a Fractal program would be a tough
nut to crack.
