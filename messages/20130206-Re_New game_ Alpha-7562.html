In Alpha you can reduce the score of the opponent by connecting his groups. Is there any such mechanism in Produto?

Yep, in fact this is central to gameplay. Say your two largest groups are 10 stones apiece, and your third largest group is 4. Your current score is 100. Your opponent connects your two largest groups by adding a stone. Now your score is 84.

Regarding similarities, it's almost as if there were fashion in game design.. There's been a lot of 'connection' recently, both 'dynamic' and 'static'. In the latter the 'square connection' has been extensively explored. 
Similarities between games on that particular theme would seem to be inherent, but the mere fact that they have the same object and are played on a square board using 'pieces', doesn't in my opinion make them 'variants' of one another, or Slither would be a Twixt variant. Moreover, I don't even see any particular objection against variants. Hexdame and GrandChess are literal variants of existing games.

Regarding 'dynamic' connection' ('dynamic goal' connection actually, but that's such a mouthful) it occured to me that a kind of wave started, following your game "Byg" and my game "Symple", both in October 2010.

In it's wake came Ketchup and Produto (and Sygo and Scware, but these don't have dynamic connection in their object, only in their mechanisms) and Ayu..
I feel Ayu hit the bull's eye as a quintessential implementation of the theme, far more so than the previous representative LOA.

Now there's Alpha, and it's not Ayu. They can't all be Ayu, now can they? Alpha has undeniable similarities with Produto. Same 1-2-2... move protocol with the option to place either color and a very similar object. Same pie-rule, same tie-rule. The difference is in the object.

On the one side I like the object of Alpha better. Your argument regarding 10x10 or 21x4 shows that this kind of tension is present in Produto, 'central' even, but it is very much 'by example'. If the third group is '5', you've countered the threat already, and there are only 3 groups involved. I feel the reduction resulting from connecting opponent's groups is a clear and present general threat in Alpha, while in Produto it is more specific and at times it might be fading.

So on the one side I feel Alpha might be better, on the other hand I think it is very similar to Produto indeed. But if you don't mind, and Luis doesn't, then I certainly wouldn't.
