Quite a neat little game, especially considering the design

Thanks Bill.

As a strategic game, though, I suspect not one of the greats.
Nowhere near the excellent complexity-generating simplicity

That's exactly what I suspected too.  I naturally assumed that Basic's
gameplay would be a zugzwangathon, and the first couple of test runs
seemed to bear that out.  I've been playing and messing around with
staged scenarios every day for the past several days, contrary to my
usual m.o. of indifference, and gameplay is not a zugzwangathon.  To
me, with my juvenile sense of what makes for good gameplay, Basic
seems like a rich and complex game.  Little tactics are beginning to
form, like Don't let one of your 2-stacks get pinned down if you can
help it.  I'm seeing strategy/counterstrategy elements take shape.
Rushing into enemy territory can work, but it can also backfire
because there's a basic counter strategy for that, etc.

The strategic ideas seem to be (AFAICS) quite simple -
try to make piles with oppo-stones on the bottom, as
far up the board as possible; otherwise common sense
applies, to a largely parity-based substrate.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, I had the same notion.  Why parity turns out not to be problem
is hard to explain.  I'm not saying parity doesn't exist.  In fact at
some point in the game it's all parity - essentially game over if
played out using a reasonable algorithm.  But parity is surprisingly
not the problem one would expect in a game such as this.

BTW, it could be made even simpler, or at least "clean-lined",
by using 16 checkers each, with the board starting full.
Though this would not allow a checkers set to be used, OC.
Some backgammon or Othello checkers wiould have to be added in...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yep, the 24 checker limit is a curse, but it also presents a worthy
challenge in constructing a big enough game tree.  And of course it
makes for a very accessible game in real life.  Right now I'm of the
belief that Basic's game tree is huge, in a general sense, not just
for a Checkers game.  Not Go huge, but...  And this could still change
for the worse, as strategy slowly develops and pitfalls may be
uncovered.  I don't know if Basic's gameplay will turn out to be
"great" in any sense, but I'm not strictly ruling that in or out at
this point.
