|&gt; I have a big interest in games of all kind. My favorite game is Cribbage.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Now here's my question: On my local BBS I found 4 newsgroups dealing with  
|&gt; games:
|&gt; /rec/games/abstract

Generic Abstract Games.  Cribbage is probably best discussed here.

No - perfect knowledge, pure strategy games. Cribbage is definitely off-
charter in rec.games.abstract.

I don't think there is an existing group whose charter includes Cribbage,
however, apart from rec.games.misc (and there, it is likely to be swamped
by the computer games traffic). But the creation of a group called
rec.games.playing-cards is currently being discussed on news.groups, and
I would think that Cribbage would be entirely welcome there if and when
it is created.

In case you don't know, creating a Usenet group involves a discussion period
on news.groups followed by a vote about the group's creation. So if you're
interested in the group being created, I would suggest subscribing to
news.groups and expressing an interest in the group either by posting or by
emailing the group proponent. Or you could simply subscribe to the much lower
volume news.announce.newgroups and watch out for the CFV (Call For Votes) for
the group to come up. If too many people do this, however, there is a risk
that the group proponent will decide there isn't enough interest and not
take the proposal to a vote.

One other thing that has been stated during the discussion of the new group
is that small amounts of discussion of other card games is tolerated on
rec.games.bridge. I have no first hand experience of whether this is true,
though.
