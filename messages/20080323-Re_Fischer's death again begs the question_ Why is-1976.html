By the way, just to inject some actual data on the magnitude of the
draw problem in chess...

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessgames.com">http://www.chessgames.com</a> has a large database of games, mostly
between strong players.  Their `opening explorer'[1] gives win/loss/
draw statistics for the most commonly played openings.  Of these, the
moves 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 account for 98.3% of the 460,000
games in the database.  Restricting to those four opening moves, we
see that:

  36.8% of games (167,000) are won by White
  36.6% of games (166,000) are drawn
  26.6% of games (120,000) are won by Black

We already have 63.4% of games ending in a win by one player or the
other.  Is it really necessary to `solve' this `draw problem'?

Another issue is this: it is clearly seen that White has an advantage.
White scores, on average, 0.551 points per game, compared to Black's
0.449 points per game.  Any system that reduces the score for draws
will make Black's position slightly worse, since he gets more of his
points from draws.  The option of giving a third of a point for draws
would give White 0.490 points per game and give Black 0.388: White
goes from scoring 55.1% of the available points to scoring 55.8% of
the points.  This effect is smaller than I would have expected.

a) The other idea being kicked around [and collated at Chessbase] is to 
maintain current scoring systems in terms of overall points, but to adjust 
the score for white draws to 0.4 and black draws to 0.6.

b) Its also interesting to me that statistics are from strong players only, 
and a comparison is to look at the just concluded Russian youth event, see 
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.ruschess.com">www.ruschess.com</a> which is also repeated in this week's Parrot at 
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.chessville.com">www.chessville.com</a> where the full round-by-round scores are viewable, and 
also by gender.

This is a relatively small sample compared with David Richerby's statistics, 
but nevertheless offer a different view of W : D : L ratios, for <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>most<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> 
players.

c) To consult a larger basse of all players: can anyone offer current USCF W 
: D : L ratios for (i) adults and (ii) for youth/scholastic play?

d) I wonder if W : D : L is significantly different in the top 1% of players 
than to all other players of the game? And if so, then at <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> level some 
experiments might be made.

e) Given the introduction of computers and also the net as means of 
researching opponents games, I also wonder if the top 1% of players now have 
a different W : D : L ratio than, say, the generation playing during 
1950-1980?

f) To confound the issue further there was a change in the post-Fischer 
years to more invitational tournaments, where the same players encountered 
each other over and over again - and I also wonder if this isn't a major 
contributing factor to the W : D : L ratio?
