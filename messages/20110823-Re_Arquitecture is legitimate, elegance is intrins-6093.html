Ideally all rules should be intrinsic and implicitly legitimate.
That's what makes a game quintessential.

Implicitly: this isn't the whole story. I've never been able to
visualize a game as "the quintessential chess game". I've stripped the
idea of 'checkmate' from aspects that could be considered non-
essential, as in Chad, but not without having to introduce new
aspects. I've minimized it intentionally in Caissa and Cyclix.
Ironically, but in sync with the above, the most minimal
implementation, Shakti, came unintentional while fooling around with
Isola.

There's an irony of sorts here. If there would have been a contest to
make a game that's identical to its misere complement, Luigi might not
have come up with Yodd, but looking fot the quintessential non-parity
game brought it on. Sometimes one just has to pay attention instead of
ploughing towards a specific goal.

For lack of anything else, 'architecture', if anywhere, applies to
Chess variants. And with it come different criteria for good or bad
architecture.
