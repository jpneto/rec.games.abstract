Hi folks,

this is just a thought that crossed my mind this morning - the shower is a
really creative place.

I was thinking about card games and realized, that all (at least the ones I
know) card decks are two dimensional (value x suit or colour).
Has anyone ever thought of a three (or even four, five - well, I could go
on like this for quite a while...) dimensional card deck? The obvious (?)
design I came up with was: 
	VALUE x COLOUR x SIZE
If you give each dimension four possible values, you get 64 different cards, 
which looks like a nice deck-size to me.

Now, that we have the design - or at least a first attempt - we have to
find an application for it. Everything I could come up with up to now, is
very mechanical (i.e. boring :( ) so all comments on this thought would be
greatly appreciated.

	Ciao,
	   Uwe

You have just come up with a marvellous description of the cards used
by the game "Set".

Set uses a 3x3x3x3 deck (3 colors, 3 shapes, 3 fills, and 1-3 pictures
on the card).  The object of the game is remove sets of 3 cards which
are either all the same or all different in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>each<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the four
categories. The concept is very simple, but the play is actually very
challenging.  I believe the game has even gotten some sort of
accolades from Mensa.

This is a remarkably good game, and I highly recommend it.  One word
of warning, however-- don't play with a kid!  My 7 year old routinely
kills me in this game ;-)
