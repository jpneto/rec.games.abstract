....which was preceded by years of snot issuing from the nose of Bill Taylor,
insisting that everyone in rec.games.abstract "earn" his respect.  Years of
having my world class designs totally ignored in favor of the latest Nim
variant because the Nim variant designer had "earned" Bill's respect -
unlike me, who was deemed unworthy.  Sure I got ugly.  The only recourse I
had was to deem the deemers unworthy.  And guess what?  They all had the
good sense to get the fuck out, except Bill Taylor who can't tear himself
away from rec.games.abstract - in spite of his tear streaked departure a
couple weeks ago.

In a nutshell, Bill Taylor created a forum in which top designers rule the
roost - and then failed to be a top designer.  Along comes me, world class
designer.  "Oh shit, now what do we do??  Ok, emergency mandate!  We only
recognize top designers whom Bill Taylor has deemed worthy!"

And that was really the root of all the ugliness.  The more world class
games I released, the less worthy I became here.  Now the whole ugly crew
has shuffled off into obscurity where they belong.  Primarily it's just Bill
Taylor now carrying on with this lost, wandering soul shit.  He's got no
place to go because nobody wants him!

This is actually very interesting.  Havannah is such a household name that
Bill Taylor knew he could safely use it as an example, and everyone would
know what he was talking about (or at least what game he was referencing). 
The notability of designer Christian Freeling would seem indisputable.  Yet,
when Christian first showed up at rec.games.abstract, where was the "Hi
Christian" from Bill Taylor?  The "How are you"?  The "Welcome to the
group"?

Christian was immediately deemed unworthy by Bill Taylor, exactly as I was,
and for the exact same reason:  We are what Bill Taylor is not - world class
abstract game designers.  Only this time, Bill Taylor's snottiness was even
more absurd, because he essentially came out of rec.games.abstract
retirement just to deem Christian Freeling unworthy.  And me still being
unworthy too, of course.

Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Bill, you didn't "fail to respond sufficiently

were talking about!!  Me, Corey, Nick, Christian....  everyone who was
involved in the discussion was asking you the same thing.  "What the fuck
are you talking about, Bill????"  All we got in response was spam.  Honking,
snorting, bellowing...   Ascii troll pictures...  Not one syllable of
explanation.  In fact now is very the first time, after weeks of your
bullshit, that you've said anything in response, you oaf!!!!!

What the fuck are you talking about, Bill????  That's exactly what I did

Bill, you can't ****possibly**** be claiming credit for generalized Atoll. 
Rewrite the history of the group.  Rewrite your role as victim.  But don't
rewrite Atoll you thieving piece of shit.  You're so fucking desperate,
you're pathetic.  Get some integrity, Bill.  It's not too late....

On the same note: I wish Bill would keep to

I never left here.  Mark Steere said he was going to leave

Last time you accused me of leaving the group I asked you for the reference,
which you still have not provided.  Start combing Bill.  Maybe you can also
turn up the post where ****you**** discovered generalized Atoll while you're
at it, lol.

Bill, I'm sorry your plan to become a world class designer didn't pan out,
and that desperation has driven you to my coattails.  But you cannot camp
out on my coattails.  There just isn't room for your fat ass.

Incidentally, this post will almost certainly draw more
