<br>&nbsp;What's that?&nbsp; Sounds like something in which I might be interested.

<br>
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@gamerz.net">pbmserv@gamerz.net</a> is an automated play-by-email server that (at last count)
<br>understand over 130 various (most abstract) games.&nbsp; We have 2000+ users 
scattered around the world, and the server processed ~3000 moves a day.
<br>
<br>It does NOT play the games.&nbsp; Rather, it acts as referee.&nbsp; Players send their 
moves to the server (as the Subject: line), and it verifies that the move is 
valid for the game/board, and it updates the state of the board and sends the 
new board to all interested parties.&nbsp; (people can subscribe to games in 
progress, etc.)&nbsp; Additionally, any text included in the BODY of the message is 
included with the board as comments.&nbsp; So you can have nice, long running 
conversations with your opponents.
