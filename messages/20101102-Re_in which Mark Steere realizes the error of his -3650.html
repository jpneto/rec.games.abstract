What the fuck are you talking about??  The last time I logged on here, there
were four nearly identical posts from you, all uploaded within the space of
an hour.  Why don't you finalize your posts before you upload them, you
idiot??  No wonder Howe was complaining about you.  You're fucking retarded.

"Take it down"??  This is an unmoderated newsgroup.  You can't "take it
down".  Are you on magic mushrooms????

Clark, you'll never be me, so stop trying.  There isn't any "torch".  The
only lighting ceremony is going to me lighting a big spleef in my backyard -
for me to smoke, by myself.

"greatest minds", rofl
rofl whoever they are rofl they left of their own accord rofl long before I
ever set foot here rofl

People who <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>would<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be valuable contributors have told me they wouldn't post
here because of the idiots (case in point - Clark), not because I'm here
chasing away "great minds", rofl. Stupidest thing I've ever heard.

Freeling is the nearest thing to a "great mind" this shitty group has had
since I started reading it.  You clowns should be rolling out the red
carpet.  But no, you're complaining about how I chased out imaginary "great
minds".  Show me one "great mind" I chased out of rec.games.abstract.  I'll
send him a hand written apology note and a boquet of pink roses.
