Crossway in particular doesn't require play testing beyond determining
the best board sizes for various skill levels.  Why?  In a word,
architecture.  Crossway is one of my most organic designs.

There are only two possibilities for Crossway gameplay. Totally broken
or totally awesome.  And there's only one problem Crossway could have.
Turn order advantage.  Since there are equitable starting moves
available, and since the pie rule is used, and since it's highly
scalable, Crossway's magnificence can be deduced.

If you look at the stats on Game Site X, Hex has  53% TOA and Crossway
has a 52.5% TOA.  Both of these stats are misleading since both games
are ideal.  The skewed stats reflect a non-understanding of the pie
rule by beginners (e.g. you).

You've discovered a game that's too hard for you.
