Two - most game championships can be edited into small packages. 
The TV coverage of the Scrabble U.S. Open lasts one hour, as does
the National Geographic Bee; the Scripps National Spelling Bee's
finals run a little longer than two hours on TV, even though it
is a two-day event.  You can't cover the world chess championship
like this.

Also note the Fischer-Spassky match had a fixed 24-game limit.  I
think the next few were "first to X wins", which means that they
would have no idea how many weeks it would last.  It's hard to
find TV time under these conditions.

Why couldn't you do a time compress edit on chess matches and also
not have chess matches split a draw 1/2-1/2 and then have highest
score after a fix number of games?

Even run Speed Chess as a possibility as a way to get chess on TV.
Why not something?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Chess is inherently a slow game. The pace is much too slow to be
interesting to the typical TV audience.

If you speed it up, either by taping it and editing out the think
time, or by making it speed chess to begin with, the audience will
never follow what's going on. They'd have a hard enough time even if
it were slow and with someone explaining.

I do agree that speed chess is likely too fast for people.  However,
why can't moves be paced through editing to come in roughly 45-60
seconds?  Why is not 45-60 seconds sufficient time to explain what is
going on?  American football is more complicated than chess, and yet
ends up on TV.

I think this relates to what needs to happen before chess will get on TV: 
more people have to be able to follow what's happening. Take a look at, 
say, football and basketball. 

When the Madden series of videogames came out, it was the first really 
popular game that got all the rules of football right, so an entire 
generation raised on videogames can watch a football broadcast and 
understand everything that's happening. Football viewership has been 
steadily increasing, especially among that young age bracket. 

Basketball, on the other hand, never suffered from too much complexity. 
Videogames didn't introduce any new viewers to any subtle nuances. Even 
worse, as the graphics improved, more kids would rather play basketball 
on the XBox than watch it on TV. Viewership goes down.

If someone can release a game that is to chess what Madden was to 
football, and somehow get a significant chunk of the young population 
that can recognize and appreciate advanced play, THEN you can get it on 
TV.

Or, just do what poker did, and have an amateur win millions of dollars 
in the big tournament, and appeal to the 'that could be me!' factor.
