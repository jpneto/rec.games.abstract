Chinese Chess Pro is a Chinese Chess program running on Macintosh.
It requires System 7 to run.
The program is distributed as a shareware. I will find a ftp site to put
it later. But if you want to receive it through mail, please send me a
message.
The package size is about 100k.

There are many features in the program. The following are some of them. 

1. You can play against the computer, or let computer play both sides.
2. You can play the program with other players over an AppleTalk network.
3. You can play the game over a phone line with other players by running   
        
   AppleTalk  Remote Access.
4. You can chat with your opponent, even send your voice over the network
   while you are playing.
5. You can retract the moves whenever you want
6. You can save the game and play it later.
7. You can print the board out or save the board image to a PICT file.
8. You can generate your open book youself.
9. You can time the game.

The strength of the program is pretty decent.
