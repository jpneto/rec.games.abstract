I will state I did engage in a bit of hyperbole, but I have found that
when a game ends up getting very serious dedication to it, it does
take on religious overtones.  Any suggestions to any change are seen
as heresy of a sort.  So, while I end up overstating from a point of
absurdity, out of the intent for people to disagree and say, "Now now,
we aren't THAT intolerant, are we?" it is done in order to then
discuss the possible future and changes [...] so I end up with a slight 
nose tweak

Is it OK if I accuse you of all sorts of things that are not true
and dismiss it as a "slight nose tweak"?  Or is being an asshole 
reserved for you alone?

You called me a heretic to my face. "And my comments about considering 
a change in the chess rules is considered heresy by you."  You might 
want to make a note when you insult someone so you will know why they 
are so pissed off at you.
