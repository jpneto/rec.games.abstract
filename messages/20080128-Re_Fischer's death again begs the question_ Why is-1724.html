The answer is - as always - pretty simple: it doesn't attract enough
viewers!

Even simpler: There aren't enough sponsors willing to pay for it to be
on air.

Magic: The Gathering, the World Series of Poker, Scrabble, the
Spelling Bee, paintball, etc. aren't on TV because they necessarily
expected to draw in viewership, but because there are companies
willing to pay for the airtime on whatever networks to put them on the
air.  Those companies are making a bet that whatever outlay they put
out on production and airtime is going to be made up by increased
sales in the long run.  

Who is going to sponsor chess?  You can't copyright the game and limit
competition for direct sales (unlike Scrabble/Magic) and expect to get
a return on your investment by direct sales.  You don't have an
established venue and revenue stream (unlike poker in casinos and web
sites).  The spelling bee model would be the one you'd have to adopt:
find a company with deep enough pockets that is willing to sponsor it.
The Scripps Spelling Bee itself is run as a not-for-profit venture 
and they have buy-in from schools (and home-schools) all over the US.

It would be a heck of a lot harder to get the same kind of thing for
chess.
