This is a follow up to my idea of expanding beyond the ferk whatever
device as different ways to do double blind games without a ref.  Here
is my idea for a re

Not exactly sure the materials used, but the basic idea is as follows:

Take a board and put a chessboard pattern on each side, with the
spaces matching exactly.  The board goes face up between the two
players

On one side of the board, a player would put all his pieces on the top
of the board.  On the other side, the person would put their pieces on
the bottom.  The pieces would have magnets on them, both with the same
polarity (either positive or negative).  Either the magnets would hold
themselves onto the board, or there would be a nick in the board to
hold the piece.

Players would alternate turns moving their pieces as usual.  A piece
would move one space at a time (in the direction they choose) until
either a players stops or their opponent informs them that they
knocked one of their pieces off the board (the magnet would repel the
other piece on the board.  Before a move, it is recommended players
announce that they are making a move a piece move or a capture move. 
Players need to determine what happens once contact is made, whether
the captured piece is announced, or if during a move, a player bumps
into an opponent's piece

A diagram of the configuration would look like the following: 
On one side of the board: 
RNBQKBNR 
PPPPPPPP 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 

On the other side would be: 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 
........ 
PPPPPPPP 
RNBQKBNR 

And as stated above these two board would be back to back of each
other.  Queens should be opposite queens, etc...  Please reverse the
order of the pieces if this isn't so.

Anyhow, that is the idea.  Feel free to expand on the idea.
