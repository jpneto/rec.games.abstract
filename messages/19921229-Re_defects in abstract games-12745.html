Melfin Nicholson proposes some criteria:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
1: state should be limited to position of pieces on the board and whose
turn it is, with no reference to 'previous board positions' and other
phenominon which must be tracked
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So you would consider a "no repeated positions" rule a defect?  I'm
not sure whether I do or not-- but then again, these are very aesthetic
questions; no surprise that we don't all agree.  Hmm-- what happens
if you eliminate such a rule, anyway?  You end up im places where
the players might loop forever... if you just say that's a loss for
both of them, does that take care of it?  No, I suppose not, because
there's no good way to decide which one should break the loop.
Pity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

when the "no repeat" rule is regarded as a "defect" patch, then, to
get rid of it, possible games are limited to those that do not need
such a rule.  he has suggested othello/reversi.  there are many games
where a repeated position cannot occur.  the question is whether the
numerous other games which do have that possibilty otherwise should be
disallowed.  of course not.  but, then, the "no repeat" rule might be
a concession to 1 defect.  1 aint bad.  especially when you consider
what else is at stake.  i am sort of on a fence.  the elegance (and
elegance is certainly a goal of good abstract game design) of the
Chinese Go rules versus the Japanese is persuasive.  indeed, it may
be that you have to add a defect in the name of elegance.

2: the rules should not admit special cases and be symmetric to all
peices and positions
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sometimes it's hard to say what's a special case.  The starting
position in [othello/reversi] always seemed somewhat arbitrary to
me; one of the beauties of go was the fact that the board starts
empty, and only the strategy inherent in the rules determines
the first move.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

i agree that this is a beauty of Go.  however, i dont think the arbitrary
quality of a game has to be a bad thing, and i wouldnt categorize it
under "defect removing".  its more under the "easy to describe" column.
consider the arrangement at the beginning of a chess game....
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think flawlessness needs some kind of not-too-easy characteristic...
I think that perfect play being known is definitely a flaw, for example.
Yes, I realize how arbitrary "known" is... maybe "practical to play"?
One of the appeals of "mental jujitsu" is that it's state-tree isn't
computable, because players don't alternate-- but I think that's
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>too<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much to ask from a poor innocent little game...

flawlessness?  in my other response to Melfin's post, i came up with
desirability.  there is perhaps too much of a constraint in using
terms like "zero-defects" and "flawless"....:-)
