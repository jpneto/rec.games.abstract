I recommend Go to anyone interested in old games.  Go is perhaps the oldest

This is a fantastic understatement.  Chess is a featherweight compared
to Go.  The best comparison I have seen is that Go is as popular in
China and Japan as <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>professional golf<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is in the USA.

But to take the conversation back a few steps... Pente is not GO-Moku,
it's Pente, which was invented in the USA and is somewhat different
from the GO-Moku game it owes it's inspiration to.

Jumping back yet another step, the really cool pente sets in the tube
are still available in Games of Berkeley (though I'm afraid that is a
bit far from Oklahoma, and don't know how long it'll last)

As for Go in China/Japan being as popular as Pro Golf is in the USA,
that is a drastic overstatement.  There were people speading the same
sort of ridiculous exagerations of the popularity of chess is the USSR
(well, back when there was a USSR).  I don't want to knock the popularity
of Go, as I freely admit that it's a very popular board game, but golf
in the USA has a lot stronger backing than Go (or Chess) do anywhere.

Aside from the established PGA, LPGA, and Seniors tours, which are
covered weekly by television and viewed by hundreds of thousands on
any given weekend during the season and by tens of millions during some 
of the celebrity events like the Pebble Beach Classic, there are also
numerous local charity and professional golf events which include a lot
of people throughout the country.

Sorry to be such a wet blanket, but I have seen enough spontaneous
statistics on the net recently to exceed my patience, and this post was
more of a last straw than anything else.  Suffice it to say that when
someone makes a request for a particular item like a Pente board, that
it not grounds to start this "My game is more {complex, popular,
older, played by {intelligent, cultured, sophisticated} players }"
thread over again.
