I went to a games festival in Paris last June and talked to a
representative of the French checkers association about this
checkers program. He had never heard of it. When he found out it
wasn't the French version of the game he lost all interest since he
thought the games were totally different and he didn't know anything
about this other game.

Continental version is played on a 10 x 10 board (I recently
discovered, when my (Dutch) gf showed me a double sided board for
chess on one side and draughts/checkers on the reverse!).  The rules
are also a little differet IIRC, and I think you can take backwards
with a standard piece if it's part of a chain of captures.

Yes, this is the first main difference, the second one being that promoted
pieces (queens?) being able to long range move and capture. In combination,
this makes a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> different game, far less solvable than checkers in
all expert opinions. Best programs are in the national master range, still a
long way towaer world champion (not to mention exact solving)


  I'd need

to check to be sure of the exact differences, but there certainly are
some.
