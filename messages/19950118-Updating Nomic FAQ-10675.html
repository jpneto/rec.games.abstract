0. Where can I get this FAQ?

This FAQ is can be FTP'ed from ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au in the directory
/pub/doc/nomic/FAQ.

An HTTP version also exists at:
 <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2119737/nomic-faq.html">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2119737/nomic-faq.html</a>

The http version of this file is probably more up-to-date, but I will
strive to keep the two in roughly the same state.

Any sites interested in mirroring this file are welcome to do so.
Please contact me so that I can include you in this section.

1. What is Nomic?

	Asking the question "What is Nomic?" is like asking the question
"What is a hacker?" or "What is Zen?" - people tend to get all mystical
and cryptic, and you end up with no real idea at all. :)

	Nomic is a game, and it is a lot of FUN! Unlike most games, the
rules of nomic are not written in stone. In fact, the object of the game
is to make changes to the rules of the game. Players start off following
some "initial ruleset", which dictates how the rules can be changed. 
Once a rule change has been made, players then follow this new rule set.
Most importantly, the rules about how rule changes are made can
themselves be changed!

        This is where it tends to get mystical, because as a result of
these rule changes, the game you are playing will change from moment to
moment. The nature of the rule changing mechanism might change from 
democratic to capitalist, to communist, to whatever. Or the ability to
chnage the rules might be removed entirely - perhaps the game will turn
into chess, or tag, or snap. The future of the game is entirely in the
hands of the players.

        Most nomic enthusiasts seem to enjoy playing nomic in order to
experience the possibilities of different kinds of lawmaking processes,
and also to exercise their ingenuity in trying to discover loopholes
in the rules which give unusual results - mostly to the benefit of the
player. (This is called "scamming", and is lots of fun! :)

distinguish 'procedural' from 'substantive' games.  In substantive games, 
players play to earn points and win.  In procedural games, they try to tie 
the rules into knots, either for the logical fun of it or in order to win 
by paradox rather than by points. -- Peter Suber

        For the record, Nomic was conceived and designed by Peter Suber,
and first published in Douglas Hofstadter's column "Metamagical Themas"
in Scientific American in 1982, and later in Hofstadter's book, by the
same name. Peter revised the rules and published them in his own book,
"The Paradox of Self Amendment" in 1990. See section 6 below, for 
references.

2. Where can I get the rules?

* via FTP:

Peter Suber's original rules set is available at ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au, in
the directory: /pub/doc/nomic/rules.txt 

If anyone has any other Nomic-related files which they would like to be put 
up for FTP, just mail me and I'll see if I can include them at this site.

* via WWW:

Michael Norrish has a lot of Nomic related information in a World
Wide Web page at:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~trost/nomic/">http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~trost/nomic/</a>

(actually, this is a mirror of Michael's page, kept by Bill Trost, for use 
outside New Zealand. New Zealanders may prefer to access the original, at:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.comp.vuw.ac.nz/~michael/games/nomic/">http://www.comp.vuw.ac.nz/~michael/games/nomic/</a>)

This page (currently) includes:

- Suber's initial Nomic rule set.

- Rules &amp; other information for Agora and Tabula email games.

- Information regarding Nomic World MUD, including the intial rules set  
  and history files.

Geoff Wong also keeps a Nomic WWW page at: 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/~geoff/nomic.html">http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/~geoff/nomic.html</a>

There are also various WWW pages dedicated to individual online games. 
These are listed with the games in 3 below.
----

3. Is Nomic being played on the Net? Where?

There are currently, to my knowledge, four Nomic games being played
by email (sometimes called ENomic) at various sites on the Net.

Their players describe them as:

* Agora (aka Yoyo)                       <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic-discussion@teleport.com">&lt;nomic-discussion@teleport.com&gt;</a>

    Agora Nomic is the largest and most dynamic game of Nomic ever
    played. It has been in existence since July 1993, and since that time
    has voted on proposals at an average rate of about 50 per month. At
    time of writing (August 1994), there are about 190 active rules, and
    this number is growing, albeit quite slowly, since most proposals now
    concern themselves with amending or repealing previous rules.

    The "feel" of play in Agora Nomic is somewhat akin to being a member
    of parliament or congress, with all the social interaction which that
    implies.  Hence Agora Nomic can seem formidable to the inexperienced
    player.  However, this is largely offset by the uniquely welcoming
    and encouraging attitude Agora Nomic and its constituent players take
    towards new participants.

    Also, please note that the address of the game has now changed. Our
    new address is <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic-discussion@teleport.com">&lt;nomic-discussion@teleport.com&gt;</a> and new players may
    subscribe to this list by sending mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:Majordomo@teleport.com">&lt;Majordomo@teleport.com&gt;</a>
    with "subscribe nomic-discussion" in the body in the body of the 
    message. We are using <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au">&lt;nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au&gt;</a> as a backup,
    but all mail should be directed to teleport.com.

    The official mail (proposals, rule sets, phone books) are distributed on
    the <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic-official@teleport.com">&lt;nomic-official@teleport.com&gt;</a> mailing list, which can be subscribed
    to, by sending "subscribe nomic-official" to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:Majordomo@teleport.com">&lt;Majordomo@teleport.com&gt;</a>.

    Don Blaheta (aka Vanyel) now keeps a WWW page for Agora at:
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://shamino.quincy.edu/~blahedo/nomic.html">http://shamino.quincy.edu/~blahedo/nomic.html</a>

* Tabula (aka Reed)                                     <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic@reed.edu">&lt;nomic@reed.edu&gt;</a>

    We are conducting a dignified Nomic game at a relatively leisurely
    pace, with the intent of giving the participants plenty of time to
    take care of the other details of their life (work, classes,
    whatever). The game is designed to continue indefinitely, with
    Speakerhood passed on to a winner whenever some players receive 100
    points (at the moment).

    Subscriptions to the mailing list and the Ruleset may be obtained by
    mailing <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic-request@reed.edu">&lt;nomic-request@reed.edu&gt;</a> . We are currently limited to &lt;= 8
    players; to join, listen to the list for a while, and then petition
    the current players for entry.

* Fantasy Rules Committee (aka frc)                    <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:frc@nvg.unit.no">&lt;frc@nvg.unit.no&gt;</a>

    * Fantasy Rules Committee (aka frc)                    <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:frc@nvg.unit.no">&lt;frc@nvg.unit.no&gt;</a>

    The Fantasy Rule Game is a Nomiclike Game which is, like Nomic,
    played via a server.

    People propose Rules of which the only requirement is that they are
    consistent with all valid earlier Rules. The last Player succeeding
    in posting a valid Rule wins.

    Of course the Game stands and falls with a little bit of cooperation.
    A (first) Rule like "Rules are only valid if posted by me" is legal,
    winning and No Fun. (Still, varieties of the above with loopholes can 
    be.)

    Rounds may last from either a few Rules and up to 40. The latter
    record was set for a Round were the theme was the creation of a new
    board game. Other themes were (4D) Scrabble, Logical puzzles, 
    Strange planets and the Hellympics.
    More than 20 Rounds have been played since the game was invented about
    one and a half year ago as a `Committee' on the defunct Nomic Mud.

    If you want to play, you have to subscribe to the server:
    a message to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:majordomo@nvg.unit.no">&lt;majordomo@nvg.unit.no&gt;</a> will do.  The subject doesn't
    matter and the body should contain a line like "subscribe frc".  If 
    the body contains "help" on a line of its own you'll get instructions.
    If you send mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:frc-request@nvg.unit.no">&lt;frc-request@nvg.unit.no&gt;</a> you'll get back instructions
    specific to frc.

    The server itself has for address <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:frc@nvg.unit.no">&lt;frc@nvg.unit.no&gt;</a>. Any message sent
    there will bounce to all people subscribed to the list.

    For more info, check out anonymous ftp at ftp.nvg.unit.no:/pub/frc.

* Valparaiso (aka valpo)         c/o: Paul Nord <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:pnord@exodus.valpo.edu">&lt;pnord@exodus.valpo.edu&gt;</a>

    Our nomic game has been running for about a year and a half now.  
    Going on the 30th proposal.  It started independently of the 
    knowlege of any other game. It is therefore properly called "The One 
    True Nomic". For information about our game, I suppose that you can
    write to me. None of the other players want their names disclosed at
    this time. 

    The game operates out of Valparaiso University in Valparaiso Indiana.
    Initialy it was started by a few VU alums and some students.

    The rules are not made public.  We have a shared account that we use
    to hold the rules.

    Valpo now has a WWW page at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://kepler.valpo.edu/nomic/index.html">http://kepler.valpo.edu/nomic/index.html</a>

* Gnomic                                       <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:gnomic@FHI-Berlin.mpg.de">&lt;gnomic@FHI-Berlin.mpg.de&gt;</a>

    Information provided by Garth Rose (Ambassador for Agora Nomic):

    I have made contact with another eNomic through our own former Member 
    and PROSIRUP Founder Delphin.  It is called Gnomic, and its address is
    <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:gnomic@FHI-Berlin.mpg.de">gnomic@FHI-Berlin.mpg.de</a>.  One subscribes via gnomic-request@ the same
    address by sending:
    HELP
    SUB gnomic
    REV gnomic
    in the body of the message.

    There is a gnomic ftp site at denver.rz-berlin.mpg.de.  It has the 
    Ruleset, among other things.  It's in German - enjoy!

    There is also a gnomic WWW page at:
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/gnomic/gnomic.info.html">http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/gnomic/gnomic.info.html</a>.

* Fascist

    Fascist is designed to be completely undemocratic, at least to start
    with.  There are few initial rules, players propose new rules or rule
    changes and The Imperious Emperor says whether they are accepted or not.

    Fascist is now in the middle of Game 5. Rumour has it that they have
    become slightly more democratic, but I wouldn't bet on it. :)

    Fascist is played via a set of WWW pages at:
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/fascist/fascist.html">http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/fascist/fascist.html</a>

    The current rules and everything can be found at this site.
    The current Humble Scribe is Denis Howe <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:dbh@doc.ic.ac.uk">&lt;dbh@doc.ic.ac.uk&gt;</a>.
    Contact him for more information.

* Pokey

    Ed McGuire <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:emcguire@bucky.i2.com">&lt;emcguire@bucky.i2.com&gt;</a> has started a new E-mail Nomic
    game, using Suber's initial Rule set. E-mail him for more info.

    "We have decided to name our game Pokey, a label reflective of the
     speed of play." - Ed

4. What is this talk of Meta-Nomic?

    With the recent proliferation of Nomic games online, some people 
have begun talking about starting a game of "Meta-Nomic" - that is,
a game of Nomic in which each of the existing games act as "players".

    The idea is loosely based around the mapping of nomic games to nations
in the real world. So Meta-Nomic would make some provisions for trade
and negotiation between "nations", somewhat like the UN.

    Of course, the most attractive thing to most advocates of Meta-Nomic is
the possibility of Inter-Nomic WAR.

----

5. What is/was Nomic World? Where is it now?

Nomic World was a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) run by Geoff Wong and Steve
Gardner at Monash Uniersity, in Australia. Its sole purpose was to run
an extended game of Nomic. In its heyday, NW had over thirty players,
from places all around the world, making it the largest (known) game
of Nomic in the world!

Nomic world lasted for about 9 months, before the wizards were forced to
shut it down due to system problems and lack of time to administer it.
In that time, several hundred rules were made, and multiple scams 
pulled off (with various degrees of success.)

To find out more about Nomic World, read Steve Gardner's excellent game
summaries, which are part of Michael Norrish's WWW page. (See Q2 above)

Nomic world is currently in limbo. There has been some discussion of it
being resurrected at another site. If anyone is interested in doing this,
the old MUD code can be provided, and I would gladly give you any 
assistance I can. Please email me.

the initial set of rules which (I believe) they adopted.  Instead of 
having players propose rules in serial, they should do so in parallel, and 
then occasionally vote on some of the accumulated proposals.  That would 
not only permit a much larger number of players to participate, but it 
would simulate a legislative body better than the original rule set. -- Suber

The initial rules from Nomic World are available for FTP from 
ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au in the file: /pub/doc/nomic/nwrules.txt

Steve Gardner's summaries of the history of Nomic world are also at that 
site, in the file: summary.txt

6. What other Nomic-like games are there?

[If anyone knows of any others, I would love to include them. - MALCOLM]

* Bartok (aka Bartog?)

A card game, which begins very much like Uno, except that each time
a player wins a round, e gets to invent a new rule. Generally, new rules
are restricted by the players' sense of fairness, and meta-rules are not
allowed. The game is complicated by the initial rule that "If a player
asks a question, e must pick up a card."

This game is meant to be very silly, and can be lots of fun.

I have put the a file containing the initial rules, and some suggested
extras which I have played successfully in the past, up for ftp at 
ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au: pub/doc/nomic/bartog.txt

[Research is currently underway as to the origin of this game, and the
true spelling of its name. Any info would be appreciated. - MALCOLM]

* Mao

Mao is similar to Barto[gk]  but with the following important variations:

1) New players are not told the initial rule set (which is slightly different
from the Bartok one, and varies slightly (radically?) depending on which group
is playing it)

2) When someone goes out, they invent a new rule, which they do not tell the 
other players.

Gareth Rees has made a WWW page containing "the public rules of the game MAO" 
at: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/gdr11/mao-public.txt">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/gdr11/mao-public.txt</a>

Ted Helm claims that the name "Mao" is a corruption of "M.O.W." which 
stands for "My Own Way".

* Other

Geoff Wong's home page contains some links to pages about various political
games, which might interest a Nomic fan. It can be found at:

7. Books and references.

*    Title:     "The Paradox of Self-Amendment,
                    A Study of Logic, Law, Omnipotence, and Change."
     Author:    Peter Suber
     Publisher: Peter Lang Publishing
     Date:      1990
     ISBN:      0-8204-1212-0

     Description (by Suber):
       PSA is the first (so far the only) book-length study of self-reference 
     problems in law.  It focuses on one such problem from American 
     constitutional law, but in the discussion of it ranges widely over other 
     problems and other jurisdictions.  That one central problem is whether 
     the amendment clause of the constitution can be used to amend itself.  
     Alf Ross, a notable jurist and logician, argued that it cannot.  I argue 
     that it can, and show in addition that self-amendment has frequently 
     occurred in fact.  In the process of showing the permissibility of 
     self-amendment, I discuss much of the law of the U.S. federal amending 
     process, the theological paradox of omnipotence, the nature of paradox, 
     legal rationality, and legal change.  Nomic is Appendix 3 of the book.

        I can't recommend that every avid Nomic player buy the book, for it 
     costs $70 US.  But I can recommend that they persuade their local library 
     to do so!  The book would be helpful for anyone who took a serious 
     theoretical interest in the game or in the logic of self-amendment. 
     I can recommend this essay-length synopsis of the main argument of the
     book:

                   An early version of the rules, taken from the unpublished
     text of "The Paradox of Self-Amendment", with explanation and commentary
     by Suber about the purpose of the game and the possible directions it
     could take.
