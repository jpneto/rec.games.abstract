I've been meaning to reply to this for some time,
but we've been a bit busy here hosting a conference.  Anyway:-

After thinking about this for some time, namely about 3 seconds,
it occurs to me that this is correct!

A nice anecdote.  And probably not unique, either!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What could be easier?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed!  It DOES seem to be the simplest resolution of
the quad-connection-impasse problem.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
When playing on a square physical board, place pieces on
the cells and mark connections with another piece on the vertex.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Or better still, as it would need to be a "long" piece
(to indicate who's connected), place it atop the other two pieces.

Physical boards is just a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>teensy<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> problem, in having to use
extra types of pieces, but it hardly matters.  You may have
been thinking of just using a regular piece of the appropriate
colour to place on the vertex, but this also has the teensy
annoyance that then the pieces have to be noticeably smaller
than the cells, and tend to get lost.  But it's all irrelevant...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Simple, unambiguous, obvious.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I agree; and as you observe later, can be adapted to any
board at all, regardless of regularity, valencies or otherwise.

I withdraw my contenders from being regarded as good answers,
in favour of yours, an-@-nowhere, whoever you are.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Unlike some of the other rulesets, this rule doesn't
avoid the question of "How can we play Hex on a square board?"
by converting a game on a 4-valent 4444 board to a game
on a trivalent 488 board.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, in effect it still does, alas. It's just precisely that -
with the added rule, that when you play the second of two
diagonally adjacent pieces in octocells, you automatically get
played the intervening quadcell piece as well, if it's vacant.

As Quax is just the same, but with the quadcells needing to be
played as a full move, I might humbly suggest the name "QuikQuax"
for games played with this protocol; though 1st-come-1st-connected
is also great, and self-explanatory, though rather long, unless
abbreviated to FCFC which is also snappy (though no longer clear).

Anyway, what's in a name.  The idea is cool; and though I think
it DID cross my mind when I was thinking up Quax, I didn't
give it any more thought, so cannot lay any sort of claim.
Well done, an@nowhere!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
(And regardless of what Mark will say -- this IS a
generalization of Hex.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well I think events have shown that we need no longer worry
about what Mark may say.  There's no point arguing with
a spoiled brat, and we can best ignore him and hope his
Mummy will turn up soon and take him away.
