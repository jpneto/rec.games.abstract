A man stands by an isolated restaurant on a straight highway, 100 miles from
town. Along comes a car. The driver offers the man a lift.

"How far do you want to go?", asks the driver.
"I'm not fussy", said the man. "Drop me off at any point where the distance
between the restaurant and town is less than 30 miles greater than the
distance between the drop off point and town."

What is the closest the man could get to town? What is the furthest from
town he could end up?
