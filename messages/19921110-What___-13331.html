"Three-on-a-row in a 3^x space is rather easy to prove things about. That game
has (as far as playing something on a sheet of paper during lessons) long
been dead for me. 4-on-a-row in 2-d space is a bit more fun, but I seem to
have proved the the starter wins. How about 5-on-a-row? How about 3-player
4-on-a-row? Has anyone tried to prove who wins there?"

As far as I know the '5-on-a-row' game is proved to be won on a table 15x15
for the 1st player by some Japaneese.
Remark: 4-on-a-row in 4x4x4 table is good for the beginner as well.
