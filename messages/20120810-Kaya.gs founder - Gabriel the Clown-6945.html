A little background.  Gabriel the Clown touted his planned Go server
as the end all be all, loaded with features.  I knew he was full of
shit just because of how he comports himself.  He signs all of his
posts "Kaya founder".  Like, don't try to relate to him on a personal
level.  All you need to know is that he's in charge.

Someone recommended I talk to him about Redstone, so I did.  Big
mistake.  He comes back at me with this asinine "Get 20,000 Redstone
players and I'll think it over."  Then he proceeds to lecture me about
my "well known" Internet hooliganism.  I basically told him to fuck
off at that point.  Maybe I do have a shiotty attitude, but Gabriel
the Clown is not someone to lecture anyone on their attitude.  Early
on, someone offered him some excellent advice for his server and he
publicly derided that person, calling him a "motherfucker".

Fast forward.  Now Gabriel has released a limited membership beta
server and the complaints are mounting.  There's lag and an arbitrary,
extremely low limit on the timer setting.  Long games are totally
precluded.  A bunch of people complained about this on L19 and he
basically just dismissed their concerns with semantic inanity.

"Its a given that there has to be some sort of upper-limit.  In the
same way a 1 minute absolute time should not be rated, a 9999 absolute
time rated game should not get started. Its guaranteed to end in an
upset game."

This jerk-off is the Richard Hutnik of server programmers.

It's fucking ironic.  There's no way Gabriel the Clown will ever get
20,000 Go players at this rate.  What a fucking buffoon.

Update: Now Gabriel the Clown, in response to all the dissension, is
backpedaling 100 miles an hour.  "We are all on the same side here, we
are all go players, trying to look for a better solution. Lets keep
that in mind."

Let's keep in mind that you're a fucking buffoon, Gabriel, in way over
your head.  Your ears are clogged with shit that seeped out from your
shit packed cranial cavity.  There's no way out for you.  Better start
writing checks to return the $13K in donations you accepted.
