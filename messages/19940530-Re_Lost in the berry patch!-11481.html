|&gt;   The board is a hexagon with a center, and one of the edges removed,
|&gt;   like this:
|&gt; 
|&gt;      0-----0
|&gt;     / \   / \
|&gt;    /   \ /   \

|&gt; 
|&gt;   There are 2 players, each player has 3 pieces on the board. The pieces
|&gt;   inhabit one of the "0"s above; the lines between the "0"s indicate
|&gt;   valid moves from that location. The goal of the game is to leave your
|&gt;   opponant without a move. The pieces are initially placed around the 
|&gt;   perimeter of the board, alternating. i.e. the center is vacant, and
|&gt;   the order of the pieces is (white,black,white,black,white,black) around
|&gt;   the edge.
|&gt; 
|&gt;   I haven't analyzed the game, but it ought to be a piece of cake. 

Should be!  There're only 30 essentialy different positions!  60 counting
player-to-move.  So it ought to be a lot simpler than e.g. tic-tac-toe.

I'll leave a full analysis to the dedicated trivia solvers.

However, I'd just like to mention that this game is very similar to one
mentioned by R.C. Bell in his classic "Bard and Table games; (part 2)". He
describes a game allegedly played by Maoris, called "Mu Torere", though I've
never heard of it over here in Kiwiland. (He mentions it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>may<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be partly
due to Euro-settler influence; but I've still never jeard of it, nor has
anyone I know.)

The object of the game is the same; but there are eight spots around the
outside and no gap; and four pieces each.  They start (as above) around the
edge, but in two blocks of four, rather than alternating.

As this would be an instant win to player one, there is an extra rule. There
are actually two variants mentioned:-

(i) One may not move a piece from edge to centre unless at least one of its
    neighbors was the opposite color.

(ii) Ditto; but this restriction applies only to each player's first 2 moves.

As he say, either way it is a trivial draw; the danger positions are simple
and easy to see coming. He gives a few examples; but so simple it's not worth
typing them in.    

I wonder if the "Kix" people knew of this earlier version ?
