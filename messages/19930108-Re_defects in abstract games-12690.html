In my (not very sophisticated) understanding of Chess, the weaker player
can try to reach a draw by forcing the stronger player into a situation
where any departure from a repetitive sequence is a disaster.  If the
repetition were simply ruled to be illegal, the idea of what constitutes
a strong position would change.  But the rule that no captures for some
number of turns is a draw could be unchanged.  It seems to me that this
is fairly simple, and removes many draws.  Is it a bad idea for some
other reason, am I missing something, or do some people consider the
draws desirable?

i was just thinking of another mod to lower (but not eliminate) the
occurence of draws in chess.  we all know that pawns can be promoted
to other peices by reaching the 8th rank.  what if...what if you win
the game if you can promote your king to the 8th rank (score a touchdown,
so to speak)?  this idea was stolen from hnelatfel (YUCK i'm bad at sp)
and from another game, pensate.  many of those "book draws" when the
material dwindles sufficiently, are now suddenly up for grabs.
