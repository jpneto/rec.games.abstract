What if you form two mor more vertical words?  Does only the longest
count, or do you get extra for the others?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Only the longest counts.  I did try a version where you got extra
points for more vertical words, but this made the analysis paralysis
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>even worse<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  As it is, the main source of analysis seems to be this
vertical word scoring mechanism, and allowing multiple vertical word
scores just made it worse.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It seems like you can obstruct by playing the words "A" or "I".
Granted, they won't score much, but some players may do this if they
can't play anything better.  Maybe you should limit word lengths to
three or more letters (many word games do).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is a strong incentive not to obstruct in this way.  If you play
only tiny words, and your opponent plays only long words, your
opponent will have a great deal of freedom in how he constructs his
words, which will lead to long vertical words that you will have an
extremely hard time matching.  Consistent short words seem to lead to
bad defeats.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Why not let the falsely challenged word count double instead of letting
the challenger lose a turn?  This seems simpler.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I chose the challenge rule to match scrabble, since this is what
people are familiar with.  But agree that yours is probably a bit
better, not in the least because it means the stakes are higher for
longer words.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
One change that might reduce the number of sensible choices is to make a
word score the number of letters it shares with the opponent's word
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>minus<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the number of letters it has that the opponent's word does not.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I tried this once before, and I had mixed feelings about it.  One
issue I had is that it made the game feel too static to me.  What I
mean is, in a game with scoring, it helps if there's some potential
for big, game-changing scores.  Like when you bonus and triple word
score at the same time in scrabble, or huge captures in Go.  This
version of the game didn't have it; it was more a game of inches,
which felt a bit tedious.  I should mention however, that I didn't
play this version with the anagram bonus included, and that might
change things.  So I'll go back and try it.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The idea is that you would get no benefit for looking for longer words,
so you stop searching for better solutions earlier.  Also, you can
remove the extra bonus for anagrams.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Even with the original rules I posted above, there's little incentive
to maximize word length.  The reason is that, if you make a word
that's longer than your opponent's word, you don't get any extra
points for the extra letters, and in addition, you are setting your
opponent up for a big score on his next turn.  On the other hand
though, it is easier to generate long vertical words with long
horizontal words, so there is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> incentive to go long.  Not sure
how much yet though.

Because the vertical scoring seems to be the source of the problem, I
think your instincts are right on.  I just wish that your subtraction
idea could be modified somehow so that big scores become possible.
Another good thing about the vertical scoring, which I wish there was
some way to preserve, is it introduces an obvious an understandable
long-term strategy component.  Since it takes many turns to construct
a long vertical word, you have to plan ahead to try to make it
happen.  That is one aspect I like.

You could also make play simultaneous: After each round, you swap grids
and secretly add a new word underneath the bottom word.  You reveal
simultaneously and score.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like this idea alot.  I'll definitely try it out. thanks.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You could add that a player has to finish in
no more than 30 seconds (or 15?) once the other declares that he is
done.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm a little hesitant to impose time limits.  Feels a little
artificial to me.  Good games seem to impel you to making moves
without being forced to.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Simultaneous play also allow more than two to play, since there is less
down time.  You could also do away with the random seeding and let each
player write the first word before passing his grid on to the next.  You
can require these initial words to be exactly (say) four letters long
and give penalty to players that use the same initial word.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like this idea as well, and will try it.

Thanks very much.
