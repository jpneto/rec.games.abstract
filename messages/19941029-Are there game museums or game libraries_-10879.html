Are there any game museums, game libraries, or game archives? 

I am interested in identifying the general characteristics of good game
designs.  It would be helpful if I could study good games.  However, it
would be quite expensive for me to buy all the games I would like to review.
Also, many of the games I would like to study are no longer available.

I know that the Library of Congress has copies of copyrighted games.  Is
their collection open to researchers?

Do any of the trade associations for game publishers have game libraries?

Does anyone have any other suggestions for me?

For whatever it's worth, I have a special interest in business and
economic games.

Thanks for your suggestions!

Steve Bell
