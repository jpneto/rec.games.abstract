Some mechanisms in new games appear contrived to me.  I can't think of
an example here and now, but at least one of Sid Sackson's games struck

Contrivance is a good thing.  No abstract game, including Checkers,

Guess I'm torn on this point.  On one hand, invention always does seem
to involve imitation in one way or another.  There's no new thing under
the sun.

But OTOH, I wince at games like Chebache, which is admittedly a
contrived mixture of three classic games.  It almost seems like the
designer cheated.

Nor is any chess variant ever as satisfying to me as standard
International Chess.  Time-honored tradition, for better or worse, is a
big part of what makes a game seem classy.  And while maybe I ought to
be ashamed of it, I have to admit that classiness is important to me.

Thus, I could get into shogi or xiangqi, because they have time-honored
traditions of their own.  But I'll never think much of "shuffle chess"
or any of the many variants on the Chess Variants Web site.  They all
come across as "contrived."

Admittedly it's purely subjective, though.  Detractors of my POV might
quote composer Gustav Mahler, who said, "Tradition is merely an excuse
for slovenliness."
