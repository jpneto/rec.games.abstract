Hi guys.

I was wondering about the Pie Rule (which, i think, is to put 2 of
Black and 1 of White in a "Go-like" game and let the other player pick
which color to play).

 From the context of this group, it seems that putting 1 stone and
letting the other side pick is apparently Not As Good, in the goal of
eliminating the advantage of going First (or Second in some games).

Also, I have seemed to gather that a 1-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2... move
sequence is also not clearly eliminating any such advantage.

I definitely don't like 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-... like Progressive Chess -
smacks of the multiple-Universes created instantaneously for every
quantum event.

My question is:

Where would I find studies on this issue?

For example, imagine Go using 1-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-....

Ko rule? Not NEEDED, player can take &amp; fill.  Or if he takes and plays
elsewhere, same as it ever was.  Existing joseki?  Out the window.
Existing books on Life &amp; death problems?  Out the window.

Have there been any serious studies to this simple modification?  I
would hope so.  Because it would really be surprising if such a simple
mod had not been proven unworkable already.  It must be an unpleasant
variation to play.  Perhaps the -2-2-2 part creates instabilities that
suffer from serious Analysis Paralysis.   But imagine the 1st Go
game.....


Thanks for giving a listen.
