Congratulations to Charles and Jeff, whose bots squared off in 
the 3-base competition. 

The first battle had the Charlesbot playing first.  The game may be
viewed graphically at:

Commentary: Both sides emphasized stacking early, with Charlesbot
putting all
but one reserve down at the outset. Charlebot by turn 22 became 
enmeshed in an increasingly nasty set of traps, forcing it 
to "retreat" into the center to avoid compounding losses. By turn 
32, big exchanges were threatened by both sides, with the Charlesbot 
hunkering down as the Jeffbot lashed out with attacks. With 3 
captured pods and no reservese, Charlesbot nevertheless gained tempo 
on turn 38 and looked to be making a comeback. By turn 42, I felt 
that the Charlebot position had drawn even, given the lack of 
structure to the Jeffbot's position. (Do you agree?) But 
Charlesbot dithered to turn 52, allowing the Jeffbot to build a 
beachhead and play for exchanges. Even as late as turn 56, I felt 
that Charlesbot still had some life in it, but Jeffbot gathered a 
base-striking force in the Charlesbot's back lines and moved in for 
the kill. A very interesting see-saw battle.

Game 2 was rather different. Again, Charlesbot fell behind early, 
but gained tempo and an overwhelming advantage in the center by turn 
38. But rather attacking by moving 46-45, it continued to dither 
and let the Jeffbot regroup. Never let an offensive opportunity 
slip away if you are behind in Octi, because your opponent will 
convert your wasted tempos into prongs and pods! Charlesbot's move 
into the center on turn 42 was poorly coordinated with the pods in 
its formation (the sequence of moves at 42 and 44 are in some sense 
backward, perhaps due to limited search horizon), and the Charlesbot 
quickly ran into snags (all the while, with an enemy pod in its back 
lines). Five turns of costly exchanges left the Charlesbot down 4-2 
in pods and out of reserves.

So Jeffbot wins the 9x9 3-base tourney 2-0. Jeff has now walked off 
with the 6x7 AI championship and both of the 9x9 AI crowns for 2002. 

All in all, two fascinating and instructive games. Do check them 
out if you have a chance.  They show how AI is becoming increasingly
skillful at playing Octi (especially the "Fast" and "Kids" variants),
while at the same time illustrating how far they must go in order to
play competitively against high-quality opponents.  I'll try to put
example versions of Jeff's bots at the Octi on-line site, so that you
can try them out for yourself.

Cheers,
Don
