]&gt;&gt; it is a win.  All that needs to be shown is that playing to the center

There is a misunderstanding here. What was in question was proving that
moving in the center was a win for the first player, not that the first player
has a win.

] 
]&gt;What you have just argued is that the center move seems intuitively
]&gt;likely to win.  Everyone understands that.  The difference between that
]&gt;and a proof is rather vast.  
] 
] Not so.  Perhaps you're not satisfied because the proof is not constructive;
] indeed, it is not a constructive proof.  Perhaps a better way of stating the
] theorem is that the second player does not have a winning strategy.
] 
]&gt;The lacuna is that little matter of
]&gt;"playing to the center hex is at least as good...."

] taken away.

Yes, having the center is better than no move at all. However showing that it
is better than some other moves or good enough to win takes some work.
The obvious symmetric move strategy doesn't work since it has to be a mirror
move and there aren't mirror moves for some moves because the board size is
odd.

] 
]&gt;It's like looking for a proof that moving first is an advantage in go.
] 
] Go is a completely different game.  Draws are possible, wins are determined
] differently, pieces can be taken.  
] 
]&gt;That is obviously true, and from experience we can even quantify the
]&gt;advantage fairly precisely.  
] 
] It's not so obvious, but it certainly appears that in Go and Chess that the
] first move is a strong strategic advantage.
] 
]&gt;But a proof is not only not forthcoming, it
]&gt;is so far beyond what we know how to prove as to be completely
]&gt;inaccessible.
