Since the board is a non-rhombic parallelogram, this terminology is a
little vague.  The diagonals of the parallelogram touch only two hex
centers each, their endpoints at opposite corners of the
parallelogram.  I suspect you are talking about lines that cut the
board in half parallel to the sides.  The line parallel to the odd
side touches no hex centers, the line parallel to the even side
touches a row of hex centers.

Thus ``at the centrally symmetric point.''  It doesn't matter how you
cut the board in half, this is about reflection through the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>center<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>

Well, the non-rhombic parallelogram isn't mirror-symmetric.  If we
allow a sort of distorted mirror-symmetry by pretending it's a
rectangle, we can reflect through a line parallel to a pair of sides.
If this is what you mean, then there is an obvious problem if the
shorter side is even, because then the shorter line of symmetry goes
through hex centers, and what is the response to a move on this line?
Perhaps mirror-symmetrically through the center of that line?  It
doesn't matter, as we see below.

Well, even then it doesn't work, whether the short side is even or odd.
Look at these two partial games, in which each move by X has been
answered by O (distorted) mirror-symmetrically through the marked line.

         \                   \
     - - - - - -        - - - - - - -
      - O O X X -        - - - - - - -
       - X X O O -        - O O - X X -
        - - - - - -        - X X - O O -
         - - - - - -        - - - - - - -
               \             - - - - - - -
                                    \

In either case it is now X to move and win even if O abandons this
strategy, even if X passes (and this is a game without zugzwang).
Both games generalize to larger boards.

There may be a winning strategy for the second player on the Nx(N-1)
board, but I would be quite surprised if it's a simple one.
