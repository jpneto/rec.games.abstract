I don't follow this comment.
Could you elaborate please?

I took the phrase "evenly even" from the nomenclature of magic squares, the
size of the square is a multiple of four.

The order 3 hexhex board is evenly-even, having 12 cells in the perimeter.
Since it's likely for the game to end tied ...

.... add a ring of 12 goal areas with what I misleadingly called a "half-cell
twist" as shown in the original diagram ...

The game GAIA (Connection Games, page 110; invented by Mark Thompson 2002)
is very nearly Free-Y on an oddly-even board. His board has 18 cells in the
perimeter.  He tries to get around the problem of an even perimeter by
having a slightly different object:

A player wins by either

1) Completing a chain of his pieces across the board between two opposed
cells, or
2) forming a Y that renders any Type 1 connection by the opponent
impossible.

A randomly filled board will NOT always have exactly one discernable winner
and the game may end with a race.
