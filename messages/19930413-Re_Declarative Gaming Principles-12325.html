Well, just an afterthought: In a procedural game rules may be declarative,but
computation is not. In a declarative game both rules and resolution will be
declarative. Furthermore, in a declarative game resolution will not only be
dependent on the game-situation as in procedural games, but it will actually
be DRIVEN by the game-situation.

This was more what I thought when I saw the topic line of this
discussion. Procedural (or imperative) programming languages describe
how to reach a goal by consecutive modifications to a state. This is
indeed similar to most games, where you move, change, place or remove
pieces on a board or lines on a bit of paper (or in Nomic, a set of
rules). Declarative languages describe a relation or function between
the input and output without specifying any sequence other than that
imposed by data-dependence, nor any implementation-independent concept
of "state".

What makes a game is the ability to choose. In "procedural" games, you
normally have choices as a state develops, e.g. at every move. But you
can also have games where you only specify an initial condition and
then just resolve the outcome. This in itself does not make a game
declarative - CoreWars is an example of a procedural game where the
state is changed at every turn, but where players only specify an
initial state and then watch for developments.

Purely declarative games are games like the one played recently on the
net, where each contestant choose a number, and the smallest unique
number is the winner. This game is a bit too simplistic to interest a
lot of people in the long run, but the idea is there: only the initial
configuration determines the outcome, and no "intermediate" states are
needed to resolve the game.
