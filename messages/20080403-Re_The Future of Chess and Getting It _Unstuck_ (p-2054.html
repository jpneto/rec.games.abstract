Well, one can already play a lot of different board games besides
Chess. Since Chess with one or two extra pieces, even with people like
Capablanca behind it, never took off, it seems like there isn't enough
interest.

Look at Glinski's hexagonal chess. It is the most popular hexagonal
chess version, but whoever hears of it?

It seems like most chessplayers don't want too much excitement. Maybe
they figure that people who want excitement and change will play
Dungeons and Dragons. Or, maybe they would like something regular
Chess does not have - but none of the variations anyone has suggested
are any better than regular Chess.
