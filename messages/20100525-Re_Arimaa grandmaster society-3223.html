Mark,

Once more, I'm asking for evidence.  A comment in the chat room is not
really evidence, is it?  I think you took the comment out of context,
and ask that you please do further research before concluding that a
game is flawed.  I don't really care if you want to or not - it's just
a game, and if you want to play it, or learn more about it great.  If
you don't, OK.

If you want to make statements about a game being flawed, however, I
think that you should have some data to back up your claim.

The comment to which you refer had to do with the theoretical
possibility that it might happen that a game would go so long as to be
to all intents and purposes, a draw.  This was a theoretical
discussion that has as of today, no basis in actual gameplay.

For games played between experts, I recommend viewing the annual world
chamionship games:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/wc/">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/wc/</a>

please judge for yourself whether these appear to be drawish.

If time controls are not to your liking, I recommend looking at the
postal games.  A good place to start is the 2009 postal mixer in which
a player could take hours or days for each more:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/tourn/postal/2009/showGames.cgi">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/tourn/postal/2009/showGames.cgi</a>

The 2010 postal mixer is underway currently:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/tourn/postal/2010/showGames.cgi">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/tourn/postal/2010/showGames.cgi</a>

For a more interesting perspective, I recommend viewing some of the
commented games.  This is a good example:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/video/go/chessandgo2009WC.htm">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/video/go/chessandgo2009WC.htm</a>
There are many more commented games that can be found at the Arimaa
web site.

Currently, the draw rate for Arimaa is 0%.  It used to be possible to
reach a draw, but there was a rule change a few years back that
resolved that, and now there just aren't any draws.  You can check the
game history on the site to check this fact.
