Yesterday I wrote about Sid Sackson's 1969 book <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>A_Gamut_of_Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
from memory.  From looking in the book (``You can observe a lot just
by watching.''  Stengel or Berra?) I've got a few additions and
corrections.

He got Martin Gardner to write some pretty ripe cover blurbs, calling
Sackson ``the country's leading game inventor, collector, and expert
on game history'' and <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Gamut<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> ``the most important book on games to
appear in decades.''  Personally, I think Gardner is being too modest
about his own books.

The organization that Sackson was president of is called ``New York
Game Associates.''  While I had assumed it was a fan club, I suppose
it could be a trade association or a private company.  Does anyone
know what it was, or what's become of it?

I pretty badly misremembered the game ``Hold That Line'' yesterday.  I
was right about board being a rectangular array of points, and players
take turns drawing a straight line from one point to another, possibly
going through other points.  The difference is that each line but the
first must share just one endpoint with the path formed by the
previous lines.  No line may otherwise intersect a previous line, even
at an endpoint.  Play continues until no more moves are possible.

As I mentioned, oblique lines are allowed, but it is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> made clear
whether oblique lines are restricted to forty-five degree angles.  I
extend this to three versions of the game: n.o.l., r.o.l., and u.o.l.,
in which oblique lines are respectively not allowed, restricted, and
unrestricted.

I was right that in normal play (last player to move wins), an obvious
first-player win exists in the r.o.l. and u.o.l. versions, and in the
n.o.l. version on all boards with an odd side (if you don't see how
send email; if you do don't spoil it), but I do not know who wins in
normal play n.o.l. on 2Nx2M boards.  Are there any takers on this last
problem, or on the misere version?  Sackson apparently noticed that
the misere version is the hard one, for he says ``the player who was
forced to make the last line is the loser!''
