Please note that the NS player can ensure a loop with just 2 stones!
The EW player has no such option.

Well of course the NS player can ensure a loop with just 2 stones.
That's because there are already 2 stones oriented from N to S on the
board!!  What the fuck does this prove??

That you are too dimwitted to follow a simple explanation.

Are we learning anything yet???

Yep.  I'm learning that you're even more fat headed than I thought.

You are beyond help.  People try to help you out and you bite
the hand that feeds you.   Fine, if you want to live your life
like that, go ahead; but you'll have to do it without me.

I have recently learned by private email that Mark Steere has
in the past got into inumerable &amp; unending flamewars,
that are chiefly due to his sociopathic nature.
Whatever his basic problem is, is not my problem.

Please go ahead and have the last word, Mark,
as I'm sure you will insist on.  I shall be neither replying
to it nor reading it.  I'm finished with you.  You're hopeless!

Your obsessive compulsion with claiming standard games
as your own, and with priority generally, are a joke.

YOU, are a joke.    Goodbye.

Bill Taylor.
