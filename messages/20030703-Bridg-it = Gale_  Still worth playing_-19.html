Just the other day someone mentioned this game, and how it has been broken
by a relatively simple winning strategy being found.

But it is a lovely-looking game, and I have often wondered, can the game 
be repaired by PIE?

I presume this is called PIE because of its analogy to "you-cut-and-I-choose"
for pies and cakes.  Theoretically, this leaves the advantage with the chooser,
as someone else noted; but in practice this isn't a problem because with most
games no-one has too much of an idea whether most close positions are a win
for the one or the other.   And though most would prefer to be chooser for
cakes and pies, the cutter has (to some extent) a bigger chance to
specify the direction the game will take, so I doubt there would be
any lack of takers to be cutter in most games.

Anyway:  can Gale be saved by this form of Equalization, as I prefer to
call it?  Or does the winning strategy flow over to be able to analyze
ANY position as a win or loss?

It may have to be 2-move or even 3-move Equalization, of course.  
e.g. in 3-move, the cutter would play a move for black, a move for white,
and a move for black, leaving the board with white to move.  
Then the chooser would choose whether to be black or white.

So does anyone know about Bridgit?  Can it be saved this way?
