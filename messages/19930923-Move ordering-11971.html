I think I now understand Alpha-Beta (thanks, Ken Sloan!).

I've cross-posted to rec.games.abstract because this is relevant to all
abstract games, not just chess.  Please trim the newsgroups line if
your posting is non-chess, or chess-only in scope.

The remainder of this posting contains virtually no facts.  It's just
an attempt to start a discussion.

------

It's obvious that a trying good moves first improves alpha-beta
performance.  I'm somewhat baffled as to what a good move-ordering
might look like.  It seems like a chicken-and-egg proglem:  How do I
tell the good moves from the bad BEFORE I do the search?

The best thing I can think of is to make each proposed move, call your
evaluation function, and sort on this result to get the move-ordering
for the recursive search.

But doing 30 board evaluations just to get a move ordering seems
computationally expensive.  Is something simpler usually done?
Something like "checks, captures, piece moves, pawn moves" (for chess)
perhaps?

Assuming the second choice, an idea that occurs to me is:

	Take a large database of master-level games, and compare the
	move made to its position in the ordering of several proposed
	heuristics.

Hmmm... of course, for the purpose of testing, a program could do this
on its own searches.  Something like, "in evaluating this position,
move-ordering heuristic A would have given the result faster than
heuristic B."  (But this analysis would only be valid with alpha-beta
turned off for the test (?)).

Analyzing the program's own searches gives results that are 100%
accurate for the program, but searching a large database would allow
thousands of times as many moves to be evaluated for their place in the
ordering.

So, now that I've babbled about some half-baked ideas, what is REALLY
done?
