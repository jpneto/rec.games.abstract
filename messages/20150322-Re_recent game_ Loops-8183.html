I guess Loops-F would be equivalent to Begird (with 1 cell islands) except that you could play Loops on an ordinary hex hex board with no possibility of a draw, a trade-off between an ugly board and an extra rule - a fair exchange.  In Loops-F, in case you and your opponent each have a loop spanning fifty percent of the perimeter - an outcome that wouldn't be unheard of and which would become increasingly likely with advancing skill - you would resolve the outcome by comparing the areas of the respective loops together with the areas they control.
