	Ok, this may be a stupid question, but is anyone interested in Magic: 
The Gathering?   I just picked it up a couple of days ago and was wondering 
where I could talk about it on the net.  This seems to be the closest I could 
find.  Anybody else play?  I would appreciate any comments you have about this 
really cool card game.

I think its a great game myself.

There is a lot of discussion on this game on:
  rec.games.board
(in fact, it is dominating the group to the extent that there is a lot of 
discussion on forming a group devoted to "MtG")

You can also subscribe to a digest of questions about MtG answered by company 
representatives (Wizards of the Coast) by sending a message to:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:listserv@wizards.com">listserv@wizards.com</a>
with the message
  subscribe gg-l <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:your@net.name">&lt;your@net.name&gt;</a>

You can also ftp information on it from marvin.macc.wisc.edu

Note:  the game is an interesting set of rules played with hundreds of 
different unique cards, many of which have the effect of changing or bending 
the rules.  This results in a number of possibly bizarre juxtapositions of rule 
changes / card plays.  The net is mainly devoted to these strange questions.  
The game actually plays much more smoothly than the proliferation of net 
questions would lead you to suspect.
