It is interesting that a 67 year old man could be World Champion of
checkers.  Not meaning to start any sort of checkers vs .... debate
but it IS interesting that it would be next to inconceivable for a 67
year old to be world champion of chess, for instance (I don't know
about go -- doesn anyone else?).  Anyway, for those out there who know 
more about checkers than I, why is there this difference?

Two factors:

Experience.  
	The more you play, the more you know about the openings.  There
	is no substitute for experience.  With Chinook, our biggest
	obstacle has been trying to overcoming the 50 years that Tinsley
	has been studying the game.

Stamina.
	A typical tournament checkers game often lasts less than an
	hour (but they often play 4 in a day).  Some games are over in
	5 minutes because both sides play the standard lines of play
	and then they quickly agree to a draw.
