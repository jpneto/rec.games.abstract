This is a very important rule in the game of Xiangqi (Chinese Chess).
In International Chess, the Knights' movements and powers are restricted by
the pawn structure in the opening and middle game.

However in Xiangqi, without such rule, the soldiers are not 
able to restrict the movements of the Horse the same way as the pawns do.

The Horse will become very active very early in the game.
And all the known tactics and strategies of the game will have to be
redefined. This becomes a new game altogether. See what happen if you
implement such an 'obstacle' rule for Knights in International Chess.
