Hi -

I am looking for the rules of a game named mancala, also 
known as wori or wari.  

It is an african board game that uses a board with multiple hollowed
out pockets, which are filled with stones.  Two players move
the stones around, and so on... (I am not clear on the rules,
on reason I am looking for them :).

Someone I know was telling me about the version of the game that
he had bought, and the rules he described sounded slightly different
from the ones that I remembered, so I am actually looking for
rules as well as variations...

Thanks for any info that anyone can offer...
