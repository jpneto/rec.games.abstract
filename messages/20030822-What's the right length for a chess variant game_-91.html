Hi all,

I've invented a chess variant in which games tend to be about 30 to 45 moves
(per player) long. Do people think this is about the right length for a
game? Perhaps attention spans and lifestyles have changed such that being
shorter than FIDE chess is a good thing - or perhaps that sort of mentality
is completely against what chess-type games are supposed to be about.

Curiously, many changes to the board size and number of pieces in my variant
have not changed the length much. Is there a chess variant theory website or
book which explains how you can modify a variant to alter properties such as
game length?

Also, the captures tend to happen in sequences, with a bloodbath of 5-10
half-moves, seperated by 5-10 half-moves in which repositioning takes place.
In a way, this resembles a medieval war more closely than standard chess
does. Do people think this is a good property for a chess variant?
Personally, I think this is more exciting than FIDE chess, in which captures
tend to happen in pairs of equal value, and the single unpaired capture
decides the winner of the game. I would appreciate a variety of voices on
this, even if they are saying the same thing as each other. Thanks to all
who reply - the game will be uploaded to Zillions as soon as I'm happy with
it.
