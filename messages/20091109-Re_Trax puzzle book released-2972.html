Maybe you can figure out some tricky positions while you're fucking
yourself, Vintershitz.

Dedication?  Here, let my try and put it all in perspective for you,
Vintershitz.  You really want to know why I find Trax annoying?  Trax
was the most over promoted game in the history of mankind.  There was
a period of a few years where every time you turn around,

ONLY 200 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE NEXT TRAX TOURNAMENT!!!!
ONLY 199 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE NEXT TRAX TOURNAMENT!!!!
ONLY 198 DAYS LEFT ...

Then at the end of it all, 6 people show up for the fucking
tournament, including the initiator of this thread.  Then comes the
stunning announcement.  So-and-so wins the tournament for the nth year
in a row.  Congratulations!  There were like 5 other people in the
fucking tournament!  Holy shit!!

Of the 15 sites my games are played at, how many of them do you think
have Trax?  Two!!  You think I'm jealous of Trax because a handful of
people bought into the hype and someone compiled a puzzle
collection??  Guess again, moron.

Here's a quote from the "official" Trax site: "One of the unique
features of TRAX is that it has the potential to be played to
infinity."  Vintershitz, if you've listened to a word I've said over
the years, you'd know I couldn't possibly admire a game like that.
There are a small number of games I do admire, including Forms by
Steven W. Meyers and Metamorphosis by Greg van Patten.  Trax isn't one
of them, idiot.
