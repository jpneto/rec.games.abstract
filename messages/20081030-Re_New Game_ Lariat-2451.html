Nice winning condition!   Beautifully win/loss complementary, as we

Thanks Bill.

Unfortunately, it seems to me to be a huuuuuuge advantage
to be the first player to grab the centre spot.  So even playing
with a move-exchange equaliser isn't going to be much good.

Yes, it's an automatic win for the first player to get the center cell
when played on a regular hexagon.  Even a multi-recursion pie rule
wouldn't make it equitable.  I recently updated the rule sheet to
really emphasize that Lariat is intended to be played on the surface
of a cylinder with one open end.  The regular hexagon boards on the
rule sheet are there only to explain the rules and should not be used
for play.

The circumference of the cylinder should equal the center-to-lip
distance (cylinder radius + cylinder length), both 12 cells in the
cylinder diagram on the rule sheet.  That's my rough estimate for
making the job of claiming all the lip cells in sequence and the job
of extending a sequence directly from center to lip equally
difficult.  A computer analysis would undoubtedly show my guess to be
wrong, due to anomalies in the topography, etc., but in any case it's
no longer an automatic win for the first player to get the center cell
when played on such a cylinder.  The center cell should be about as
strategically valuable as the average cell - that's the theory anyway.

Lariat should be available online very soon, and eventually at a few
different sites.  I'll make an announcement here when it comes online
and I'll be happy to challenge you then.  Hopefully someone will
program a 3D version of Lariat with the ability to rotate the
cylinder.  That'd be interesting.

A little background: I discovered the "lariat principle" years ago
when messing around with tetrahedrons, but I quickly realized the
inordinately high strategic value of the tip-of-the-pyramid cell so I
didn't release it as a game.  Over the years I've tried to come up
with a game for a cylinder, always coming up empty handed.  Recently
it dawned on me to use the lariat principle on a cylinder.  It's a tad
irksome that it took so long for that combination to occur to me, but
better late than never I suppose.
