THE CMG SEVENTH COMPUTER OLYMPIAD

Maastricht, The Netherlands
July 5-11, 2002

J.W. Hellemons and H.J. van den Herik

Maastricht, The Netherlands


The CMG 7th Computer Olympiad is a multi-games event in which all of the
participants are computer programs. The purpose is to find the strongest
programs at each of the games, partly as an academic exercise and partly
because the competitions are fun. This year's Computer Olympiad takes
place from July 5 to 11 and will be played at the Universiteit
Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands. The organizing committee
consists of: H.H.L.M. Donkers, J.W. Hellemons (chair), H.J. van den
Herik, H.M.J. den Hoed, P.A.M. van der Krogt, and J.W.H.M. Uiterwijk. We
are planning tournaments for at least 16 different games:

Amazons, Awari, Backgammon, Bridge, Chess [the 10th World Computer Chess
Championship], Chinese Chess, 8x8 Draughts, 10x10 Draughts, Gipf, Go,
Hex, Lines of Action, Othello, Poker, Scrabble, and Shogi.

We are willing to host more games, such as Tamsk, Zï¿½rtz, Twixt and Onyx
but we do not know of the existence of adequately playing programs.
Therefore we are awaiting suggestions on games to be adopted and
proposals of programmers of games not included in the list above.

For each game a 2002 tournament will take place provided that at least
two programs enter the tournament for that particular game. The detailed
tournament schedule will not be announced until the closing date for
entries which is May 10, 2002. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals will be
awarded to the leading programs in each tournament. There will be no
cash prizes. The chess competition of the Computer Olympiad will be a
special event, since it is adopted by the ICCA as the 10th World
Computer Chess Championship (WCCC 2002).

The Tournament Director of the Computer Olympiad will be Professor Jaap
van den Herik from the Computer Science Department of the Universiteit
Maastricht.

The rules of the CMG 7th Computer Olympiad will be published on our
website (see below).

The entry fees for the Olympiad are as follows: Amateur:
US $ 25
Semi-professional:
US $ 250
Professional:
US $ 500

A participant is expected to be ICCA member (see page 264).

"Amateur": programmers who have no commercial interest in their program,
and are not professional game programmers. Applicants for amateur
classification must supply information to justify their claim.

"Semi-professional": Any program submitted by an employee or associate
from a games-programming company. The program's name must not be derived
from or similar to a commercial product.

"Professional": A program whose name is the same as or derived from a
commercial product.


Any entry received after July 1 will be subject to a penalty fee,
doubling the above fees.
