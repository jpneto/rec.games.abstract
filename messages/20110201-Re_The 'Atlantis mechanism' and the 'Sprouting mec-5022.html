Most inventors would agree. Some might even be inclined to follow the
German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss' motto "pauca sed matura" -
few, but ripe.

Personally I like the risk. Chess variants are especially risky, but I
know 'Atlantis behaviour' inside out and all tools were available. The
only requirement, given the recycling mechanism as a new component,
was to select the right combination.
I came close enough to the mark to notice that I was slightly off.
When the game stretched a bit long, the pieces seemed increasingly
forced into roundabout ways towards the target, making the kings
relatively stronger.
It's a matter of taste, but once a reasonable number of tiles has
disappeared, I prefer the occasional blitz attack to succeed. If kings
become relatively safer, games might too often turn into a long and,
in my opinion, tiring hunt.

So I chose to use the 'tile taking' tool instead of 'piece only'
movement. I've seen it do an excellent job to the very same effect in
Caïssa.

My motto?
"Cogito ergo erro" - I think therefore I err ;-)
