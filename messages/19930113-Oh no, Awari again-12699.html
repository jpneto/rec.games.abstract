Yesterday a friend taught me Awari, and later that evening, in an
amazing bit of synchronicity someone else had posted an HP 48
version of the game which I have now been playing.

Unfortunately I did not follow the previous discussion of the
game in this newsgroup, but have now become quite interested in
its strategy and in finding out official rules (the two versions
I have been exposed to differ).  I would appreciate any pointers
to information on this game available by anonymous FTP, since it
appears my local news server has now expired any articles
discussing the game.
