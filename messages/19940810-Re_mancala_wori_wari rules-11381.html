Nice description of Wari by Edward Jackman.   Couple of comments though...

Edward Jackman <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:ejackman@delphi.com">&lt;ejackman@delphi.com&gt;</a> writes:

|&gt; If it is your turn and all your opponents holes are empty,
|&gt; you must play into them if you can. But if you can't the
|&gt; game is over and you get all the stones left on the board.
|&gt; 
|&gt; If you capture all your opponents remaining stones,
|&gt; leaving him or her nothing to play, the game is over, and
|&gt; you get all the remaining stones.

I wonder if this is quite what you meant?  All the previous descriptions I've
read agree with paragraph 1, but not quite with paragraph 2.  That is, the
usual rule is: that ANY move that leaves no stones on the opponent's side of
the board is illegal, UNLESS no other moves are available, in which case you
make your empty-side-leaving move and win all the remaining stones. 


The second query is one for which I've seen various alternatives...

|&gt; If you capture more than half of all the stones, you win.
|&gt; If neither of you can capture more than half and the other
|&gt; stones are just going round and round with no progress, it
|&gt; is a draw -- whether you both have the same number of captured
|&gt; stones or not.

One variation I've played is that any stones left traversing the board
endlessly are split between the players, (which may involve half-stones), and
then count up as before.  This leads to fewer draws, which IMHO is a good thing.

Another variation I've read of (also with fewer draws) was from Murray's
"Board Games of the World" which gave the remnant stones to whichever player
most often had them on his side during the circulation.

e.g.     - - - - 1 -    with South to play; the stones circulate until they
         1 - - 1 - -    come back to this position again. Almost all the time
                        there are 2 on the south side and one on north.  So
South would get two and North one, before the final count.

This last version seems "fairest" to me, but is more difficult to program
a referee-program for, and more difficult to word an accurate rule elegantly.
So I suggest the former variation is better for actual play; but either is
better than Edward Jackman's variant, because of drawn-game numbers.

|&gt;And if anybody wants to play any version at all by email, just
|&gt;send me your chosen rules and the board position after your first move.

Will do!  Can't wait for a game.   Cheers.
