n reference ot my previous post "Analysis for Mediocrity" I thought it
might be useful if I posted the Rules for Mediocrity aswell, since
it's an interesting game and may not be widely known (although it has
been discussed here before). So:

Rules for Mediocrity: a game for 3 players.

At level 0:
There are three offsets: 0, 1/3, 2/3. Each player is assigned an offset.
These are used to break ties.
Each player picks a number in the range 1-5 inclusive.
The player with the middlemost number wins and scores points equal to
the number she guessed, plus her offset. The other players score just
their offsets.
This process is repeated W times. W defines the Width of a game of Mediocrity.
The scores for the W games are added, and the player with middlemost total
score is the winner of a level 1 game of Mediocrity. The offsets are rotated
(as the players see fit - eg everyone changes their offset, or the players
with 0 and 2/3 offsets can swap etc.) and points for level 1 are scored as at
level 0, with the winner scoring their winning score plus their offset for
level 1, and the other players scoring just their offsets for that level.

In general, W level N games of Mediocrity comprise a single level N+1 game.
Games at ever higher levels can be constructed using the above instructions,
with offsets rotating at every level. A single level N game takes W^N level 0
games to complete, so for levels above 2 it is wise to keep W small probably
no more than 2 or at most 3. Strategy at level 0 (at the coal face so to speak)
for winning at level 3 or higher is quite confusing to think about. The offsets
can be crucial!
