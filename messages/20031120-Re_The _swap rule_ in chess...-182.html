================repost starts============

I'd be interested in hearing some discussion on what type of an impact "the
swap rule" would have in chess.

To those who are not aware of what the "swap rule" is, let me explain.

Many board games offer a big advantage to the player going first.  I've
become
a big fan of both hex and Twixt, two abstract strategy connection-type
games.
(Both of these games can be played at a turn-based site called Little Golem,
by the way.)

In both of these games, the first player playing at or near the center of
the
board already has a very large advantage, at least among good players.  To
remedy this, both games are almost always played with the swap rule, also
called the pie rule.

It's called the pie rule since it's similar to the problem of how to divide
that last section of pie.  For example, if two children both want a slice of
pie, the idea is to let one child cut it into two pieces and then let the
other child choose which piece they want.  Obviously, it is in the best
interest of the child cutting the pie to divide the pie as equally as he/she
can.

In both hex and Twixt, the first player makes a move, and then the second
player has the choice of swapping colors, effectively stealing the first
player's move.  This, of course, deters the first player from playing too
strong of an opening move.  Whether or not the second player swaps, players
then alternate moves and there is no more swapping for the rest of the game.

This is also known as "one-move equalization" and it's an excellent way of
nullifying what might be too strong of an advantage for the first player.
It
can be used in many two-player abstract strategy games.

Three-move equalization is similar, but as you might imagine, it involves
the
first player making not one move but three.  He makes one move as White, one
as Black, and then one more as White.  And again, now the second player has
the choice of either playing Black and continuing the game from this point,
or
as White, and allowing his opponent to choose his own second move as Black.


So, back to chess.  I don't recall what the current win-loss-draw rate is
among masters (White wins 30% of the time, Black 20% with 50% of the games
being drawn?) but whatever it is, I do know that White enjoys a healthy and
modest advantage, right from the start.  In fact, we've all played over
games
where White won and Black never even quite equalized!  Why is this?  Why in
the world do we even allow this?  If it's so darn better to be White, if we
all cringe at playing a tournament game against a stronger player with the
Black pieces, if the win-loss-draw ratio is so much poorer for Black, why
not
adopt the swap rule in chess?  Let both players start on equal footing from
the get-go!

It's my contention that if this were done, Black's win rate will go up
(slightly) and Black's draw rate will also go up (slightly).  White's win
and
draw rate would thus go down by an equal margin.  Thus, the total percentage
of draws will probably remain the same.  Of course I may be wrong... it's
also
possible that Black's draw percentage will increase, but not as much as his
win percentage, giving us slightly more draws.

I can already hear the cries, "More draws??  My God, that's the LAST thing
we
need!"

Very true, but this wouldn't be the fault of the swap rule.  The swap rule
would have done its job and it would have done it well... it cut our "pie"
into two nearly equal slices.  More draws would be the "fault" of our
beloved
game itself.

If the swap rule were implemented, what would a fair opening move be,
knowing
that Black  now has the option to swap it?  Certainly not 1.e4 or 1.d4.
1.Nc3?  1.b4?  1.a3?  What would you play tomorrow, as White, if the tourney
you entered adopted the swap rule?

1.a3 doesn't seem right... since Black would then almost certainly decline
to
swap and take the initiative himself with 1...e5!

I'd be interested in reading your comments...

P.S.  This entire post was brought about from a single sentence I read in an
online article a moment ago, regarding Kasparov's game tomorrow:

   "Man and machine will face off one in the
   final match on Tuesday.  Kasparov will be
   confident after Sunday's victory, but will
   have the disadvantage of playing black."

"The disadvantage of playing black..."  Sigh... it shouldn't be that way, at
least not if there's a solution.


P.S.S.  Sorry for the long post.  I know the length of it alone will deter
many from reading it!
