Ha ha ha 

It is easy to play the deaf or the idiot for someone who is both deaf and idiot.
You surely know what I`m talking about.
People will soon understand who you are. People are not dumb.
You are a crappy-cheater-copypaster game designer.

Nestor is not plagiarizing at all.
He maybe had created crappy games but not copycats.
Anyone who take his time analyzing your games will soon discover the big scam.
What is the challenge of drawless game when you choose a board with odd number of squares (hexes or etc....)?
Luis is a good designer very good one.
Do you know why?
Because he is not deaf.
Because he is not an idiot.
Because he is always unsatisfied and try to do better.
Because he is deeply honest toward himself first and toward others.

Markrappy you are crappy-cheater-copypaster designer.

All you games will finish in a garbage as soon as people discover your scam..
You are Madoff-like in the world of game designers.
Your games worth nothing! not even a try.

Now GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD BBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEE
