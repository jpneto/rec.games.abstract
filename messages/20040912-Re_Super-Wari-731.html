Have you tried another main variation of Mancala where the rules are
slightly different in regards to how seeds are captured?

Here's a link to the rules:

Are there any people around who are fans of this particular mancala
game who can tell me more about it?

I have played a lot of mancala games - I particularly like Wari (aka
Oware, Awale etc.), Omweso and Bao. I have met quite a few people who
play these games, including some very strong players, and they seem
like really interesting games to play.

I have seen before the rules to the mancala game mentioned by Michael
but I have never met any enthusiasts of this game. Is there anyone out
there who likes playing it who could tell me more about the
tactics/strategy, history etc?

Thanks,

Paul
