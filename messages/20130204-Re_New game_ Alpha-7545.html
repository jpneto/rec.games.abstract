With CF pie, Black must assess the likelihood of a draw, and select a sufficiently advantageous initial move to precisely offset the disadvantage of having a draw converted to a loss.  Assuming such moves even exist, then, as with regular pie, it shouldn't really matter if CF pie is invoked or not..  One player will have the advantage of a good starting move balanced by the disadvantage of having a potential draw converted to a loss.

No. Christian's rule means that the second player always wins ties, no matter if he swaps or not, which in turn means that there's nothing the first player can do to have an equal chance of winning. Let's say the game has a 1% draw rate, which should be "sufficiently low" for your standards, and consider what will happen after various different first moves by the first player:

a) If his move gives Black a 50% winning chance, the second player will choose to play as Black for a 51% winning chance.

b) If his move gives Black a 49% winning chance, the second player will choose to play as White for a 51% winning chance.

c) If his move gives Black a 49.5% winning chance, the second player will choose to play as White for a 50.5% winning chance.

Etc.

No, it's not. While the goal is similar to that of Produto, I think you know that small rule changes can result in completely different games, which is much more than it can be said about Atoll when compared to Eight-Sided Hex or Grand Hex when compared to Hex.
