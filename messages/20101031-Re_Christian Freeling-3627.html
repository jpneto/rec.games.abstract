Right on schedule, Corey.  This just in from the Symple rule sheet:

"Note: In the first version of the game the 'group penalty' was set at
2 rather than 4, which leads to the possibility of..."

The slippery Christian tried to sneak this update into the rule sheet
when he <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>thought<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> nobody was looking.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>knew<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it wouldn't be long
before the tweaking began, though I didn't know it would be this
quick.  I get tired of being right all the time.

Christian promised to make an appearance here <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> posting to the
all important bgg, but I couldn't wait.  This is the Nagasaki of
Symple:

"There's one exception to the above. If, and only if, neither player
has grown yet, then black on his turn may use both the above options
in the above order: he may place a stone, therewith creating a new
group, and he may grow any or all of his other (!) groups."

Bye bye aesthetics - what was left after the calculator requirement
Hiroshima, that is.
