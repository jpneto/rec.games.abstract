You'd be missing an interesting feature of backgammon, the gammon,
so that if you are winning too strongly you don't want to double.

Well, I was putting this out here as an addition to other strategy
games.  How would you add the gammon to the mix?

It would depend on the individual game.  In general, it would require
identifying one or more additional conditions, above and beyond the
standard winning conditions, and award additional points for winning
while these additional conditions also hold.  Ideally, achieving such
a win would be neither too easy nor too difficult, either of which
would make it less interesting.

Would the idea of putting winning the entire series at stake on the
game be something worth doing?  Players once in a multigame match can
call a "Do or Die" and either get opponent to drop, or to play
through, and the player calling "Do or Die" has to win.  If player
manages to fold at this, the player wins the match.  This could end up
being called after players have doubled or redoubled.  You could limit
this to a player who is not too far behind their opponent?  If a
player calls "Do or Die" and happens to tie, then they lose the
multigame match.

Would this add a bit more brinksmanship to a multigame match?  Is this
closer to a Gammon?
