I just think that the folks who wrote Zillions are the likely
best implementers of the games rules that it runs, because they are fully
conversant with the capabilities of the engine.

I'm not sure about this.  I think that some third parties, like Peter Aronson,
Karl Scherer, Jens Markmann, and others, have done an awful lot of ZRF
scripting and game-playing and have implemented some wickedly complex games
brilliantly, things that far exceed the games Zillions ships with or even what
the developers thought possible, in all likelihood.  I'm also not sure that
they way in which you script a game, communicating to Zillions what moves are
and are not legal, has a large effect on the AI.  A legal move is a legal move
regardless of how it was generated.  I think that the strength of the AI has
more to do with how it evaluates material in relation to legal moves and the
game's winning conditions.
