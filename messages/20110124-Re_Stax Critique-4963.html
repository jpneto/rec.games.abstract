RGA is destroyed?  The same RGA that has resulted in the

It's actually sad, lol  It's funny because it's Bill Taylor, but it's sad
because my earlier prophesy has proven uncannily accurate.

  Bill Taylor: "Rec.games.abstract is destroyed."
  Rec.games.abstract: "Bill Taylor is destroyed."

I practically forgot about Bill Taylor with the contest going on, all the
new games, including my own Monkey Queen.  I'm surprised Bill Taylor rofl
even has the nerve to show his face rofl around here now rofl still claiming
rec.games.abstract is destroyed rofl  This is the first time in the history
of rec.games.abstract that it's functioning in its intended capacity. 
Before it was Bill and Harald's Excellent Adventure.  We had guest speaker
Richard Hutnik popping in with ultra crappy Chess ideas from the Andromeda
Galaxy.  We had Bill Taylor rofl bragging that his game Free Willy rofl or
some such rofl was the simplest game in the world rofl.  We had the
occasional Nim variant.  Just about the only relevant thing
rec.games.abstract had was me announcing my new abstract games, which were
actively ignored.

It's an exciting time in rec.games.abstract.  Christian Freeling was the
first reputable designer to venture into the barnyard and help clean it up.
He was soon followed by more renowned designers and new, budding designers.
New contest, new games.

But here we still have pathetic, moping Bill Taylor, mumbling over and over
again, "rec.games abstract is destroyed,  rec.games.abstract is destroyed,
...."

Bill's latest destruction announcement marks day 84 of his tizzy.  That's
why it's sad.  Holy shit get over it man!

Bill, you're right.  I destroyed the group.  I don't even know what that
means but I admit it.  I concede.

Now what, Bill?  Do we now hear you endlessly repeat the revelation over and
over until the day you die?  Aren't you worried you're boring your imaginary
audience?  Oh that's right.  Imaginary audiences don't get bored.  But real
ones do.
