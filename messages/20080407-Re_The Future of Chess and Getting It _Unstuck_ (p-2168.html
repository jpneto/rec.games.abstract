Where is the community of players who want to play Magic: The Chess?

My impression of Chess variants is that like artificial languages:
there are vastly more people who want to make them than actually learn
them or use them. Those who do want the rug perpetually pulled out
from under them are also not very likely to take it seriously enough
to compete in it. Do they really need a legal protocol?

Are you even in this group yourself?
