 line, where appropriate]

Twixt is a game that was released as a board game by Avalon Hill in the 60s.
You start with a board of some reasonably large size, the larger the board,
the longer the game, that is a square grid of holes, try 20 x 20 for a good
game.
Below is a diagram of a 10 x 10 board.  The two players are RED and BLACK.

Each player must create a boundary that connects the opposing sides of the
board of his color.

Play alternates.  There are two types of pieces, pegs and connectors.  On
your move, you place one peg (holes are marked '+').  Then, as a second part
of your move, you may place connectors between any of your pieces that are
a knight's move (from chess) away from each other.  Thus, the selection of
R's above would all be connected in a position indicating a win for red.

You can easily play this on graph paper and it's worth playing around with
a little to see how interesting it is.


I will collect rules posted for games, and make them available via
anonymous ftp.  Colin, how about posting rules for Othello/Reversi?
