Christian Freeling now claims that Hex would be more balanced with the Symple mechanism than with pie.

Symple Hex, in the words of CF's mouthpiece, Zickzack:

"Standard board for Hex, and the goal is to connect the two opposing edges of your color, just as in Hex.

On a move, a player may either 1. place a new group (i.e. a stone) of his color on the board or 2. grow any or all existing groups of his color by one stone. White plays first. Once and only once during the game, Black may grow all existing groups and place a new group, but only if White has not grown any groups so far.

Board size is up to you, try 11x11 or bigger."

Marvin Spellbinder made the following case, which stopped Christian dead in his tracks: 

"Observation: 11x11 Symple-Hex would certainly succumb to turn order advantage. Therefore pie trumps the Symple mechanism."

Thanks, Marvin.  The obvious had eluded me, and apparently Christian too, before you happened along.  Christian was running his mouth a mile a minute before you said that.  Now it's just chirping crickets.
