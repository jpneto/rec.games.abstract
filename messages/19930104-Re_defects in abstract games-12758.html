  If you want a game without defects, try Hex.  For those
who don't know, Hex is played on a rhombus of hexagons (or,
for go players, the veritices of a triangular lattice).  One
player plays black stones, the other white.  Black tries to
connect the top and bottom edges of the board with a solid
line of black stones, and white tries to do the same from left
to right.  The game has no draws, no complicated rules, and
is difficult.  The biggest drawback is that the first move 
is a significant edge.

We are faced with the very real possibility that "digital" and 
"manual" will be used as antonyms.
