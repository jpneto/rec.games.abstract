2 ideas:

1) Break the hexagons by the middle of the edges instead of by the 
vertex.

2) Allow any possible orientation but forbid that 2 adjacent hexagons 
share the same orientation. That could make some cells unplayable during 
the game (which is arguably worst than the draws we are trying to avoid).
One possible solution could be to paint in three colors the cells of the
board and to assign every color to a given orientation.  That's equivalent 
to play hex in another board topology. In fact this is equivalent to play 
Pex (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/pex.html">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/pex.html</a>) with a nicer board.

The colored board would just add a degree of complication, imo.  I'd just draw a line in each cell.  But if this would just be a morph of Pex, for me it would fail on originality.

My idea for salvaging the game would be to have each piece be a third of a hexagon, cutting from the center to each of three vertices.  Then there'd be six ways to place a piece in a cell.  I don't know if this would work.  It's just a thought.
