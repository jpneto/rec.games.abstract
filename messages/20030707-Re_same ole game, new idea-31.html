*I have never come across your phase of "perfect information" until
now, and after taking the treat into my mouth, my thoughts turned
sweet, "I don't know what feels better winning with perfect
information or winning with imperfect information."

In a world of imperfect information, I see your point of view for
liking games with perfect information. But, I think games with perfect
information played by two equal players are really no games at all, no
games as we know it anyway, winners and losers, etc. The games amount
to a draw or not worth playing because of its known outcome. Think
something like tic-tak-toe multiplied a thousand times or so.

But there is so much more to a world, and game, with imperfect
information.

Wonders unhand, my lad, wonders unhand : )

Wetware shortcoming? Hmm! 



I detest many removing cybernetics from game theory and focusing on
the thought processes of the player. I don't want to start arguing on
the meaning of perfect information;' I studied enough of cybernetics
to occupy a room or two. My, lad, the outcome of the game, for that
matter any game, is not a matter of wetware' but of information. Now
that may be a surprise to many that think they have something in
themselves that is inherently special, some special quality, some
special thought process, some special, well you get my point. And that
special something' is the reason why
: they won a game, they got the promotion, they are a Doctor, they
All rubbish!


The most important thing is not knowing what special immeasurable
quality is in a person but knowing all the information that has every
been sent to that person and all the information that that person is
sending. Personally I seen enough, and I mean enough, of the world to
know that the only difference among people is not a matter of
wetware' but a matter of information, and from that precious little 
information you get your winners and losers.'


I going off at all sorts of tangents, so see if you can follow. 
The degree of information that a player needs to make a decision
varies for its specific function, e.g., the function: mating, a school
boy or school girl choosing a partner needs only the information of
phenotype and maybe social position of desirable partner; function:
security, a married women choosing to cheat on her husband or not only
needs the information that she loves her husband, doesn't want to hurt
him, and maybe she might get beat up; function: "just surviving," in a
game where a player has much to risk the player only needs to know the
outcome of the game to decide  its not worth playing, I will lose,
hell, might even die.'


Now all the examples above are simple and doesn't go into higher
degrees of game theory and cybernetic that involve, corruption of
information and, to use your phase, imperfect information, etc.


I guess what I'm trying to say is that the winner and loser of games,
including the games that have perfect information' are not a matter
of something inner but of something outer, COMMUNICATION. There are no
games like you describe, i.e. that's outcome is depend on the
wetware.' Get real dude! Pick up a copy of, "a dummies guide to
cybernetics, and read it; you'll thank me for it : )


I read the article you recommended, ok not all but I scanned it. Chess
is not a game of wetware it is a game of information. Information of
knowing future or possible future outcomes; Information of knowing all
that has been input into an individual and knowing all of an
individuals outputs. My lad, I do understand your examples of
imperfect information, a card not turned over, someone not giving a
fuck about you to tell you a little information that could save your
ass, save your future, save your love for someone more accepting, and
some towering walls not peeped over yet, etc, and why they are
detestable, but, and I say but, my lad, the few games that are around
that reveal the very nature of the life we life in, must not be thrown
away and hidden, must not be used to promote wetware,' and must not
be separated from cybernetics. There are no games worth playing
without a little imperfect information. And the games, life games
included, that are becoming absolute (perfect information) are played
by people with corrupted information to only humilate, control, and
further their exhausting and feasting ways. I detest that more than
even cheaters. At least with a cheater, you can cheat back : )
With certain players and their corrupted information, you can only
hope...



Xong, your game is very interesting, Nate. You thought about combining
my game and your game together. For one thing, see I love information,
I love how people cling to it, even through the outcome of the little
information they used to make decisions may never be known in there
puny life times.  With my simple idea of reproduction in characters, a
gamer's world will not be finite; every choice that the gamer decides
will have an outcome on the course of play, and, hence, every outcome
that happens to a player, a world, a population, will rest with
information, imperfect information, or corrupted information.


"It's this simple, 38748 93837 36371, if you didn't know, then someone
controls your life or doesn't give a flying duck about your life." You
are starting to go in circles.


Nate, don't worry about the tone of this post; it has nothing to do
with you; it's just the way I write : )

 I hope I didn't go to far off tangent.
