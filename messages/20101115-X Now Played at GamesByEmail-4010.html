X is now played, for the first time anywhere, at GamesByEmail.

GamesByEmail:

X is a three player connection game:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/X_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/X_rules.pdf</a>

Very cool concept, though I'm playing it literally for the first time now. 
Never so much as play tested it.

Normally I wouldn't release a three player game because of the obvious
problem of collusion, which X is as vulnerable to as any other three player
game.  But I direly needed a connection game for a plain rhombus - no
colored edges.  Something had to give and it was the normally unwaivering
two player restriction.  A huge concession, but one made gladly.

See you there, Christian?  Corey?  I've got a challenge open and still need
two.
