Phalanx is played on an 8x8 board in which each square is further divided by
a diagonal into two isosceles triangles.  There are 16 2x2 blocks of squares
which each have their four diagonals meeting at a single corner. (I think
that specifies the board...)

The pieces are tiles (cardboard, in my set) the cover one, two or three of
these isosceles triangles. They move in any orthogonal or diagonal
direction, only over vacant cells, and they cannot rest except in a position
where their isosceles triangle(s) are aligned with the ones on the board.
They never rotate.

When two of your pieces are edge-adjacent to a single enemy piece, the enemy
piece is said to be "phalanxed," and is captured.  A move consists either of
moving a piece as described above, and removing any phalanxed pieces, OR,
not moving, but removing any enemy pieces that were left phalanxed by a
previous move (if the opponent made such a move into phalanx).

The object is to reduce the opponent to one piece. I'm skeptical as to
whether it's generally possible to do this -- it seems to me when both sides
are down to a few pieces they could chase each other around forever, but
maybe not. The rules do give an assignment of "point values" to the various
pieces, which are meant to decide "tied or drawn games," and this increases
my feeling that there should be some kind of rule like "a game is drawn
after so many moves without a capture." It may also need some other tweaks,
but there are some unusual ideas in Phalanx.

I've never played it. My set is by Whitman, 1964.
