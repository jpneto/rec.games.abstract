I believe, Chris Huntoon is becoming my favorite game inventor. Gorgon,
his new game (invented May 2001) is fantastic. Last night I played it for
hours!

Thank you.  Much appreciated. :-)

You find most (?) of the rules at

I am not quite sure, but I think that jumping is compulsory and that you
must jump the biggest number possible.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually jumping is not compulsory.  I playtested it with and without
compulsory captures and found that leaving the choice to jump or not up to the
player  made for a richer game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The game appears to be influenced by "Altdeutsche Dame" (i.e. Old German
Checkers): the starting position, the movement of pieces and the
direction of jumping is the same in both games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In games of material capture, like Chess and Checkers, stalemating an opponent
is never the main strategic objective.  It is far often more of a threat than a
reality.  What I wanted to do was create a game where stalemating an opponent
was the entire point.

I determined that the game would require two things:  petrification of pieces
(and by extension, jumping) and a limited, non-retreating movement.  So it was
essentially a Checkers-like game.  Rather than reinvent the wheel, I decided to
go back and look at the various Checkers variants to see if any had any
elements that would complement the game.

The problem with most European Checkers is that they are played on a single
color of the Checkerboard.  If that happened with a game like Gorgon, the game
would be over too quickly.  In Old German Checkers I found where pieces were
played on both the light and dark squares while allowing for interaction
between the two.  So it suited my needs perfectly.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
However, the new rules
(jumped over pieces are petrified; no "real" promotion, but pieces reenter
the board at the opposite side (top &lt;--&gt; bottom only)) make this a very
deep and interesting strategy game.

Theoretically a draw is possible, but I am sure this will never
happen in a real game.

Chris has a tremendous creativity, which results in some of the best games
I ever played.

His other great invention is Tourney:

Well I've invented a lot more games then just these two.  But I've always been
of the belief that a designer is a poor judge of his own creations.  So I'm
glad you like my two most recent games.

If Chris is reading this, could you tell us a little bit more about
yourself?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not sure exactly what you'd like to know.  But I'd be happy to answer any
questions you might have.
