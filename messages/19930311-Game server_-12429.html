Does anybody know if there are any game servers available on the Internet,
for games such as Othello, Checkers, and others?  I know there's a chess
server available, and possibly one for Go.

If not (as I suspect), does anybody out there have the skills and
resources to put one together?  It would be great to have a site available
at which we could congregate and play a variety of different strategic
games such as those discussed in this group.  

I know at one point there was a MUD running which had a number of
board games available in one room.  As I recall, somebody posted details
to rec.games.go.  I've since lost the telnet address.  Does anybody
know where it is?  If so, please post and we can perhaps start using
it regularly for games.  I know it had Othello, Go, and at least a 
dozen or so other games which you could play.  Perhaps we could set
up tournaments there -- even multi-game tournaments!  This all depends
on finding the address, if it still exists.  Anybody?

Colin
