Here are the current rules for the "Lego strategy game" I alluded to
in an earlier post.  Thanks to the few people who have commented on
earlier versions of the game, it has evolved to a more interesting and
slightly cleaner level.  Please try it and send me comments.  I've
never played with more than two players, so I would be very interested
to learn how well that works.

One thing that would greatly improve the instructions is illustrations.
But I tried to be very clear with English descriptions.

I havent really pursued the marketing idea, since the game is still
changing and there is a precarious structure problem.

Let me know if the name "Blox" is already used.

Blox is a strategy game played with building blocks such as those
manufactured by Lego(TM) and Tyco(TM).  Players compete to construct a
3D chain of blocks on a base plate.  Very simple rules lead to a
surprisingly complex game.  The game is still evolving, so I encourage
you to try variations.

Goal of the Game
------------------

The goal of the game is to be the first player to build a chain of
blocks that connect all four edges of the board.  All players could
make a chain, so the first one to do so wins.


Players
-------

The game requires two or more players, ages about 8 and above.  Good
spacial and strategic abilities will help.


Materials
---------

The game is played on a base plate of reasonable size - this is called
the "board" from now on.  A 10"x10" board is 32 dots square, and this
is plenty big, perhaps too big.  A smaller board is reasonable too,
and the game may be more complex because of the tight quarters.  You
can play for a couple hours on a board 16 dots square.  The board need
not be square and there is no particular orientation for it, other
than "dot side up".

You will need several dozen 2x4 building blocks.  There should be as
many colors as there are players, and no color should be the same as
the board's.  How many you need depends partly on the skill levels of
the players (skilled players will need more) and partly on how large
the board is.  For an interesting game, you will need about three or
four dozen for each player.

To support precarious structures, it will help to have some additional
blocks of various small sizes in a neutral color.  White, black or
clear blocks are good for this purpose.


Definitions
-----------

Two blocks are "connected" when the top of one block is joined with
the bottom of another by at least one "dot".  (The "bumps" or
"studs" on the board and blocks are called "dots".)  Simply putting
the blocks next to each other is not sufficient; they must be
connected.  Connections must be at right angles only.

A block on the board itself is said to be at "level one" or at the
"board level".  A block on top of a level one block is at "level two",
etc.

In a "chain" of connected blocks, you can trace a path from every
block to all other blocks in the chain.  Once two blocks are
connected, they remain connected even if they are later covered by
other blocks and can no longer be seen.  If there is a question at the
end of the game whether the chain is complete, then the obscuring blocks
can be removed.


Play of the game
----------------

Players take turns connecting blocks to the board or to previously
played blocks.  Only one block is played each turn.  You are allowed
to put blocks anywhere on the board, or on the top or bottom of other
blocks, either your own or opponents' blocks.  A special rule (to
avoid stalemate and infinite towers) is that no single block can
completely cover the top or bottom of an opponent's block, although
two or more blocks may do so.

Blocks may overlap the edge of the board either at the board level or
above, but you may not add blocks below the board level.

You cannot move any other blocks in order to place your block (except
see below).  This means you cannot connect a block below a level two
block because there is not enough room to insert it.  Beyond the edge
of the board, you must pretend that the board extends indefinitely so
that you can still not connect to the bottom of a level two block.
More generally, there must be a space of at least two blocks below or
two blocks above the part of the block you wish to connect to.  You
also have to be able to get the block into the space without moving
other blocks, so an otherwise possible space could be completely
surrounded by blocks making it impossible to insert the block.

The prohibition against moving played pieces also means that you
cannot connect one block to both the top of one block and the bottom
of another block.  (But see variations.)

Although you are prohibited from moving blocks already played in order
to play your own, there are times when this happens accidently, or
when you anticipate that it will happen.  In this event, you must
simply rebuild the same structure before playing, or in general, if
you can get the block in position ready to connect it, then you are
allowed to rebuild the structure with the block connected.  This is
where the support blocks come in handy - place them under blocks in
places that no player can move anyway.

You will probably need to reorient the board or even pick it up to see
hidden blocks around corners.  As a courtesy, try to replace the board
as it was before your turn.


End of Game
-----------

The game ends when one player completes a chain connecting all four
edges of the board.  The shape of the winning chain of connected
blocks is arbitrary; for example it may be an X, or a open or closed
loop.  But there must be at least one block in the winning chain
connected to each edge of the board by at least one dot.  The corner
dots of the board are on the two adjoining edges.

If no players can complete a chain, the game is declared a draw.


Strategy
--------

You can start in the center and work your way toward the edges, or
start from the edges and connect toward the center.  It is better to
allow more options for places to connect to since it is easier to block
than to connect.

You can block an opponents connection by connecting your block in the
same place your opponent would (but recall that you are not allowed to
completely cover an opponents block with one of your own).  However,
you can also block by playing in such a way that there is not enough
space for an opponent's block to be inserted.

Be careful not to lose the ability to connect to the last remaining
dots on an edge or it will be impossible for you to win.

The winning move will most likely have to be a double combination that
permits you to connect even if your opponent blocks one of the
possible connections.  The standard set up for a double combination is
to put two blocks close enough to each other and at the same level
(above level two) to connect either the top or bottom.  (If you are
allowed to connect to both the top of one block and the bottom of
another, this provides more possible double combinations.) If a double
combination is anticipated, it can often be blocked before being set
up, so you must plan further in advance.


Comparison with Twixt
---------------------

Twixt(TM) is a strategy game in which two players each try to
construct a bridge from one side of a gridded board to the other, one
player between N and S sides, and the other between E and W sides.
There are pegs that fit in the grid holes and bridges of fixed lengths
that fit between pegs and block construction of a cross bridge going
the other way, so only one player can accomplish the goal.  The Blox
medium imposes some different constraints; since they are inherently
3D, bridges are more complex.


Variations 
----------

Most variations make the game too easy to connect, or too easy to
block any possible win, so carefully balancing these contrary forces
is the key to an interesting game.

All blocks are assumed to be the same size, with 2x4 dots, but
different sizes could be allowed if each player has the same number of
each kind of piece.

Maybe adjacency could be allowed in a chain too, but it appears to
make it too easy to connect and too difficult to block.

Perhaps you can connect a block both to the top of one block and the
bottom of another if you can do so without moving either block; this
requires a horizontal gap of at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>two<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> dots between the two
blocks.  There are some cases where this could be allowed without
appearing to move the already played blocks, but there are some
ambiguous cases as well.  Or you could choose to allow any connections
even if it requires rebuilding - as long as all currently played
pieces end up in the same place.  Rebuilding could make for a longer
game, and it is error prone besides.

Maybe try allowing a block to be moved as a turn instead of playing a
new block.  This could be restricted to only those pieces that can be
removed without moving other pieces, or like the previous variation,
allow arbitrary rebuilding - as long as all pieces end up connected to
other pieces or the board.

Perhaps blocks should be connected by at least two bumps.  This would
avoid ambiguous angles when only one bump is connected, and result in
a more stable structure as well.

Perhaps each player could get an extra turn sometime during the game.

A somewhat smaller game can be played with the same rules except for
the initial conditions and the goal of the game.  For two players, try
starting with four pieces already played, two for each player, in the
middle of the board with a gap of 6 dots between them, like this:

                      --       

The goal here is to connect your two pieces.  Other starting configurations
could be tried.

Send me other variation ideas - especially those that fail.

Have fun.
