Clark, I was trying to attract a noteworthy designer to the group, but
now you've scared him off with your barnyard diplomacy, predictably.
Christian is not like you, someone with one interesting game.  Ralf
Gering has one interesting game.  A lot of designers have one
interesting game.

I'm starting another topic for Christian, since you've sabotaged this
one.  Can you please stay out of the new topic, at least until
Christian has had a chance to post there?

Hey chief you needn't worry about me, I'm just getting warmed up. You
on the other hand are still trying to promote Cage, a year old game
that was born out of a completely misguided idea that the jump is a
"cliche" capturing mechanism. Yeah the cliche is the jump being
arbitrarily chosen or being used as the basis for a game. And tell me
Mr. Ergonomics, who the fuck has a 64 piece checkers set? and what's
this crap about how I only have 1 interesting game? What is that,
according to the opinion of a jaded old man who pretty much calls
every new game anyone creates crap? I think I'll take the opinion of
the iggc and bgg communities over your lousy opinion any day of the
week and there have been people very enthusiastic about Canvas, Ki,
and the yet to be released Radiolarians. Fuck you buddy.
