I don't believe that.  Without the squares, it's just Hex on a Go
board.  Games between skilled, equally matched players will always end
in a draw with a number of stymies, not just one.  Even if the squares
are valued less and played later, it won't be a game of Nim.  Which
squares are played first depends on the surrounding positions of those
squares.  To call them valueless doesn't make sense.

I didn't suggest playing on the octagons alone -- obvioiusly that's the same
as playing on a square grid to begin with.
I was suggesting that in a game between rational players, evenly matched or
not, no one will ever play a square unless they are forced to and the
decision will always be trivial.


I've been unable to construct a situation that would be likely to happen in
an actual game in which playing on 488 they way you suggest versus using the
FCFC rule changes the winning path -- other than "w" versus "z" as above. To
be fair, I always play with the FCFC rule, so I'll concede that it's
possible -- maybe even un-rare between good players -- that the the rule
differences could effect the game, but I'd bet against it. I think it's more
likely like the situation in Go -- slight differences in scoring methods
that rarely change the outcome of a game, have a vanishingly tiny effect on
tactics, and no effect on strategy.


For example, X, who is trying to connect top to bottom, has just played in
the center octagon in these two board fragments:

  ---   ---   ---     ---   ---   ---
 /   \ /   \ /   \   /   \ /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |  o  | |  x  |  o  |  o  |
 \   / \   / \   /   \   / \   / \   /
  ---   ---   ---     --- x ---   ---
 /   \ /   \ /   \   /   \ /   \ /   \
|     |  x  |     | |     |  x  |     |
 \   / \   / \   /   \   / \   / \   /
  ---   ---   ---     --- x ---   ---
 /   \ /   \ /   \   /   \ /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |  o  | |  x  |  o  |  o  |
 \   / \   / \   /   \   / \   / \   /
  ---   ---   ---     ---   ---   ---

On the right, playing with the FCFC rule, X has completed the connection. On
the left, without the FCFC rule, they play on below ...


  ---   ---   --- 
 /   \ /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |  o  |
 \   / \   / \   /
  --- o ---   ---
 /   \ /   \ /   \
|  o1 |  x  |     |
 \   / \   / \   /
  --- x  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |  o  |
 \   / \   / \   /
  ---   ---   ---

O plays at O1, X takes one square, O the other, succeeding in breaking the
connection and making her own connection.


So it's theoretically possible -- but can this happen in an actual game? X
would have just played in the middle octagon on the left edge and been done
with it on the first move.


Can you find an example that illustrates your position?

The FCFC represents an aesthetic problem for me.  It makes the
connections dependent upon the order in which the squares are
claimed.  I don't like that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


I don't understand the objection.


  ---   --- 
 /   \ /   \
|  x  |  o  |
 \   / \   /
  --- x --- 
 /   \ /   \
|  o  |  x  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   --- 


Though X has the square because he played to both octagons first, players
don't have to remember who played where first. There are no 'dependent'
connections -- playing the second X MADE the connection, blocking future
connections.


But in the end, I think that the rule differences matter so little that we
could play the game EACH USING OUR OWN RULES!

So far, I've found games on 4+ valent grids much more difficult to fathom
than hex. You need a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more space to block. I'm not great at Hex and Y,
but I can always see what I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>should<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have done.
