TOROIDAL CONNECTION GAMES - THE "N.Z." CONVENTION
=================================================

I have posted similar articles before, but here goes.

People consider from time to time,
the matter of toroidal connection games.

If played on a locally orthogonal board,
the basic win criteria are:

If player "north-south" manages to make a loop going only
north to south, or equivalent thereof, e.g....

|      .  n n  .  .
|      .  .  n n  .
|      .  .  .  n  .
|      .  n n n  .
|      .  n  .  .  .             ...then ns wins; or

if player "east-west" manages to make a loop going only
east to west, or equivalent thereof, then ew wins.
.......

But without some sort of rule concerning who wins when neither
achieves this goal, which will be most of the time, probably,
too many games would end in draws.    e.g. here...

..  n  . e e e
e n n n  . e
e e  . n n  .
..  e e e n n
n  .  . e  . n
n n  . e  .  .

....neither player has a loop in either main direction,
though both have finished up with a "spiral" loop,
in this case NW-SE.

The "NZ" convention is a simple winning criterion awarding the
making of a nw-se loop as a win to "N", and a ne-sw loop to "Z".

So instead of players ns and se, we have players "N" and "Z".

This has advantages...

1) every game (assuming "cross-cuts" are sorted out) is win/loss;

2) there is, as usual, win/loss duality, i.e. stopping an opponent
   win can only be achieved by winning oneself;

3) N and Z diagrammatically reflect the win directions for
   the players;

4) they also represent standard Cartesian directions,
   Negative and poZitive (!), (and North and eaZt-weZt),

5) &amp; the country of origin (N.Z.) of the inventor of this mnemonic!

"""""

Sorting out cross-cuts, (or impasses),  e.g.     X O
can be done in one of several standard ways  O X
as in Quax, or Quadrex, or Crossway, or Swapway, all of which
I've tried, and recommend Quadrex or Crossway styles the best.

Quax: a diagonal bar may be placed between cells,
          it uses a whole turn, and they may not cross;

Quadrex: if three cells of an impasse are filled, the fourth
               automatically appears to avoid the impasse;

Crossway: if three cells of an impasse appear, the fourth
                 may never be played, and diagonal connections count;

Swapway: if an impasse appears, a player may use his turn
                 to swap positions of two members of it to resolve it.

""""""""

So, if anyone would like to try a game of Toroidal NZ Quadrex,
email me and we can start up a game!
