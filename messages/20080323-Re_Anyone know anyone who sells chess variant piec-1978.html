Hey, anyone have a lead on this? I would like to get pieces of the
Capablanca chess variety (Knight-Rook, Knight-Bishop), but my search
on the web has come up empty. Anyone have any possible leads here on
this?

Thanks...

Rich,

Capablanca pieces are used in Christian Freeling's chess variant
"Grand Chess," where they are called the Marshal and the Cardinal.  I
don't have a Grand Chess set myself, but I believe they are still sold
on Freeling's website.  The physical representation of the Capablanca
pieces is somewhat crude (horses with things growing out of their
heads), but Grand Chess as a chess variant is excellent --- the key is
the back row, which is empty except for the rooks, allowing for much
more freedom in setting up defense and attack.

Steve
