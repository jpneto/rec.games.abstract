Actually, my text has quite a bit of proof in it and my professors,
both calculus and linear algebra, teach proof during class, as well as
perform very difficult problems so we can see the techniques.  In
linear algebra we're required to prove things both in graded homework
and on tests.

But I'm frustrated because I don't like the rush.  I never have time
to consider what all this means, what he applications are, what the
implications are... it's rush off to the next problem set and memorize
the next problem solving technique.  I'm getting intellectual boredom
just from having to develop the next bunch of pointless techniques.
The more abstract classes are even worse.  I just can't imagine taking
3 months to learn analysis.  It seems ridiculously short.  People have
devoted their lifetimes to the study.  I'm not even going to scratch
the surface in 3 months.

I think a certain amount of that is inevitable in an
undergraduate course. It won't really sink in until you
are using it in a non-course context (which might include
simply a different course from the one where you learned it).
In full-time undergraduate study, there simply isn't much time
to be looking at any applications except your next course.

Perhaps you might enjoy reading on your own over the summer,
either a more advanced abstract text (such as Real Analysis,
perhaps the text by Rudin) or even some of the research
literature.

I have a few things I wish I could see before I'm too old to enjoy it:

1.  I wish I could see logic and math taught together ... throw in a
little set theory too... at the high school level, and carried through
at each step of the way.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This was tried while I was going through school. I was
drawing Venn diagrams in first grade. I think the experiment
by and large was regarded as a failure. For one thing, the
abstract stuff was emphasized and basic arithmetic was
dropped. That led to kids who can't take 10% of a bill in their
heads. And nobody can make change anymore.

2.  Give people the option to learn physics, analysis and calculus
together over a period of time much much longer than presently.  Call
it a combined masters program in applied math or something... give it
about 7 years.  Or maybe we need to admit that a 4 year program isn't
very workable in math?  Let's face it.. .it's a much harder subject
than almost any other.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's as workable as any other technical subject. Yes, somewhere
around 1 or 2 years out of school, it will all sink in. But that
doesn't mean your undergraduate training was wasted.

3.  Why should professors have to teach at breakneck speed and
practically not have time to answer questions in class?  Shouldn't a
math class take at least 2-3 hours to allow for discussion,
reflection, thought, etc?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The realities of scheduling. Graduate courses have the same
amount of contact time. But generally you have much more
out of class contact, both with other students and with faculty,
for mathematical discussions.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.  Professors who yell or belittle students in class or out of it
should simply not be allowed to teach.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Where do you attend school? This sounds like a deliberately
competitive program.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think I'm experiencing many of the downsides to the current system.
But I don't see a way out of it for me.. other than to accept the
reality and move on into the applied math world... ( numerical
analysis and engineering..).. and teach myself real math on my own
time in a more suitable environment for thinking.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you can stick with it AND learn numerical methods, algorithm
design, or some other applied area such as statistics or
operations research, you'll have the best of both worlds.
