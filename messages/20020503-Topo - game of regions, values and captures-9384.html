Hello,

There was an interesting abstract game called Topo in the book The Joy
of Mathematics by Theoni Pappas.

For those who want to try the game, I've typed out the rules from the
book:

Topo - a mathematical game

Topo is a game of many changing strategies. Any number of people can
play. When one is beginning to learn, start with only two players.
There are three parts to the game.

1. Building the regions of play
2. Assigning values on some or all regions
3. Capturing regions

1. Taking turns, each player draws a region adjacent in some way to a
previously drawn region. Ten such regions are drawn by each player.

2. Each player chooses a colored pen. Then, taking turns, each player
assigns a number value to a region until each player colored regions
total number value is 100. If a player wants to just assign a region
the number 100, then that player would have only one region.

3. Object of the game: The player ending with the most regions is the
winner. Note the number value of a region is irrelevant.

Moves: A region is captured when one or more adjacent regions
belonging to another player total more than that region.

Once a region is captured, it is out of play; and should be marked for
the capturing player.

Continue capturing until no more regions can be captured.

Topo has some intriguing variations. The more one plays the more one
discovers various strategies in building regions, assigning values and
capturing regions.
