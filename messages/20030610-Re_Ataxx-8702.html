I was "bitten" by the game ataxx recently and now am interested
in some strategy. To my mild surprise I couldn't find a web page
about it which told me anything other than the rules.

The game ends if and when no-one can move and the winner is the
person with more pieces.

And since I'm the Richard of "Richard's play by email server"


The strategy that I've found to work well is a 1 level min-max
tree.  you make a move that flips the most pieces (after your
opponent's best response)  If you go 2 or more levels... you get
better results, but it's not practical for a person (or at least...
not for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>this<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> person).

That said... others on pbmserv regularly kick my ass...

I really think there is something like opening and so.

And I had in my head some great opening and rules.
I�m not a 2 level thinker so I have to comeup with tricks and little rules 
to keep my self from losing every time.

I can think of 6 of those little rules and I don�t count thinking ahead as 
tactic. 

Really in the end game you need to have a strategic, because simply trying 
solve the game with only three spots open will you need to think ahead 20 
or more moves. Just because of jumping around.

What about make sure that you have always the situation where you have the 
last move. Where you with a jump can buy time and with a slicemove can end 
the game. So you can send the game at the moment you can win it, if you 
can�t win it just jump.Ofcourse you have to make sure you can allways make 
that jumpmove.
