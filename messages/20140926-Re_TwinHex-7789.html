That is NOT the revolutionary game I pointed to yesterday.

This kind of moves based on playing on the previous move (using numbered tokens and limited tokens) could be used in other games like go for example or any placement game.
You could use only 1 numbered token per turn instead of the 2 used in TwinHex.
You could generate 100 new games using this move protocol.
I have another protocol move little bit sophisticated ( It requires some knowledge in mathematics so it will be interetsing only for few people).
New boards will make some games looking new and will change even the original nature of those games.
New pieces or new protocol of building pieces during the game not by stacking which is used commonly. No! A creative way where a player could build his own pieces during the game following rules giving them some powers and so on.
New devices! That is my big expertise where no one could beat me.
I spend lot of time thinking to how to build devices to play abstract games.
Anyway one day I will publish everything about my discoveries included those unfinished hoping that someone will finish the job.
I`m still waiting for comments even negatives one.

Maybe one other BGG game designer will soon become a celebrity.
I will not give his name until he adds 2 or 3 games. 
People in BGG do not analyze what people are creating and how they proceed to create new games or to improve existing ones.
They are eager to destroy others rather than try to understand the potential of some game designers.
I hate the BGG game design`s ayatollahs (like Russ for example) who are trying to tell people how the game design has to be. 
Anyone is free to create even if he knows nothing about the game design.
Let the freedom prevail! Because no matter what the game designer produce or create the game ALWAYS belongs to the users.
