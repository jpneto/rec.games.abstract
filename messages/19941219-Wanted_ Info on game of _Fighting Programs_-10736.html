Hello,

  Quite a while ago, I recall haveing read something about a program that
simulates a computer. In that virtual computer's memory are two programs,
made in some sort of assembly. These two programs are executed simultanously.
  The object of the game is to write a program that, after both programs have
terminated, occupied the most memory, or has even wiped the other program
out of memory, or has modified the other program etc.

  Has a game like this ever been written? If so, where can I get it?
If not, does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of instructions should
be available to the programs? Any ideas on additional rules?

Any feedback is appreciated,
  Hein
