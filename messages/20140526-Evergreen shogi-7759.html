Hi all,

For those who like chess variants, here's a shogi variant I designed called Evergreen shogi.  All the pieces are named after animals likely to be found in pine forests.  I made a physical board for it; you can see the pic on my homepage:  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/home.htm">http://home.fuse.net/swmeyers/home.htm</a>

Evergreen Shogi

The game is played on a 6x8 board with the set-up shown below.  Note the asymmetry with respect to the owls and mooses.  The promotion zone is the last 2 rows.  All the normal shogi rules regarding pawn drops apply.  The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's owl.


r t o m t r
- s - - s -
c c c c c c
- - - - - -
- - - - - -
c c c c c c
- s - - s -
r t o m t r


o = owl (no promote)
m = moose (no promote)
s = squirrel (no promote)
c = chipmunk (promotes to hedgehog)
r = raccoon (promotes to bobcat)
t = turkey (promotes to fox)


Here are the piece movements:


1 1 1
1 o 1
1 1 1


1 1 1
# m #
1 1 1

1 s 1

* 1 *
1 r 1
1   1


1 * 1
  t
  1


* # *
# b #
# 1 #


# * #
1 f 1
1 # 1


1 1 1
  h
1   1


Here's the key to the piece movements:

1 means adjacent square

2 means one or two uninterrupted squares

* means jump to second square

# means unlimited unobstructed squares


As always, all feedback is welcome.
