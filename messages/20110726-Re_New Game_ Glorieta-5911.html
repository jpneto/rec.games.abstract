Looks good, yes. I'd say the moment to decline [to place a neutral
stone] doesn't run a symmetric trajectory.
Since you can't expect to complete a loop if you decline immediately,
you won't. In other words, being too early is lethal.

But being too late? Can you, really? The overall position will make
possible loops more and more likely for both players.
The first to decline implicitly subjects him/herself to the
restriction first. So in an even game, both get increased chances, and
both can afford to wait because whoever goes first gives his/her
opponent an equal chance, generally speaking.

This is most unusual and I'm very curious how it works out in actual
play.
