I agree with you!

There was a $1.5 million Chess championship in Mexico last year, and
no one cared.  The World Mind Sport Games will be going on, akin to
the Olympics, and no one in North America is picking it up.  If they
were, then players for Go and checkers could get money to go out
there, and sponsors.  But it isn't happening.  And the chess world and
others are waiting for a Bobby Fischer to bail them out.   This is of
concern for myself, in regards to IAGO and the IAGO World Tour.  If
the big games have issues, how do I end up having modern abstract
strategy games noticed.

Its a good question, and can be answered, at least by including a few 
factors not normal in board games - but let me defer that to say what 
doesn't work - or what is to be avoided. I think most chess burocratics 
openly [or secretly] whore after Olympiad status and money. Yet the willful 
association with sporting activities and their frequent drug culture is at 
least a double edged prospect - one gets exposure, but of the right kind.

I always thought the best publicity for chess was 'drug free'.

Why chess burocratics <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>want<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> to associate chess with drug testing seems to 
me to be completely inane. Anyway - you comments deserve more consideration 
than a few notes.

Can I limit myself here to saying that the presentation of the game means 
also accepting the nature of the media, and 'playing along' with that too.

More anon. Phil
