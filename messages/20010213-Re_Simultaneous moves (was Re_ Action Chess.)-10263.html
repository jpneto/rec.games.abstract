The general concept sounds interesting, but I have some objection to
the specific Hex variants you propose:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Just last week I was thinking of using "simultaneous" moves as a general
mechanism for removing first mover advantage, and possibly allowing many
pieces to move in parallel.  This can be done with pen &amp; paper, two boards
with a screen in between, or a program.  One can capture his own pieces.
If opposing pieces try to enter the same empty square, they annihilate each
other.  But if opposing pieces try to enter an occupied square, (only) the
original occupant survives.  The king becomes a moving target!  I think
the game would be a blast :-)

In the same vein, I thought of a series of Hex games (where first mover
normally has a "win") with different conflict resolution rules:
o Hex2 where neither player gets the spot and must avoid it for one move.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This could lead to repetition, if only one cell matters to
both sides (which could easily happen). Eventually the rest of the
board would fill up, and there would be no place else to play.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
o Hex3 where a third color (grey) belonging to neither player takes the
spot.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If neither side may use a grey token in their paths, then draws become
possible, which may or may not be a good thing.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
o Hex4 where a randomly drawn stone (grey, belonging to neither player, or
clear, belonging to both), is placed in the spot.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Random!!???!! Why not just play Parcheesi? :-) OK I may be over-
reacting, but clear stones could eliminate the tension and
interest of the game. Instead of a battle, the game could turn
into a footrace.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
o HexN where the players enter into a blind auction for the spot; winner
takes it but pays with stones; if a tie, re-bid or use Hex2 rule.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

"pays with stones" is a bit ambiguous; assuming you mean stones
already on the board, who decides which ones to remove? Are they
simply removed, or do they change color?

PS I don't see the ng rec.games.design, is it new? Should I update my
   newsgroups again? I did so just a couple weeks ago...
