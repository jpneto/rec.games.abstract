|&gt; 
(... deleted ...)
|&gt; &gt;
|&gt; &gt;	- The two players take turns placing their marks in the hexes.  
|&gt; &gt;	  The only 'special' thing here is that the first player may not 
|&gt; &gt;	  mark the center hex (i.e. the seventh hex in the seventh row)
|&gt; 
|&gt; Never heard this restriction.  There are various ways to make the game
|&gt; more balanced in view of the first player's large advantage.  The most
|&gt; elegant, to my thinking, is to have one player put some stones of either
|&gt; or both colors on the board and say whether it's White's turn or Black's
|&gt; turn to play, and then the other player choose which color to play.

I also don't know of this restriction. I played Hex some time ago very often and
I never saw an advantage for the first player in starting in the middle.
Yes, it's the best move to begin in my opinion, but there are also some
standard moves to defend this beginning. So I think that Hex is a very good
balanced game (surely on boards 9x9 and wider) and that there is no need of
restricting the first move.
