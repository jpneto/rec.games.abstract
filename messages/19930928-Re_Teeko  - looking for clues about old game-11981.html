|&gt; It's played on a 5x5 board.  The object is to get either four in a row
|&gt; (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a 2x2 square.  The players
|&gt; alternate placing one token on any empty square, and if (as is likely!)
|&gt; neither player wins on the fourth drop, subsequent turns consist of moving
|&gt; one token to any of the (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) adjacent
|&gt; cells.

It doesn't say here, but I presume you mean:- each player plays only his
own color tokens, and to win you need a row or square of your own color ?

|&gt; There are 16 openings, corresponding to the subsets of {1,2,3,4}, which
|&gt; describe determine whether your opponent chooses your nth drop position
|&gt; for you.        ....etc....

I'm afraid I didn't follow any of this section !  Doubtless my own fault,
but could you please describe this a bit more clearly ?

You didn't say anything about what "pointing" to a cell could mean, or what
the opponent playing one of your tokens could be.

Is it some kind of method for equalizing the chances and nullifying the
initial move advantage ?

If so, you may recall the rather simpler-seeming mechanism I posted a few
months ago, which can apply to virtually any board game, with excellent
effectiveness, I think.    I called it "three-move equalization".

|&gt; In practice, it sure seems to me as though this game is "clearly" a draw
|&gt; under rational play, and the only way to win is to capitalize on your
|&gt; opponent's blunder.  Agree/disagree?

I'd love to comment; but I must await your clarifications, Karl !
