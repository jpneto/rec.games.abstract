For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.

   Chess is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>static<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> game. By that, I mean that all pieces are always in
the same positions at the beginning of every game. There are only two
players, and play alternates between them. A certain amount of
intelligence is required to play; but sheer, raw ability to consider and
process a massive number of moves several turns in advance is most
necessary.
   I expect that within, probably, ten years (twenty at most), chess will
be "solved" by computers, meaning that it can be shown with certainly that
either white or black is guaranteed a win with proper play
(sequential-turn games usually favor the first player when "solved").

   But try a "dynamic" 18XX game (1830, 1856, 1870, or other 18XX in which
there is no fixed order in corporation-opening): There are no pieces on
the board at the beginning; players have only starting capital. There are
no random elements save initial player order (which is quickly rendered
moot during initial auctions and changeable turn order based on company
stock valuations).
