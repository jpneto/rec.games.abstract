Daniel Schultz discovered a flaw in Cage.  There were no legal moves
available in the following scenario: A ring of 8 stones around the
center, arranged red, blue, red, blue...

I relaxed the rule constraints a tad to allow for a legal move in that
situation.  See Figure 5.

Daniel played the Cage program about 50 times before this special
position occurred to him, so it wasn't real obvious.  I don't see how
any problems could exist in Cage now but that's how I felt about the
original version.  So, stay tuned I guess  lol

The new version allows a new type of move but it doesn't disallow any
old move types, so it's a superset of the old version.  There's a
larger tree and there should be a correspondingly richer gameplay.

Yeah it's a little embarrassing when flaws turn up, but at least a fan
discovered it and broke it to me gently.  I didn't have to learn about
it from the usual YIPPEE I PROVED MARK STEERE WRONG!! public
announcement.

Bottom line, an outstanding game just became a little more
outstanding.  I took the downloadable Cage program off my website for
now, but hopefully Thomas Plick will agree to incorporate the change
into his program.
