It's an interesting concept, this "equalizing" mechanism.  If you're ahead
in group size, you only get to place two stones instead of three.  I get it.
 I don't know if I like the general idea of having an equalizer, preventing
anyone from surging ahead, but maybe that doesn't happen.  Maybe you can
surge ahead in other ways, by having a superior formation for example.  At
any rate it's architecturally interesting.

Ketchup is essentially a draw susceptible game though, if both players end
up with the same largest group size.  Adding a horse shit rule (no offense,
Nick) of then comparing the next largest groups, and the next next largest
groups, etc. hammers a square peg into a round hole and it's an aesthetic
disaster IMO.

What Ketchup seems to have in common with Sygo is that it's only as good as
its latest tweak.  For example, there are a number of parameters in the
following paragraph that could get tweaked, once players become a little
more expert.

"When a group of at least size 2 has formed, the nature of the turns change.
 From then on, on your turn, if your largest group is smaller
than your opponent's largest group, you must drop 3 stones. Otherwise you
must drop 2 stones."

Or Nick could simply adopt Christian Freeling's approach and make the
players design their own game.
