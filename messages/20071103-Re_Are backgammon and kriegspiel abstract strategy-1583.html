I'd say that their handling them would be appropriate, but no one is

Can you please give your boundaries for what should or

I can give only an opinion; not a ruling.  The association should
set its own limits, and whether the limits are stated in the name of
the association is not important.  They may limit their scope to
boardgames, and I think that would be appropriate, but that doesn't
mean that it must be called "a group for abstract strategical
boardgames".

Should a key be there is a strategic linking of pieces in
games of the association that have an impact and
an overall strategy?  This would knock out cardgames.

I thing of cardgames as gambling games, if only potentially, and they
might not want to include them.  I wouldn't.
