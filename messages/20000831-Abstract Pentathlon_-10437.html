Hi all,

As you know, there are some "multisports" combining
2+ sports, like Modern Pentathlon.

If we wanted to define, say, a new Abstract Pentathlon
using abstract games as those individual sports, what
would be a nice set of games for it?

Some thougths:

* Most of them should be traditional and with a lot
of active players, in order to attract players for it.
* At least one (or even two) should be modern games,
say, at least 20, 30 years old. They should not be
as well studied as the traditional ones, giving some
space for non professional players of the other
traditional games
* They should be as much ortogonal to each other as
possible (i.e., no two games of the same "type")

Let's say, 3 traditional games and 2 modern ones.

Candidates?

I would guess Chess and Go and perhaps Renju for
the traditional ones.

For the modern ones, some choices could be:
* GIPF or Abalone
* Havannah or Hex
...

One of the modern games could even be chosen at random,
and the players would only know it at the tournament start.

more ideas, anyone?

Best Regards,

Joao Neto
