The descriptions of Twixt posted so far have all been incomplete.
A move consists of 3 parts -
 1. Place a peg in any free hole,
 2. Remove any of your own bridges,
 3. Place bridges between any two of your own pegs which are a knights
    move apart.
In parts 2 and 3 you may remove (add) any number of bridges.

Part 2 is the rule that is most often forgotten. Even in the rule books
accompanying some productions of the game it was incorrectly ommitted.
It is an important rule, since it often resolves otherwise drawn
positions. A good example is the mini situation already posted

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
      . . O .    If X is connecting right to      . . O .
      X ./. .    left, he can play at x,          X ./. .
      .\O X .    remove his leftmost bridge,      . O X .
      . X O\.    and make a winning connection.   x X O\.
      . ./. X                                     . ./. X
      . O . .                                     . O . .
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In fact, with the help of this bridge removal rule, drawn games are
extremely rare in Twixt.

Twixt was invented by Alex Randolph, a prolific inventor of games
(see Sid Sackson's "Gamut of Games"), who introduced it to a group
of artist freinds who used to frequent a Vienese cafe. It has been
produced by several manufacturers, all of whom are required to credit
the inventor (what a good practice).

Twixt is, quite rightly, very highly regarded, and is rated as one of
the best modern board games around.

If you think that the concept of non-intersecting knight moves is simple,
try programming Twixt. Or try to find a non-intersecting knight tour
of 17 moves on a 6x6 board (with no square visited twice). The unique
solution can be found in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Circus".

Alternatively, try the following little game. The first player marks a
square on an 8x8 board. The second player draws a line from this square
to one a knights move away. The first player then draws a line from this
square to another a knights move away and so on, each player extending a
knights tour, which must be non-intersecting, and no square may be
visited more than once. The last player able to move is the winner.
This is an entertaining little game, and one capable of being played
with a high degree of skill. I would be interested to hear of anyone
who manages to program this one.
