This is a game for, preferably, 3 or 4 players.

Start with an m-by-m grid drawn on paper. I suggest that m be at least
3 times the number of players.

Each player take turns writing numbers in the squares, each number
being small enough that other numbers may also be written in any
square if necessary.


In each player's first move, he/she writes a 1 in any empty square of
the grid.

Thereafter, a player places a 2 then a 3 then a 4, etc, each number in
a square. The number k must be in the square adjacent and horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal to the square (but not in the same square) where
the SAME player last wrote the number (k-1). Each number must either
be written in an empty square, or be written in a square such that the
new number is coprime (relatively prime) to all numbers previously
written in that square (by any player).

The first player whose path of numbers visits all of her/his
opponents' 1's and then lastly returns to her/his own 1 is the winner.

If a player cannot move, then he/she is out of the game.

A player may win if all other players forfeit by not being able to
move.

I assume you define 1 to be coprime to any other number.  Otherwise, the
game will make no sense.
