I analysed each game submitted, played at least 10 games for each game
submitted, and would like to submit my application for the stacking
games contest as an expert player and analyst in the field of new
gaming.  Despite my involvement in extensive testing towards monkey
queen, i have run the full gambit of support to it in certain fields
to open statements against it in other fields, and thus believe my
involvement with it will not influence my decision away from or
towards it, and that any comments i have made towards or away from one
game have not had further influence on my judgements towards a game  I
am highly critical and am frequently requested for reviews of one
thing or another as i can be trusted to give a truthful, and highly
technical judgement to a variety of fields..

However mark has issued a statement of protest to any member on the
judging panel opening discussion on a game's complience with the
rules, and thus if we go with this, i would not be elegable.  If we
don't, i would also like for clarification on what are the limits to
the criteria we use in judging a game.  Should game quality be the
only thing judged, or would relevance to the theme be in the
criteria.  If it is, how strong should it be.  I beleive these things
need to be answered prior to the judgement, that way the nature of the
contest is clear from the get go and we know if we are awarding: "best
game in the stacking game contest" or "best stacking game in the
stacking game contest" or anything inbetween.
