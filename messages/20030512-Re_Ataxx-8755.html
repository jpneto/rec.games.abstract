The rules? Oh, here they are: it's played on a 7x7 grid
and if you're going to play it "in real life" then you probably
want to use othello (i.e. reversible) pieces rather than go pieces
because there's a lot of flipping. The start of the game
looks like

B.....W
.......
.......
.......
.......
.......
W.....B

(let's call the players White and Black). Play alternates and when
the board is full play ends. A play consists of two parts: firstly
a player does a "move" and then some "flip"s. The move can be of
precisely one of two forms: a player can either do a "spawn",
which involves placing a new piece of his colour on a vacant
square which is adjacent (in the "kings move" sense i.e. diagonals are OK)
to a square already occupied by himself, or a "jump" which involves
picking up one of his pieces and moving it two squares away
(i.e. a place which can be reached by 2 kings moves but not by one).
That's the end of the "move". The player has then occupied a previously
unoccupied square and he then does the "flip", which involves
flipping over all the pieces of his opponent which are one move
from this previously-unoccupied square.

There was a shareware program around (I think by the game's inventor) which
had random (but symmetrical) blocked out squares that could not be played
on. That gave more variety from one game to the next.
