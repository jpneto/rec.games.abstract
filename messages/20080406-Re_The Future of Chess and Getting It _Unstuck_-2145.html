Interesting you should phrase it that way.

I don't see the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>en passant<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rule as a problem, but I do see it as the
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>solution<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to a problem. The perceived problem would be that giving a
Pawn a double-step first move should only have the effect of letting
it advance more quickly, but not the ability to bypass a threat of
capture presented by the opponent's Pawn structure.

Given the restriction on the King's move in Castling - it cannot cross
a square where it would be in check - however, it would also seem that
the "problem" wasn't really perceived in quite those terms at the time
the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>en passant<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rule was adopted. Instead, it was apparently just
felt that, in principle, a "special" move shouldn't allow bypassing a
possibility of capture, without detailed consideration of the impact
on the game in terms of such things as Pawn structures.

In general, what is percieved as a "problem" with a board game <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a
matter of taste. The rule in Checkers that capturing is compulsory can
be viewed as a problem. Why should one have to make a move that is
disadvantageous, doesn't that go directly against the point of a game
of strategy? That's one of the reasons some people go on to Chess, and
why a draw for the opening moves was considered an acceptable way of
dealing with stereotyped games in Checkers, while it would be unlikely
to be acceptable to the Chess community for their game.

If, in Go, one's tastes lead one to believe that playing out a
position shouldn't have an impact on a player's score, then one will
tend to prefer area scoring to territory scoring - except that one
might also want to retain the additional (perceived?) sharpness of
territory scoring, which is what has led to a number of systems being
proposed in addition to the traditional Chinese one.

I also remember, back in the 8-bit computer era, a computer checkers
game advertised which, for some bizarre reason, played Continental or
Polish draughts. Had it been advertised in a European magazine, that
wouldn't have been odd, but only natural, but this was advertised by
an American firm to American customers in an American magazine, and in
the English-speaking United States, that game is virtually unknown. If
you want equipment, you would have to draw your own 10 by 10 board on
a piece of cardboard - that sort of unknown.

Perhaps the company was reselling a game they licensed from a company
in Germany or somewhere. But the ad copy did say that this was the
"real" and "official" international form of Checkers, which it might
very well be.

There's even a Canadian checkers. I once saw a book, in the French
language, about the game in the library of my local University, so I
know it's not mythical, but it is peculiar to Quebec, the rest of
Canada being firmly in the English-speaking world of Checkers on the 8
by 8 board. This Quebecois Checkers is played on a 12 by 12 board, and
is played by the rules of Polish/Continental Checkers otherwise, IIRC.

The idea of a 12 by 12 board for Checkers though makes me think that
when the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Jeu Plaisant<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> was found unsatisfactory, and the transition
took place to the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Jeu Forcé<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, that is, when capturing became
compulsory, an alternate route to enrich the game might have been to
go to a bigger board. Perhaps on a 12 by 12 board, the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Jeu Plaisant<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
would no longer be inadequate, and even a draw for openings would not
be needed, making Checkers more appealing to those who now often go on
to Chess.
