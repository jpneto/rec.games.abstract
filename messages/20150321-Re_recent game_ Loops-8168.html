:P yes. That stipulation came about when I realized that a "draw" position wasn't technically impossible. The game could technically have a position with no loops. I'm almost positive that it couldn't form in actual gameplay, but if both players tried to form a loopless game, then they could. In such a situation neither player would want to place pieces and they would both pass (which is how the game originally ended), but of course they might pass with an even number of spaces occupied. 

Like I said players actually trying to win couldn't form the position, but the game not being technically drawless still obviously wasn't ideal. :P 

Louis made the suggestion that just making it impartial would solve the issue, and i had tested it like that previously, so i knew it would still be fun. It's very possible that it would actually be the "simplest" solution. Louis also pointed out that it might even make the game "better" by making life slightly harder.

Just forcing players to play to a full board w/o impartial moves could of course have players filling in their own loops. And of course that too could be solved by allowing loops to surround their own color. I was really close to just going with this, and who knows maybe I should have.

But when I thought of just defining "control" in that fashion and simply declaring an "end state", it struck me as somewhat elegant. It maintained the exact same game I had been playing without adding much clunkyness IMO. And ultimately the game just "feels" partial, so I like the way I can still say impartial play is just another option.

It seems able to provide some decently interesting contests, for sure, but I think my primary interest in this set of games is that they strike me as just about the simplest "territory games" possible. A "loop" as the requirement (for the "main game" as opposed to the variants) stood out to me, because a "loop" is an inherently territorial shape. Even with all the other requirements I mention there, players would still end up trying to form "loops" in an attempt to win.

I'm glad you enjoy the ideas as much as I do. Oust (hex version of course) is one of my 3 favorite games other than Go (along with Catchup and Havannah). Your work is a huge part of why I wanted to be a game inventor. Thank you.
