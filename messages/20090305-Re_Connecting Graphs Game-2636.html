Players take turns connecting any ADJACENT pair of dots/vertices with
a straight line-segment, one segment each move.

Whenever 2 distinct connected graphs are combined into 1 connected
graph by a line-segment, the player drawing that line-segment gets a
point.

No points are obtained for starting a new connected graph, for
extending a single connected graph (in a way that does not connect to
another connected graph), or for connecting a connected graph back to
itself.

The game is over as soon as there is exactly one connected graph

This game sounds familiar too. Where have I stolen the idea from?

Elements of this game occurs in Aquire, an abstract game that is
themed around hotel chains.

In Aquire, you put square tiles on a grid.  Each group of tiles (of at
least two) represents a hotel chain, and when two groups of tiles
connect, the chains are merged.  Scoring is through shares which are
affected by the size of a chain and which get bonus points when a
chain is merged.  You can't place tiles in arbitrary spaces -- each
tile has one place it can be put, and you draw a hand of random tiles.

So, while there is some similarity in the sense of merging groups of
nodes, there are also very large differences.

Aquire is, BTW, a very good game.
