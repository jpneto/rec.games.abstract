<div class="moz-text-flowed">For some years we had a game that could accommodate
<br>large groups surrounding a theme that we ran at some
<br>conventions.
<br>
<br>However it was not abstract in that a theme had to
<br>be applied to the game.&nbsp; Themes ranged from Fantasy
<br>to Science Fiction.
<br>
<br>We also learned that it worked regardless of game
<br>mechanics.&nbsp; Strangely enough we ended up calling
<br>them "Parallel(tm)" events.
<br>
<br>The original group is currently dispersed now and
<br>the leader now works for GAMA.org.&nbsp; We're hoping
<br>to make a comeback.

<br>Well maybe not on the order of thousands like Ultima,
<br>but how about a game that could accommodate 10 or 20
<br>and yet be purely abstract.&nbsp; At the moment, the most
<br>I can think of is 6-bowl Abalone.
