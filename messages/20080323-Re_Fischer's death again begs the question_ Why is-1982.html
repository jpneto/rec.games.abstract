So why does anyone bother entering?  Perhaps because they /like playing
Chess/?  people who like playing will often like watching, and will
appreciate quality play whether or not it ends in a draw.  A draw is an
outcome reflecting similarly good play on both sides: it is fair and is
not necessarily dull.

What is important to understand is that a tournament is a version of a
game, and it will get gamed by people to maximize their chances to
win, irregardless of what each game calls for.  If a scoring system
rewards draws more, there will be more draws.  It goes with the
territory.

Good points! In fact, if scores for draws are the same as averaged win/lose,
then there is no particular emphasis on avoiding draws, or playing for a win
<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>in terms of scoring<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> - and other factors become important; Andy Walker
mentioned ratings as one factor, and the other is one's position in any
tournament, or how feisty you feel.

To follow the language above - if the scoring system rewards draws with
black more than white, with 0.6 and 0.4 of a point respectively, will that
factor disrupt 2 things? (a) if players collude to draw they do not get the
same reward , and (b) will it produce less draws overall by stimulating the
white player to fight on, and not draw?

What can be done is possibly causing the reigning champion to lose his
title, and it remains unseated, if no one manages to pull through and
actually end in a tie.

Another possibility is to use speed chess as "Overtime", like the did
recently with Chess960 as a way to tie-break.  Don't like to go there,
well then win?

Beyond this, besides a system gamed to draw, the amount of play in
chess has resulted in there being far less ways to surprise anyone, so
the end game ends up being predictable, minus a bungle.  Each side
will play hard, but sound, making for a reduction in pieces to the
place where a draw is left, with current rules.

You could also simply have people not be able to ask their opponent
for a draw, and force them to play it out.  Maybe do an opposite
version where you can ask your opponent to resign or force them to
double the points the match is worth.

The last option is to add new rules to chess, to make the game new.
Of course, this is heresy to hardcore players of the game, who think
the FIDE rules were handed down by God and immutable for eternity.
