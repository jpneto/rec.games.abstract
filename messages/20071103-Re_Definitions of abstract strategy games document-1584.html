problem, because it is fair.  Caylus is a different animal completely
here as far as games go.  I think the nature of games part of IAGO
should involve the placing of pieces on a board that have a positional
impact on the game.  With Through the Desert that is so.  With Caylus,
it is not.  This needs to be a criterion.

I am not saying include Caylus because obviously it is themed too much.
However I don't see why abstract games should necessarily involve
placing pieces on a board with positional impact on the game.
Admittedly I can't think of many abstract games that do something
different - but I don't feel the need to close that avenue off prematurely.
Also I don't even see the need for a board (as suc) - would anyone argue
against Axiom being an abstract?  Although everything you do in Axiom
is for positional advantage the playing surface (the cubes) are moved
and even eliminated during play.

Where is long-term strategic ramifications if there aren't pieces on a
board whose configuration impacts long term planning?  Do the pieces
in how they are configured have an impact on play?  It looks like it
does, eventhough the play areqa is modifiable.  What I was saying
about "tiles" would extend to also the Axiom set up.

I was trying to contrast this to Caylus or cardgames.  Neither of
these have positional consideration for pieces.
