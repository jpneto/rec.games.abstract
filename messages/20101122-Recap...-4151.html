What a tumultuous couple of weeks!  Perhaps the most active
rec.games.abstract has ever been.  Virtually none of it was game discussion,
maintaining the status quo since before I ever got here... unless you count
Bill Taylor's self-congratulatory,  pseudo-intellectual twaddle as "game
discussion".  Self congratulations for the likes of Christmas Tree Y is
actually rather typical of Bill Taylor.

So, what just happened??  Might as well start at the beginning.  Not to put
too fine a point on it, but the beginning was Christian Freeling.  Freeling
was, for whatever reason, getting ready to wrap up his gargantuan thread in
the Arimaa forum, one which dwarfed the whole rest of the forum.  I remember
his comments on the "dog pack" in his parting remarks, and musing about a
new place to discuss games.

Naturally I saw a mutually beneficial opportunity, and so extended Freeling
an invitation to the public, unmoderated forum, rec.games.abstract.  It
benefited us, because we got an injection of talent - the precise moment the
fireworks fuse was lit.  Bill Taylor, who had been virtually absent for at
least a year, freaked when he saw renowned abstract game designer Christian
Freeling having the gall to make posts on rec.games.abstract.

Bill Taylor's tortured, jealous rationale: I ruined rec.games.abstract by
chasing him and Korneliussen out, so now he's going to exact revenge by
ruining rec.games.abstract for me.

Logical problem #1:  I didn't chase anyone out.  Sure, I screamed at people
on a number of occasions.  I was getting tired of drowning in snot issuing
from the noses of math enthusiasts who know shit squat about abstract games.
 But a year or more ago Bill Taylor embarrassed himself so badly that he had
to flee the group in shame.  I don't even remember the details.  Basically
he copied one of my connection games, mutilated it, and then accused me of
stealing my own game.  He was reinventing himself on my coattails and he got
busted.

Logical problem #2:  Bill Taylor hasn't ruined rec.games.abstract for me. 
He's provided entertainment by embarrassing himself so badly that he had to
flee the group in shame - again!

Bill Taylor's plan to bring down rec.games.abstract was at first a simple
one: Uninvite Freeling with trademark Taylor snotiness.  "You're not worthy"
- something Taylor now looks back on as constructive criticism, lol  The
word "ugly" seldom plays a role in constructive criticism.

The problem was not Taylor's insults.  It was his gibberish.

"Corners are ugly because they're a special case of not being sides..."

????????

"My Christmas Tree Y at last solves the long standing problem of Y not
having frilly decoration."

????????

Nobody even knew what the fuck Taylor was talking about.  And we still don't
because he refuses to answer any follow-up questions about his gibberish.

At first I thought Taylor's plan was succeeding, with Freeling running off
to join rgc rofl, but I should have known better.  It didn't take too much
Bill Taylor bullshit before Freeling came out swinging, with a flurry of
body blows, and a crushing knee to Taylor's groin.  Down for the count.

Phase 2: Taylor ups the ante.  He replaces deserter Korneliussen with new
recruit Corey Clark.  Clark is problematic because he's throwing Taylor
under the bus every ten minutes, but he'll have to do.  Together they devise
a plot to shut down rec.games.abstract.  Taylor with the bellowing spam, and
Clark with his new, fake newsgroup.  I couldn't even find that shit at
first, lol

Well, we all know how the fake newsgroup ended up.  SHUT DOWN!!!! lol  Clark
was actually moving discussions from here to his bullshit forum in the
pathetic belief that shit would take root there.  The biggest strike against
rgc rofl?  Its moderator, the self-described "belligerent and immature"
Corey Clark, lol  Lotsa luck attracting members with your personality,
douche bag!!

You're very well known everywhere you go, Clark, including the Arimaa forum
and bgg, as a big pain in the ass!!  Now you think people actually want to
be moderated by you?? lol  How fucking delusional can you be??

The fucking boob has already deleted a big portion of the posts there.  Oh
yeah, let me waste my time composing a post for rec.fucking.boob only to
have it deleted by a fucking boob!!!! rofl

Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, and back in rec.games.abstract...
