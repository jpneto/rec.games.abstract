New MSG Game: Trivor



<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Trivor_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Trivor_rules.pdf</a>



Trivor was inspired by Abouricha Hazen's connection game, Half-Stone.  Or more precisely, my misinterpretation of his game.  The tessellation in Half-Stone is similar to a honeycomb pattern except that the cells are each divided into a left half and a right half.  I had assumed that the cells could be divided in any one of three orientations since there are no vertical lines demarcating the left and right cell halves.  But Abouricha continues to draw the tokens in left and right cell halves only, even after this apparent restriction has been mentioned to him, so one can infer that this orientation is mandatory.  Half-Stone does not have variable orientation cell division after all.



If Half-Stone did have variable orientation cell division, I wouldn't release Trivor.  I don't believe in running off with other designers' games by making minor modifications to them and renaming them.  Trivor isn't a minor modification of Half-Stone though.  The two games actually have very little in common.  Half-Stone's tessellation belongs to a class of innumerable tessellations whose cells are a fraction of a rotationally symmetric shape.  The vertical cell division lines are invisible in Half-Stone but they exist nonetheless.  Trivor's tessellation, in contrast, uses fully symmetric cells.  No fixed division lines.  Trivor is also the only game I'm aware of which has trivalent, variable orientation cell division.



Half-Stone and Trivor have diverged even further now that Abouricha has added the "sandwich" mechanism from Dieter Stein's Verto to address the cross cutting issue.  



Half-Stone is a work in progress since Abouricha, apparently taking a cue from Christian Freeling, is making major modifications to it on a weekly basis.  Now he has promised to yet further modify Half-Stone in order to address "a big flaw in my game" (again, ala Christian Freeling).



My thanks to Abouricha though for inspiring Trivor, however unintentionally, and to Carlos Luna Mota and Luis Bolanos Mures for the ensuing discussion of variable orientation cell division, even though only I have discovered a robust solution.
