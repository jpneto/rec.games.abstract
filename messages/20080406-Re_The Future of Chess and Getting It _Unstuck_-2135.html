I happen to like Fischer Random Chess (I don't like to call it
"Chess960", because I think Bobby Fischer deserves credit for
his invention) but it is not chess, and thus there is no need
to "integrate it into the chess community."

I've checked into this a bit more, and I see that indeed Chess960
isn't the original Shuffle Chess, but is instead indeed an alternate
name for Fischer's precise version.

I agree that anyone who invents something should be given credit, but
given some of R. J. Fischer's unfortunate actions and statements
during the latter part of his career, I'm afraid that anything with
his name on it will be anathema to many people. Such as, to give one
example, Kosovars, and to give another example, New Yorkers.

Castling elsewhere than to the edge of the board seems pointless, so I
would be inclined to recommend either constraining Shuffle Chess only
to the extent of keeping the Bishops on opposite colors, or shuffling
only the middle six pieces... leading to Chess 108.
