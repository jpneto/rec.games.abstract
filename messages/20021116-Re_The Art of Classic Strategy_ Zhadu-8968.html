I can vouch that Zhadu is a good game (web sites are a matter of taste), at
the old web side there use to be PDF files with rules, play but mail
notation and advanced strategy guide, I hope this content gets put back up
sometime.

Here is a general description of play: the board has 8 triangles in a
diamond shaped, each triangle has 4 movement spots (the 3 corners and the
middle). Movement is point to point. There are 5 pieces per side a 1,2,3,4
and a 123 each of which is a different size, or otherwise marked in the 123
case,  which indicates it value and movement (3 is worth 3 and must move 3,
123 is worth 1,2 or 3 and can move 1,2 or 3). This is a game of capture -
but the interesting part is the winning captures must add up to 4 (i.e.
capture the 1 &amp; 3 , or just the 4, or the 123 &amp; the 1 or 2 or 3.....) so
what get captured changes what you do with the other pieces - the 4 is weak
and must be protected until something else is captured. the 123 is the
strongest piece but also the most valuable to capture.

The game is made of nice wood, but I don't want say if the game is worth X$.
I will say I found this to be one of the best abstracts publish in 2001.
