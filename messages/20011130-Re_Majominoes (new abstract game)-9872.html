That sounded like a good idea to me at first glance.  But then I figured
that what would probably happen is that each player would always take two
moves (except for X's first move, where it's prohibited).  This means that X
would end up with the extra cell on the board.  So not only would X go first
but she'd always get the extra cell.

With such a rule, O would postpone her double move until her last
move, thus ensuring herself the extra cell.

Yes, that's exactly right.  There was a thread here (I think it was here) a
few years ago about Trax being the perfect game because (under perfect play)
it was not a win for either player, and had no draw.  The only remaining
possibility I could see was that the game never ended.

I believe 5-in-a-row (gomuku, renji, ...) on an unbounded board has a
similar property - games can go on for very long and it may well be
that it will be infinite with perfect play on both sides. Since it is
never a disadvantage to have an extra mark, the only possibilities are
forced first-player win and infinite play (which can be classified as
a kind of draw).

On a 5x5 board, the search space is small enough that a computer can play
perfectly, but I doubt this would be the case on a 9x9 board or bigger. 7x7

My motivation was to find a new pencil-and-paper game that I could play with
an 11 year old.  The rules had to be simple but I wanted to have some depth

For that, it would probably be fine. The aforementioned 5-in-a-row is
fine for that also.

It's poosible that this game doesn't have any obvious strategy until close
to the end game.  Similar, in that regard, to Hexbo (do you know that game),
which looks like a really clever but which, to me anyway, the first
gazillion moves seem like they may as well be made at random (which may just
mean I'm too stupid to understand the game).

I don't know that game, but I have seen games like that (with no
obvious strategy until the endgame).

It might make a nice little puzzle applet, where a 5x5 board is presented,
and you know you have a win, but you have to find it.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True. You could let the applet do exhaustive search but start second
(without the double-move rule), so the player can always win with
perfect play.

An alternative to the double-move rule is a rule whereby the second
player can choose to swap sides at some point during the game. This,
obviously, shouldn't be near the end of the game when the outcome is
obvious. Also, he might be required to declare the switch one turn
before it is made, so the first player can make one more move before
the switch happens.

This still doesn't change the fact that the game is a preordained
certain win for one of the players (assuming perfect play), but it
makes it harder to find the perfect strategy.
