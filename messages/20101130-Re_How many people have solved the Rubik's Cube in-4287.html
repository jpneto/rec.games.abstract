Hello!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
By now and worldwide, many people can manage to solve the famous 3x3x3
Rubik's Cube. However, most of them learned to do so either from
friends, books, or the Internet. Personally, I feel it is very
difficult to figure it out by oneself. So I am wondering what
percentage of the people who can solve it now actually worked it out
independently, i.e.,  without external help of any sort. If you don't
have the statistics, can you make just a wild guess?

Thank you for reading!

The only way I've discovered to solve one of those infernal things is
to disassemble it (which isn't that hard to do) and reassemble in the
proper order.

Some people peel the little colored squares and stick them on other
blocks, but that can't be done very many times, as the stickum 
deteriorates. ;-)

Cheers!
