I have some doubts about the "usually". The object is to leave
yourself without a move. If you have one group, this condition is
obviously met, but the reverse is not true. Here's where the 'approach
condition' comes in. The LOA object of creating one group doesn't work
here, so you can't leave the 'rounding up' to the players. Hence the
condition that not only enforces it, but fits in perfectly with the
misere object.
And I can envision lots of positions where the winning player has more
than one unit.

As in many games, controlling the center is quite important. From
there, it's easier to cut enemy units off, thus forcing the opponent
to spend much more turns connecting them.

If indeed at all.

Same here, you implicitly envision a player winning while having
several units.

P.S. It's no criticism, just trying to get an idea of how the game
works out.
