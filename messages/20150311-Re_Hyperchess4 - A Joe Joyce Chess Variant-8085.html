I see your point, Hazen, that extra dimensions arbitrarily and unnecessarily add complexity to, in this case, an already complex game, Chess.  And in general I'm pretty much in agreement with you. Another drawback is the explosion in board size.  Even with the tiny basis of length 4, 4^^4=256.  That's huge.  A 5D board, if perfectly symmetric, would have 1024 cells.  It'd take a month to play.  

What I find interesting in Hyperchess4 is mainly the board.  I find its geometry and connectivity appealing on some level.  I was wondering what a honeycomb 4D board would be like, and if a Hex-like connection could be played on it.  Probably not.  Connection games really need to be 2D.  Otherwise enemy paths can go around one another.

You and Joe got off to a rough start, but you're both good guys and I'm sure you'll patch things up.  I'm glad you decided to stay and I hope Joe hangs around to. 

People like to blame me for fucking up rga by chasing people out, but I never chased anyone out who didn't deserve it.  Some people can't take the heat.  When everything goes tits up, they need a moderator to cry to.  Then the big, tough moderator boots everyone out who isn't saying "mother may I." In my case, I don't need that.

I contributed more than anyone.  I announced more new games here than any other designer, with the possible exception of you Hazen.  If not, I'm sure you'll overtake me soon.  

The truth of the matter is that the old members don't have shit to talk about now.  Luis designed one game in 2014 - a Corey Clark Slither variant.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.   Nick Bentley re-released the ancient Produto with Bill Taylor in 2013.  No wonder Nick has a chip on his shoulder.  He and Taylor are undoubtedly crying on each other's shoulders about how I fucked up their lives.  The only thing that fucked them up is that I'm a better designer.  Then Nick released a word/party game in 2014 called Stinker. I think that pretty much speaks for itself. Bunch of crybabies.  

Christian Freeling, who just turned 95, is the only one left of the old crew who's still active, releasing a new abstract in 2015.  More power to him.  He was the first of the major abstract game designers, and he may be the last.
