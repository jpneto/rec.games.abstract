Crossway is played with a Go set.

Like Bill Taylor's recently announced Quadrex, Crossway is a
connection game in which draws cannot occur.

Bill, when I started reading your announcement of Quadrex earlier
tonight, I nearly had a panic attack.  As I read a little further into
it though, I was relieved to see that the two games are not nearly as
similar as I first suspected.  Still, it just doesn't get any more
coincidental than this.

Crossway is much more fluid than Quadrex.  In Crossway, connections
can be formed in eight directions, more than the six directions of
Hex, and much more than the four directions of Quadrex.  I haven't had
a lot of time to think about Quadrex, much less play it, but my
initial impression is that Quadrex is more tactical than strategic.
I'm guessing that at some number of moves into the game, strategy is
overwhelmed by rampant, unpredictable chain reactions.  (Sorry if
that's inaccurate.  It's just my initial impression.)  Crossway does
not rely on any type of chain reaction mechanism to preclude draws.
Crossway is pure strategy and much more similar to Hex than Quadrex
is.
