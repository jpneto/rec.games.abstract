Ugh.  Is there any way to edit these posts after they're up?  Too many
typos/grammos.  Apologies.

Yes, it's called 'supersede'. It doesn't guarantee that the original 
will be replaced, that's at the whim of the individual server admins, 
and may even fail to propagate. I've seen it work for my own posts 
though. Note - you'll need to use a proper interface to usenet in 
order to use it. Google groups sucks in this regard, much to everyone's
chagrin.
