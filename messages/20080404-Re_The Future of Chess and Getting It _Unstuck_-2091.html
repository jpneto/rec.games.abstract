Liar.  Either produce evidence that my opinions about chess are
based on religious beliefs or shut your trap.  I will not stand
by while you repeat the above lie again and again, always refusing
to back up your words with evidence.

He may be making an untrue statement, but he is not making <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
untrue statement.

His remark does not mean "you consider changing the rules of Chess to
be contrary to the essentials of Christian belief, hence heretical",
it means "you are among those chess players who have an intense
emotional reaction to the idea of changing the rules of Chess, based
on a rigid, irrational attachment to the rules as they are, such that
your view of changing the rules of Chess is akin to the reaction of
certain types of religious people to what they view as heresy".

Given what his statement actually means, and would be understood to
mean by the average reader, it may still be an unfair characterization
of your views in this matter. But by playing the confrontational game
with him, you're <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>providing<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> evidence that the latter statement might
be true.

Even though you would still be providing absolutely no evidence of an
objection to changes in the rules of chess that is of a theological
nature.
