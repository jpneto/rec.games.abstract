                (I am sorry for my bad English)
   If you want to think about something different then "Hex",
I am going to propose you to find the strategy for my own game for one
player mode for the arbitrary game field. (I call it "Web").
Is is the right news-group to do it?

   A) It is the rules for one player mode:
   The game field is the set of nodes connected with arcs.
All nodes have the blue or red color.(In the initial position all nodes
are blue). In the first node is the checker.
The player can move the checker to any connectedg node, then this
node will ALWAYS change its color (from blue to red, or from red to blue)
The restriction for one player mode: the move from node B to node A
is impossible if the previous move was from node A to node B.
   The task of game is to set all nodes in the red color.
   (Mail me if you want more examples or the MS-Windows program for this game)
  For example:
    &lt;1&gt;     &lt;2&gt;     &lt;3&gt;
   /   \   /   \   /   \
&lt;4&gt;     &lt;5&gt;     &lt;6&gt;     &lt;7&gt;
   \   /   \   /   \   /
    &lt;8&gt;     &lt;9&gt;     &lt;10&gt;
  Here the solution is 1-5-2-6-3-7-10-6-2-5-9-6-2-5-8-4.
  For the training:
&lt;1&gt;   &lt;2&gt;   &lt;3&gt;   &lt;4&gt;
 | \ /   \ /   \ / |   (Here node 1 is connected with node 6,
 | / \   / \   / \ |    but is not connected with node 2, etc.)
&lt;5&gt;   &lt;6&gt;   &lt;7&gt;   &lt;8&gt;
 | \ /   \ /   \ / |
 | / \   / \   / \ |
&lt;9&gt;   &lt;10&gt;  &lt;11&gt;  &lt;12&gt;
  Find the solution yourself.

   B) The rules for two players:
   Is is impossible to move two checkers in one node.
Each player has his own checker and his own set of nodes:
A-B-A-B
| | | |
B-A-B-A
| | | |
A-B-A-B
( A - the nodes of the player A,
  B - the nodes of the player B)
   Each player change colors of his nodes and
must set in the red color these nodes before other player set
his nodes in the red color.
