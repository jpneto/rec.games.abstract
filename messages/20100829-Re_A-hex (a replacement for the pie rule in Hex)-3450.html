I know.  You were trying to force me to play against you by
sleeplessly monitoring iggc for a period of days and instantly joining
every challenge I posted.  That's why you're a psychopath.

To be honest Mark, Hex Oust is quickly becoming my

I don't hate your guts.  I simply won't play you at any game, as I've
made abundantly clear for weeks.  I was already committed to never
playing you again before your recent stunt blocking me out of iggc.
Remember my post in this topic way back on August 13, 2010?  "[Corey

The readership thinks you're being facetious.  They don't understand
that you really are encouraged by what would normally be considered
discouraging remarks such as "fuck off".  Again, this is why you're a
psychopath.

I don't think so.  This discussion isn't even a dispute.  What's your
claim, that you have the right to play against me, and that if you
can't, nobody else can?  What a psychotic asshole!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Mark, one of the last things I am is a psychopath. A psychopath is
someone with no empathy who goes around manipulating people as if they
were commodities. I wouldn't have time to waste on the internet
playing Flume or Hex Oust or anything if I were a psychopath.  I
didn't sleeplessly monitor iggc anymore than I usually sleeplessly
monitor iggc! I'd much much much rather play a game with Septomor,
tuerda, gkvp, Arty or raza than you there but if you're on and you
open a Flume game and I think "hey I think I'd like to try that", I'm
going to join the room.

"ingratiating himself in the hopes that I'll grant him private
audience - something that won't happen again." Sorry Mark, I just
thought that was nuts is all :P


"The readership thinks you're being facetious." What readership?!!!!
Do you see a bunch of posts here from people besides you and me? You
see, nobody has said anything related to this argument since you
highjacked my thread earlier this month. I think the readership is
genuinely disinterested myself. Besides, I doubt this community puts
much stock in anything you say that has any sort of social context.

"What's your claim that you have the right to play against me" The
fact that you're using a site that allows you to play abstract games
with people all over the world, I certainly have a "claim" of a right
to play against anybody on that site.
