Yes, Christian, we got that the last five times you reminded everyone.  You
have made a valuable contribution to the contest as have Daniel, myself, and
others.  While your efforts are sincerely appreciated, Christian, you aren't
running the show any more than Daniel is running the show.

Oh for fuck's sake!  You're really starting to repeat yourself, Christian. 
Did my monkey glorification intrude on <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> massive self-glorification

You haven't agreed to shit!  You've been kicking and screaming every step of
the way, Christian.  You reluctantly went along with the decision to use
judges, while continuing to campaign endlessly for future, publicly voted
contests.

You only got objections and disclaimers rolling left

I objected to a public vote, which issue has been resolved, and I think my
only current objection is Alex being a judge.  How does this extrapolate
into rampant objections gone wild, climbing trees and laying waste to the
landscape?  What else am I objecting to here, Christian?  You should be able
to name something with all my "objections and disclaimers rolling left and
right".

lol, "wolves"?  You're willing to throw your game to your appreciative
audience, Christian.  You've made that point again, and again, and again,
and....  I can't wait for this contest to be over so I don't have to
continue being drubbed by the draconian repetition of Christian
Freeling......

lol, You're sure making a big fuss for someone who doesn't care!  Is the
readership to believe that my objection to Alex as a judge caused this major
Christian Freeling meltdown?

You gow up!  You're obviously in a snit because I was dubbed "the
architect".  It's only a nickname, Christian!
