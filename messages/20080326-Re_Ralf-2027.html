That was really strange.  Gering obviously hates you and your games

Ralf may resent my success as a designer, but he admires my skill.  He
once described me as one of the best game designers in the world,
believe it or not, in a message on the Yahoo abstractgames group.  The
message no longer exists since Ralf later pleaded with the owner to
remove it, but if you look at the messages there before me and Ralf
started arguing, you'll see that one message is missing.  That was the
message.

Ralf's undying quest in life is to create the illusion of
credibility.  But the more stories he tells, the more firmly he
establishes his implausibility.  Here Ralf is attempting to create a
reputation for himself by panning my games.  Trouble is, he doesn't
have any good games.  He has a grand total of two games, Kludgefest I
and Kludgefest II, programmed on one game site.  Nobody ever plays
them except Ralf and his sockpuppets.
