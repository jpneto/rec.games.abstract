It may not be the fault of the swap rule, but the percentage of draws in
master level games would almost certainly increase all the same, if one-

How about simply not allowing draws anymore?

Gee, this doesn't change the character of the game at all, does it?

Smell that? That's sarcasm.

Besides, there are other drawn situationds for which you'd need to come 
up with equally preposterous and game-changing ideas (perpetual check, 
stalemate, situations in which there is no forced mate but in which 
either side COULD win if the other made a mistake, etc.)

Do the people who are really GOOD at chess ever want to re-write the 
rulebook, or is it just people who suck?

(Incidentally, I suck, but do NOT think the rulebook needs to be 
re-written. However, I find "grandmaster draws" to be distasteful, and I 
personally wish that chess was not so dependent on knowing variations 
through move 20. But that's why people play chess variants.]
