|&gt; &gt;    The board: A MxN rectangle of dots.         
|&gt; &gt;    The play : Players alternate making moves, last one able to move wins
|&gt; &gt;    A move: A move in this game consists of drawing a straight line 
|&gt; &gt;       connecting two (previously untouched) dots. The line may not cross
|&gt; &gt;       any previously drawn line, nor can it pass thru one dot on the way
|&gt; &gt;       to another. Each dot can have at most one line touching it.
|&gt; ..
|&gt; &gt;  Anyway, has anyone ever heard of a game like this? Thoughts?
|&gt; 
|&gt; For boards with odd M and N this could be analyzed as a Nim-like game
|&gt; as described in Winning Ways by Conway.

Of course it could be (and should be). There isn't going to be an enormously
simple characterisation of the winning positions, because the subspace of
games played on 1xn rectangles is the octal game .07 (is this "Dawson's
Kayles"? I haven't got Winning Ways with me) in which a move takes exactly
two counters (points) from a pile (set of contiguous lattice points) and
then divides the pile into 2 piles, either or both of which may be empty.
This has Nim values that repeat with a period of 34 for n &gt; 52 (the exceptional
n being 0, 1, 15, 17, 18, 32, 35, 52). In particular the winning positions for
the second player are n=0,1,15,35,34m+5,34m+9,34m+21,34m+25,34m+29 (m&gt;=0).
