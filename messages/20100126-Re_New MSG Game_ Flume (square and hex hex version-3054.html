Square Flume is an extremely simple game.  In fact it's hard to
believe a game emerges from one simple rule, but one does - a game
uncannily similar to Dots and Boxes.  Hex hex Flume is a tad more
complicated with two restrictions on stone placement.

Square Flume reminded me of a pencil-and-paper word game that I've
played.  If you reduce the alphabet to a single letter, "stone", and
put just one word in your dictionary, "stone stone stone stone", then
the word game is a lot like Square Flume.

But the reduced word game's "one simple rule" for taking another turn
is different.  You'd need to replace "play adjacent to at least three
stones" with "play the fourth corner, completing a unit square of
stones".  Of course, you'd need to replace the opening array of green
stones.

So I'm curious if you experimented with that the "finish the square"
rule instead of the "finish the T" rule as you created Square Flume,
and how it turned out.  I've never been sure how much of the word
game's strategy is dominated by letter choice and how much is
dominated by letter placement.
