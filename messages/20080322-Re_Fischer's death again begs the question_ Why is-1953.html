That's exactly what you're doing.  Imagining.  Chess evolved to its
current incarnation a long time ago, and it won't be evolving further
any time soon.  Chess doesn't reflect anybody's wishes.

It's not hard to create a version of Chess without so many draws at
the top level.  You could use a 10x10 board for example and add a few
more pieces.  The game tree would be much more complex, perfect play
would be much more difficult to approximate, and the draw rate would
be dramatically reduced. Nobody's "clamoring" for that though.  Chess
variants don't have even a tiny fraction of the player base that Chess
has and they never will.

You don't have to look too hard to find "average" Chess players
bemoaning the high draw rate among experts.  And nobody is going to
argue that a repeat position draw or a 50 move rule draw is a dramatic
ending.  But that's what you're stuck with.  You either play it as is
and deal with the problems or you move on to a robust, but much less
commonly played game.
