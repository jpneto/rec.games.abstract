A couple of weeks ago I posted a review of D.B. Pritchard's
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Encyclopedia of Chess Variants<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  I have just one added bit of
information:  postage costs, which will be added for orders
received after 1 Mar 95, are UK�2.50 to the UK, UK�3.20 elsewhere
(Europe airmail, rest of world sea mail).  So if you plan to get
a copy, don't delay.  If you don't recall why your life would be
incomplete, nay, barren, without a copy, I hereby repeat my
earlier posting:

I belong to NOST, a postal (and now email) gaming club that is
primarily chess, but which has offered chess variants and non-
chess games from the start some 30 years ago.  The NOSTmaster is
trying to get more CV players in, in part because of worries
about computers and postal play.  Email me if you'd like further
information.

In the latest issue I did a review of the greatest reference ever
for chess variants, far surpassing the excellent 10th issue of
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>World Game Review<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, which covered 677 variants in generally
rather less detail.  I quote:

David Pritchard's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Encyclopedia of Chess Variants<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (Godalming,
Surrey:  Games &amp; Puzzles Publications), ISBN 0-9524142-0-1, is
finally out, and worth the wait!  This is, to my knowledge, the
biggest CV publishing event of all time, in any language.  384
pages in 6�"x9�" format, 540 diagrams, 350 game scores, about
1450 variants including notes on about 160 proprietary games. 
Pritchard produced the book himself but the production values
(layout, paper quality) are up to the standards of the big
companies (well, aside from proofreading).  Everyone interested
in CVs should order a copy now.  The price is UK�21.99, DM 63, or
US$41, postpaid anywhere up to 1 March 1995.  That's if you pay
with a US bank check; if you pay by credit card he doesn't have
to pay exorbitant bank fees, and the price will be closer to $36. 
Just send credit card number and expiration date as usual to
Games &amp; Puzzles Publications, PO Box 20, Godalming, Surrey GU8
4YP, United Kingdom.  Do it now.  (Incidentally, G&amp;P Pubs. is not
directly connected to the newly revived <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Games &amp; Puzzles<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.)
     The book contains virtually every CV ever played in NOST as
well as the thousand-plus that haven't been.  (Well, not all the
combined games like Doublemove Dynamo Shatranj, but almost
everything else.)  I haven't been able to think of a significant
game, aside from the most recent innovations, that isn't in the
book.
     To give you an idea of the thoroughness of this book:  the
'four-handed chess' section is almost 7 pages long, covering 26
variants, two of them (Verney's and Hughes-Hughes's) in detail,
including discussions of openings and endings; there are cross
references to three of the four-handed commercial games, and
individual sections on nine other four-handed CVs follow.  (Also
over 3 pages on three-handed variants.)  The 'hexagonal chess'
section is 5 pages, 6 variants (those of Gli ski and Brusky
discussed in some detail), with cross-references to 6 more.  The
'three-dimensional chess' section is 4 pages, discussing 16
variants, with cross-references to 8 more, and yet another 3
immediately following in their own sections.  Among the other
major sections are those on kriegspiel (4 pages), progressive
chesses (8 pages), shogi (10 pages), and XiangQi (9� pages). 
There are 1� pages on Avalanche, with six sample games; almost 2
on Dynamo, with 3 sample games, and 2 of Doublemove Dynamo; 1� on
Knight Relay, with 7 games; and so on.  The section on Losing
Chess (Giveaway) is 3 pages long; it may be a lot shorter in the
next edition, because someone claims in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Variant Chess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be on
the verge of demolishing the game.  There is a good short article
on 'Designing a chess variant', and the entry for Wildebeest
Chess summarizes Wayne Schmittberger's thoughts on the topic.
