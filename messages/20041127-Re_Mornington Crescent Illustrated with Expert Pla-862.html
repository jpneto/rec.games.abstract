Mornington Crescent of course refers to a faction of the Knights
Templar and has clear roots in Malta. What began as a medieval
discourse and secret method for communication amongst the fraternity
has morphed over the years into something entirely different. That
difference is considered by many to break into several parts each of
which, while fully self sufficient, contribute moreso to the whole.
The saying "The sum is greater than the parts" is one clue as to the
importance of Mornington Crescent on the original Latin, now English,
language in which the game is played.

With all due respect to the previous writer, the opinion expressed above
cannot be defended upon close examination of the primary sources,
particularly the papyri fragments from ancient Rome.  The opinion that
Mornington Crescent originates in a Knights Templar faction is of course the
thesis defended by Harley Moffat in his highly regarded historical work,
"The Origins of Mornington Crescent: A Historical Reinterpretation".  In my
view Moffat was misled by biased sources.  I am still in the process of
writing a refutation for the Mornington Crescent Journal on this subject, so
it would be premature for me to publish my views in this forum.  But suffice
it to say that Moffat's historical revisionism appears to have been the
result of poor scholarship and the early onset of the mental disorder that
led to him losing the Chair of the International Mornington Crescent
Foundation just two years after the publication of his book.  I have
evidence that appears to confirm the earlier conclusions of Johnson Dewey in
"A Comprehensive History of Mornington Crescent: From Origins to the
Medieval Era" (1826), the textbook that Moffat's work replaced.  As is
commonly known, Dewey's thesis is that Mornington Crescent had an ancient
predecessor with Viking clans in Norway and Denmark.  I will provide more
source material in my forthcoming Morning Crescent Journal article.  Is
Dewey's book still recommended for intermediate level students of Mornington
Crescent, or has his work been entirely disregarded by modern grandmasters?
