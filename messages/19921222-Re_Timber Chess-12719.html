the rule of the double-three is part of Go-Moku.  it is a "defect" in my
view, a necessary blemish on its purity.  (the "ko" rule in Go is its
"defect" and has had an accidental side effect of creating a very nice
feature, the ko-fight.  some "defects" in some games have absolutely no
function otherwise, such as "en-passant" pawn capture - now how in- what
was the circumstance that led to that rule??  i'd like to go back in time
and see where they came up with that one...:-))

I believe the origins were:

  Pawns could originally only move a single step forward (as they still can
  e.g. in Shogi, which comes from the same origins).

  To speed up the start of the game, the double pawn move was introduced.

  However, the double pawn move was only intended to speed up the game, not
  to allow a pawn to escape inevitable capture. So the en-passant rule was
  introduced.

  A similar thing happened with castling, which was intended as a speed-up
  rather than a way for the king to escape check or mate. Hence the rules
  about castling not being allowed in you're in check or the square the king
  is going to pass over is in check.

I've no evidence to quote on this, but I've read it in a number of places in
the past. So it's either the truth or a widespread legend :-).
