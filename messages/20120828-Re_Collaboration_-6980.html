now's the time.



Anyhoodles, here's an outline.  Goban, Player Black and Player White,

each with their own stones, exclusively.  One stone placed per turn

except after kills.  Odd sized board starts out empty, ends completely

filled.  Winner has most stones on board.  No moving stones.  Only

placing and removing.



NON-CYCLING MECHANISM: There should be opportunities to kill

singletons, or maybe multiple singletons per turn, or maybe groups,

around the middle of the game.  You begin your turn by placing a

single stone of your color, and if you don't kill anything, that's

it.  If you kill an enemy stone, you place another friendly stone

during your turn, and so on, until you make a non-capturing

placement.  (I don't like placing multiple friendly stones without

killing or any enemy stones).  ***So there ends up being one more

stone on the board at the conclusion of your turn.***  If you kill two

singletons, add two more stones.  This could be used for group killing

too.  Just require that you add as many friendly stones on your turn

(after your initial placement) as enemy stones you removed.  That's

plus one stone.



All that remains is a killing mechanism.  I think it would be cleaner,

given the outline, if singletons or multiple singletons were killed,

instead of groups, but can't rule out groups.



I wouldn't want it to be a variant of anything. Especially not Oust.



'Nother idea.  Hex starting out without colored sides.  The side

colors are determined during the game, based on shit that happens

during the game.  Might require a special tessellation, with colored

tiny cells interspersed among the larger cells, for example (just

thinking out loud, might not make sense).

Mark I like the idea of a collaboration but based on these requirements make it look more like you're commissioning games. As for the first project I toyed with a similar idea actually but it seems highly inessential as the captures fail to conserve board space. Essentially you are just flipping the pieces and moving them elsewhere so it didn't grab my interest. I'm not even sure what you're getting at with the latter one. Anyway I'd like to comment on some very general ideas regarding collaborating on a game. First off I don't think the kind of games that Luis or Nick or you or myself make lend themselves very readily to collaboration, they have only a few rules. If we were to collaborate I would at least suggest we start in an area that lends itself more to micromanagement such as working on a Chess variant. That could be hard to make finite and I would have a problem with putting my name on any cyclic game as I'm entirely sure you would. 

Since its relevant I thought I might bring up a much more ambitious project I've had in mind for quite some time now. My idea was to make a euro/civ type game which would essentially be a very complex scientifically calibrated abstract. The game would involve building a civilization with a resource based economy and warring with opposing civilizations with a global domination objective. This would all be achieved by applying the principles of architecture-centric design in order to build a highly complex integrated system of abstract games. I already have some  broad-strokes regarding a deck building mechanic and a few other things. If anyone is interested give me a shout.
