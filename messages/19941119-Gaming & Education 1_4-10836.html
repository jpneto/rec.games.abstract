DRAGON DREAMS

	With this issue, we complete our first year
of publication, but at the same time we are
at the beginning of a new school year. The cycle
continues, and much lies ahead. I shall wax
loquacious concerning some of these in separate
articles, but here I wish briefly to pose some
questions and make some announcements.
Please, respond.

	How are games educational? Why are they
educational? How can they be used? 
	What is the best game you ever saw used in
a classroom? How was it used? What were the
benefits? What were the reactions?
	How can we contact more teachers? What do
teachers want? What are teachers already doing?
	Publishers, what do you want? What do you have?
How have you promoted games in classrooms?
What frustrates you?
	Parents, how have you seen games used in the
classroom and by your children? What are the
benefits? What do you see that the rest of us
do not?
	Students, how can game use in the classroom
be improved? What do you want? What works best?
	What can you do to spread the word?

	This school year, this group is initiating several
larger, important projects.  The largest, National
Games Month, is much bigger than us and is detailed
below.
	First, we need to develop an annotated bibliography
of games for teachers. This will be a catalog of
games and curricula that help teachers plan and
purchase for their classroom. It will be indexed by
topic, age ranges (material, reading level, and so
forth), and publisher. We need reviews. We need
copies of games to test in classroom.

PUBLISHERS, WE CAN ONLY PUBLISH REVIEWS OF
GAMES WE HAVE SEEN AND TESTED IN CLASSROOMS.

Many of you are familiar with a variety of games.
If you can write a few paragraphs concerning the
use of a quality game in the classroom, please do
so and send it to us!
	Second, we are considering a directory of those
involved in this group. This includes anyone
receiving this newsletter. What do you think? If
you do not want your address published, it will
not be. This won�t happen for a number of months.
GAMA would have to approve the substantial
printing costs. Such a list could also be made
available on the Internet, but again, give it time.
	Third, we are developing materials for
non-gaming teachers interested in beginning to
use these games. If you have anything to
contribute to this, please get in touch with us.

	Mayfair Games and Avalon Hill Games both have
a deal for teachers. The former will send their
wonderful train games for classroom use FOR FREE.
Simply request it using your school or department
letterhead. Avalon Hill offers an across the board
40% discount for teachers. This is great! There are
surely others. Let us know.


	Lorece Altken of Pegasus Games in Madison,
Wisconsin sent us the addresses for all of the
middle and high schools in her community, and
we thank her for this. If you know of interested
persons or institutions, send us the address.
Here it comes!


NATIONAL GAMES MONTH &amp; ORIGINS �95
	July 1995 is scheduled to be National Games Month.
In coordination with Origins 1995, produced by the
awesome Andon Unlimited in Philadelphia, GAMA
hopes to promote games of all sorts, publishers,
and the industry as a whole to the largest possible
audience, including dedicated gamers and the nation
at large. They are seeking a presidential proclamation.
	There are several ways we may be involved in this
project. The focus is Origins which runs from July
13th to 16th. GAMA is examining ways to bring in
teachers, perhaps at a very low price or even free.
We may be in a position to offer seminars to our
largest audience ever, introducing many teachers,
classrooms, and students to the use of these
powerful games. Your support can make the difference.
	GAMA is also exploring the establishment of a
scholarship fund to be awarded during the game
convention. Will this be an annual event? We do not
yet know.
	GAMA is also planning a variety of other promotions
and events.  Watch for them in your area and in your
areas of interest. Encourage everyone to participate.
Most importantly, write to us now with what you
think will make this all work best.

GEN CON

by David Millians

	Gen Con was great fun and a fabulous success for
our work. I met so many new people, and we had
abundant time for discussions, both focused and
more discursive. It was wonderful to see you all.
I hope to meet you again next year, wherever possible.
	I led three seminars: Gaming &amp; Young People,
Gaming &amp; Education, and Gaming &amp; Prejudice. This
is exactly the order I prefer and the one I requested.
Each was a two hour discussion, though I often began
talking with some people well before our official
start, and we always found ourselves sliding
precipitously close to the next event, though we
gracefully avoided any conflicts.
	The first attempts to define games simply but
broadly, define young people developmentally,
then examine them in their real world context.
For those of you that attended, sounds pretty
impressive, neh? This was a good exchange of
questions and ideas. We spent much of the time
exploring the issues surrounding game clubs (and
game groups, families, school groups) with a broad
age range. Occasionally public game clubs find
themselves trapped between youthful interest,
gamemaster freedom, and parental ire. There were
a number of ideas, some of them contradictory as
is inevitable such a pluralistic discussion. If there
is interest, I can go into more depth with these at
a later date here.
	Gaming &amp; Education is the main course for me
personally. Two hours to talk about the delightful
and powerful discoveries of teachers in their
classrooms. It was good. Our teachers included a
librarian, a coast guard trainer, several graduate
students, and many others. Everyone is welcome.
We are all teachers. Suffice to say, I happily spun
tales (all of them true) of my own students over
the years and their valuable encounters with a
number of games.
	The third seminar explored issues of bias and
stereotyping both among players and within game
settings. This was the smallest of the seminars,
and for some reason it was scheduled in a smaller,
more isolated chamber far from the center of the
con. We had a great time. Issues of race and gender
came up early, as did the depiction of sexuality in
general in games. We discussed games that offer a
balanced opportunity and those that accurately
portray a society and its unspoken rules of conduct
and status. Everyone was respectful, but all
presented their own truly held ideas and opinions.
In examining the complex issues of children, our
world, classrooms, and games, these often sticky
issues are going to rear their heads. If I can teach
U.S. history to ten year olds, I can certainly (and
inevitably) discuss with them the thorny topics
of our times.
	These seminars generated a wealth of new
interest in our work. This newsletter is now
received by almost 400 people, and many more
read it through Internet postings.
	I was able to visit the vast dealers� room, and
it was a heady experience. The profusion of new
games, art, and even forms of games was
breathtaking at every turn. Many have immediate
applications in classrooms. Others are valuable
for their ability simply to bring people together
and stretch their thinking. Some games are
reviewed below, and if the many friendly
publishers cooperate and send us more games,
look forward to much more!
	On Sunday I attended the GAMA Board Meeting.
It was a serious affair. I presented our work
thus far and our plans for the near future. The
board was very pleased and immediately
supportive. For many member, this was their
first real chance to learn more about our efforts,
to ask questions. It went well. The board is
presently considering a permanent budget for
our work, allowing us to get a better handle on
our impressive growth and making possible much
future work. You will hear more about this as
we know learn more.
	Lastly, I was able to spend some time in the
child care area of the con. This secluded but
certainly not quiet service is provided by the
friendly and skilled staff of Klapper Day Care.
They have a well-developed program, from
registration to activities. I was impressed,
and interest in their services has grown every
year. The kids were having a wonderful time,
some playing games, some doing art, a few
napping. I think this is a great idea, especially
with the growing number of families attending
cons. If you are interested in knowing more,
I can put you in touch with them.
	It�s only ten months until Origins....


GAMA STATEMENT

What are the benefits of role-playing games?
	Role-playing games encourage reading skills.
Even the most simple of rule books require an
8th grade reading level to understand them and
many require much more than that. In addition,
many players go off and research the era in
which a game is set, which develops library
and research skills.
	Role-playing games encourage math skills.
Rolling dice, totaling them, adding and
modifying factors, subtracting them,
multiplying and dividing them by something
else are common occurrences in these games.
	Most importantly, role-playing games are a
social activity. Having a group of friends to
rely on during the tough years of adolescence
is invaluable, and role-playing games build
friendships that can last a lifetime.

Are there any drawbacks?
	As with any other activity, it is possible for
a player to become obsessed with games. It is
important for a parent to keep track of this
sort of overindulgence and, if schoolwork
begins to suffer or other undesirable
behaviors arise, speak with the child. As
role-playing games are built on communications,
speaking with a player and learning about the
game can relieve a lot of parental anxiety.

[So, what do you think? How can this be
improved? What is not covered? How can we
expand this to cover a much wider range of
games and questions?]


WAR GAMES

	" 'Charge!' The battle cry foes out and Allied
troops under the command of General Daniel
Schwartz advance and pursue the retreating
Napoleonic forces of Dr. Steve Fratt. Meanwhile,
in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Scott
Gilbert is trying desperately to persuade U.S.
President Joe Greenwald to come to his aid as
Arab leaders invade his country." (reprinted
from the article by Todd Hendricks in War Games)
	Dr. Steven Fratt of Trinity College, Professor
of History, uses a variety of wargames in his
classes: "In upper level classes I require a
semester-long research project and no tests.
During the final exam time, we game!"
	Dr. Fratt recommends two games focused on
the Vietnam War: Frank Chadwick�s Tet Offensive
wargame from GDW (P.O. Box 1646, Bloomington,
IL 61702-1646) and Vietnam Survival Tour, a
board game from MC Mets (3352 Darlington Road,
Holiday, FL 34691).


SPEECH! SPEECH!

by Marvin Scott

	I taught speech for a few years. Games have
some use in speech class. I used a simple card
set in a listening exercise. The objective was
to illustrate how hard it was to give a listener
an accurate idea of something the speaker was
describing.  I formed the class into groups of
five. I gave the speaker in each group a card.
The card had a design on it. Each design was an
essentially meaningless scribble. Some cards
were pretty geometric. One included a partial
silhouette of a squirrel, and another suggested
the shape of a World War II fighter.
	The speaker�s task was to describe the design
on the card. Each listener was to draw the design
on a sheet of paper. After a few minutes the
group compared the card with the listeners'
designs.  Then each group chose a new speaker.
We passed a new card to the group, and they
repeated the process.
	This exercise could be done using a fragment
of a role playing game. The speaker could
describe a room or creature, and the listeners
could try to draw it and compare their drawings.
	My students seemed more relaxed if they had
something in their hands, so early in the course
I had a speech about an object. One student
brought a bag of dice. I have heard dozens of
oral reports using model planes, tanks, or ships,
but these were history classes.
	Games are a potential source of speeches in
other categories. The "process speech" can be
about how to play D&amp;D, and the "controversial
speech" can address the question, Are role
playing games really dangerous?


REVIEWS

Black Death from BTRC is a straightforward,
somewhat abstract game of the plagues of
medieval Europe. Does that sound like fun?
You play the plagues! Greg Porter sent me a
copy, and I gave it to Peter Richards, who
teaches medieval history to nine and ten year
olds. They loved it! Peter was delighted! The
game presents a schematic geography from
the Levant to Iceland. Infectious diseases
spread westward, competing for regions
and cities. Very tongue in cheek, this game
allows students to explore the factors
contributing to these very real health hazards.
If you are teaching the Middle Ages to any
age group, give this a try.

Distant Seas has players compete for cargo
in any one of three time periods: sail, steam,
and modern. The rules are clear, and the
heavy-duty world map is accurate and easy
to read. This Monopoly of the high seas allows
students to learn the qualities that made for
profit and failure in each era. I have a copy in
my classroom, and while this is not the
simplest game, my students were drawn to
the eye-catching map, and they began playing
on their own. They preferred the modern era;
it�s the simplest to get started, but they
were intrigued by the meteorological rules
for the sail-shipping game. This game has
applications in studies history, economics,
geography, and technology.

Technopoly transports the familiar lanes of
New Jersey to the bustling lands of Silicon
Valley. Based on familiar rules and layout,
this game offers much that is new. The playing
track is mostly two-way and has several
sub-paths. Players compete for contracts
with computer manufacturers, network
developers, and military suppliers. The
opportunities for following directions,
problem-solving, and social brinkmanship
are many. Jim has detailed each technology
on the cards, but no knowledge of computers
or technology is necessary for play, any more
than you need a degree in hotel management
to play Monopoly. I have used this game with
strong sixth grade math students. By
unanimous acclaim, we took it on our class
camping trip: "In case of rain, David!" If they
can play Monopoly, they will enjoy Technopoly.

COMMUNICATIONS

	I have always used what I have learned in
role-playing to improve my interaction with
others. The ability to think more open-mindedly
and from different points of view has allowed
me to make a good impression with many people
and maintain meaningful relationships with
those around me. The problem solving skills
are useful, and settling arguments often enough
(I am currently GMing an AD&amp;D Dragonlance
campaign, and arguments arise more than
enough.) is helpful.
	Unfortunately, my parents and teachers think
that role-playing involves too much fantasy,
and they are waiting for me to outgrow it. My
parents strongly discourage it, mainly because
they focus on on all the negative aspects of
the materials, such as magical properties and
evil-looking creatures (They don�t realize we
play the good guys.). I'm not allowed to attend
any conventions, and this discourages me because
meeting other players is always interesting.

------------------------------------
	Dream Park is extremely simple, so much so
that students can learn the basics in less than
5 minutes.  Even advanced combat is simple,
yet convincingly cinematic.  Characters are fast
to create (5 minutes, less if you know the rules
already).  Best of all, because the game is
designed to mimic a simulation of reality
(ie. the Dream Park gaming domes) you can
easily mix and match genres and still maintain
play balance.

	I use Dream Park rules at school, mainly for
the speed that kids can learn them.  I've also
created a set of FileMaker Pro databases that
let the kids print up character sheets and
Qwik-Start cards (an abbreviated character
sheet), as well as equipment, skill, and spell
cards (business card-sized, giving all essential
information on one side and a picture on the other).

	RuneQuest is not as simple, but a lot more
realistic.  Its main strengths are a good, fast,
realistic combat system and a magical system
that can simulate every system of belief on earth.
Drawbacks are a longer learning curve and
longer character creation times (30+ minutes).

	I also use miniatures, mainly to help with the
visualization.  Most kids in the video generation
have a hard time visualizing a character until
they see a picture or figure.  Hopefully, next
year a few of them will actually dare to paint
their own miniatures rather than relying on mine!

Rob Prior

------------------------------------
I am a part of a gaming company called
TimJim Games.  We, in
association with Prism Games, manufacture
primarily board and card games.  We believe
that some of our games would be a pleasant
and useful addition to school curriculums.  In
particular, Fast Food Franchise, which is an
economic game reminiscent of Monopoly and
Acquire; Suzerain, a card game which
incorporates elements of feudalistic society;
and Age of Exploration, which allows players
to plan and run expeditions in the 1400-1500's.

I am hoping to get some idea of which
conventions and connections would be fruitful
for us to explore and you seem to be a
particularly good source.

*********************

  Salutations! My name is Travis Bryant, and I am
a senior at Northern Kentucky University. For my
English major and Honors minor, I will be writing
a complete role playing game. At the end of the
book will be a academic treatment of role playing
games in society. This will (hopefully) include a
study of the group interaction in RPG's, internal
and external views of the RPG hobby, and role
playing games as continuing oral tradition.

Around here, we run RPGs online, everybody
has to write their moves, and be very
specific about it. It seems to me that a 
similar setup on a computer, using a bbs
software in local mode for classroom use
only could easily facilitate the same kind
of action. One student could be GM, the
others players, each one gets a time online
to do their move and read others. If you 
have different groups with different
interests, they could participate in different
games. It could be an interesting way of
improving writing skills. 

In our online games we run the age gamut
from 10 to 44, and everybody has the
opportunity to express their characters in 
writing. We've got two games going now,
and one beginning, and another planned for
September, and we're just a small board.
