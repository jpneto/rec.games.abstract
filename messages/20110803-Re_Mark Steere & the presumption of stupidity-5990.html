Amazons is a better counterexample.  There's no presumption of stupidity
with Amazons.  It's a game I appreciate very much, but which would not pass
muster at MSG because of the non-standard pieces.  I actually enjoy playing
Amazons from time to time, which is saying a lot, since there are very few
games I enjoy playing.

This whole architecture notion is somewhat vague, even for me.  I'm
certainly not trying to claim "This is how it's done."  Only that this is
how I do it.  And not that architecture is guaranteed to produce superior
games.  Far from it, though the possibility certainly does exist, as I've
proven time and again.

Of course I highlight the advantages of my technique. Ego.  Architecture is
largely about robustness.  I design out draws because I find them repulsive,
especially cyclic draws.  And I know some percentage of gamers feel the same
way.  Those gamers won't have to be tortured by draws, and not too many
people object to the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>absence<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of draws (though some idiots actually do).

My only real foe is turn order advantage.  To me a game is a platform.  A
platform can be weak or strong.  A platform can buckle under increasing
load, just as a game can buckle under increasing skill - if it isn't robust.
 You take your best shot in building a strong game.  Sometimes you win and
sometimes you lose.

I'm really glad Amazons exists.  Before I knew about Amazons (Someone
introduced me to Amazons and I forget who.  Thanks "someone", whoever you
were.) I was concerned people would think I was a snot since I only liked my
own games.  Now, because of that one game, Amazons, I don't have to be a
snot.

Ego.  Not egocentricity.
