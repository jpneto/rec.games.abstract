Are you saying that any game that has a winner and a loser is a fighting
game?

Yes. I don't know how else you would be able to describe any game than
involves winning and losing. Mind tic-tac-toe doesn't have the
sophistication of the rock-paper-scissor games, e.g., those computer
karate games, or the games that require prodigious memory to master,
e.g., Chess and Go, I think it can be used to abstractly analyze the
fundament essences of "game" to form the conclusion that all games,
and I mean all games, are combat games. I suppose if you want to get
picky, you can label adult games like Chess and Mortal Combat "battle
games" and games like tic-tac-toe "silly little children's games." : )



I retreat to why I think you are trying to get away from a subject I
raised, the silly draw. I believe that is why you originally posted
your inquiry, "How so." Thought I'm not going to chastise you for it I
do want to make something perfectly clear, just because a game ends in
a draw does not mean it is not a battle game, e.g., I will use a
example from the core game I am stumpy thru, the game construct will
be design to where two players will sometimes have an opportunity to
battle over a breeder with highly desirable traits; the battle design
that the two players will use to decide the outcome can be from any
core game design and "glamorized, e.g. rock-paper-scissors into games
like Mortal Combat, etc;" now here is where it get tricky because of
having no other way of putting my crude thoughts out to the world,
and, by Jove, I am really a nice and down to earth guy, in the event
of a tie, the breeder is destroyed and neither player mates with the
breeder; so their might be an advantage to the draw, i.e., neither
play will really lose, and sometimes it maybe worth to battle even if
it ends up in a draw, never give your opponent an advantage, world and
breeder be damned .


Uh, that last part, uh, forget that, I'm really ashamed for starting
to get into the life of this little game I'm stumping thru alone : (
