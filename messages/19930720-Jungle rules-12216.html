Jungle is a 2-player abstract conflict played on a 7x9 board.
Here is the initial arrangement:

Blue moves first. Players alternate moves. A move consists of moving one
piece. Each piece moves, and captures by replacement, one square at a
time, horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Each piece has a
rank number and a corresponding animal name: 1-rat, 2-cat, 3-wolf, 4-dog,
5-cougar, 6-tiger, 7-lion, 8-elephant. The object of the game is to occupy
your opponent's den square. Red's den is 4a; blue's den is 4i. You may not
capture your own pieces. You may not capture a higher number piece than
your capturing piece, with 2 exceptions:
1. Piece 1, the rat, captures (and may not be catured by) #8, the elephant.
2. The 3 squares adjacent to your den (3a, 4b, 5a for red; 3i, 4h, 5i for
   blue) are your trap squares. you may capture any enemy piece in one of
   YOUR traps regardless of rank. #8 may capture #1 in this instance.
You may not occupy your den. Once a den is entered, the game is over.
No piece may move into or through the water squares (2d, 2e, 2f, 3d, 3e, 3f,
5d, 5e, 5f, 6d, 6e, 6f), with these exceptions:
1. The rat may move through water the same as on land; however, it may not
   capture the elephant from the water.
2. #6, the tiger, and #7, the lion, may "leap" across water IF:
   A. The move begins adjacent to water horizontally or vertically.
   B. Neither rat is on a water square in the path of the jump.
   C. The landing square is not occupied by a stronger or same color piece.
   To jump, move the lion or tiger across the water horizontally or
   vertically to the next dry land square. Any enemy piece of equal or
   lesser rank on this square is captured.
YOU MAY NOT make a move which produces a position (by "position" is meant
the arrangement of all the pieces on the board and whose turn it is) that
has already occurred twice before in the game, IF the piece you are moving
is capable of capturing the piece your opponent just moved (outside of
your own traps.) For example, if red has an elephant on 6h and blue has a
dog on 5i, red may not chase the dog back &amp; forth indefinitely between 5i
and 6i. Also, if blue has a tiger on 5g and red's rat is on the water square
5e, if each time the tiger moves to 5g or 6g the rat blocks the jump by
moving to 5e or 6e, the tiger must cease shuttling back and forth before
the same position occurs for a third time.
(This last rule was my own addition.)
