My sentiments exactly.  And I would add that I'm not criticizing
Ecalper's game tree either.  Just saying that there were a couple of
false premises afoot.  Partitioning a game into multi-move turns
doesn't increase the size of a game tree.  All that generally
accomplishes is increased vulnerability to first/second move
advantage.  I generally am not a fan of games like Hanniball (sorry
Christian Freeling) in which there's a seemingly arbitrary grouping of
multiple moves into turns.  I realize that's not the case with Ecalper
though, where the move grouping is integral and essential to the
game.  And a large game tree, or a large tree to board size ratio,
doesn't necessarily translate to a deep game, though certainly you do
want a large tree to board size ratio.

I just assumed Ecalper was Latin for something.  Game naming is where
abstract game design shifts from fun to work.  I saw a discussion on
bgg about abstract mechanisms relating to real world things.
Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.  Cephalopod.  That name
took longer to come up with than the design of the game itself.  I
realized the changing colors and spots would, if vastly speeded up,
resemble the changing color patterns on the skin of cuttlefish.  Not
that I was real satisfied with that name but I chose it anyway because
I was tired of beating my head against the wall for days. At least it
meant <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>something<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Oust.  Air freshener.  Selected it anyway because
I was tired of fucking around trying to find real world meaning for an
utterly abstract concept.

Tanbo was easier to name.  It kind of resembles plant growth, and
Tanbo is Japanese for rice paddy.  The best name is one that's
generally meaningless, such as Ecalper, or so I thought before Michael
explained the origin, but that's not a problem for me.  A game name
can be irksome though, if it's a really shiotty name, like Ketchup.
Sorry Nick, but that was painfully tasteless.  Please don't do that
again.  Yes, I get it.  You're catching up.  I'm begging you not to
discuss it further.
