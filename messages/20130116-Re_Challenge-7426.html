Why are you so hung up on Cephalopod?  Because you can't design a game that original and it's tearing you up inside?

Countless people have analyzed Cephalopod over the years.  Nobody has been able to discover a method for perfect play.  Nobody has been able to determine whether perfect play would lead to a first or second player win.  Nor does it really matter which one it is.

Cephalopod is implemented on seven internet servers.  That's seven more servers than any of your games are implemented on, because you're a zero and a monumental buffoon.

If you're so curious about Cephalopod, go ahead and submit it for "analysis" (lol) at xkcd.  You have my permission.  They'll get as far with it as everyone else has.  Nowhere.
