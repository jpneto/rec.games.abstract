Just for the record: Crossway is certainly a great game. It is light and quick and very funny to play on a real board against Go-only-players who get nerve wrecked when they're told that it's forbidden to cut! And if anyone would think the game is flawed or superficial: please challenge me, and beat me...

Thank you.  Crossway is not for everyone, but the few who like it like it a lot.  IMO you just have to be smart enough, which I for one am not.  There's more going on in Crossway than in Hex and it's hard to grok.  Some world famous Hex players totally fail at Crossway because it's over their head.

Btw, Corey Clark is a lowlife kibitzer.  Only a total piece of shit would butt in at the end of a long game and offer advice to one of the players.  What a fucking retard.
