You apparently don't like these people Bill and I don't know the whole
story, but what use is it then to post here?  You must have an
interest which goes beyond this petty drama.  I hope it's abstracts.


Concerning Rive:
Mark, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the rules.  This
sentence in particular,
"A stone must be placed so that the largest group it connects to is
minimal"
is it not,
"A stone must be placed so that the largest group it creates is
minimal" ?
....still for whatever reason I'm having a bit of trouble working it
out.  I'd blame the 60s but I grew up in the 80s and well... I guess
they actually might be worth blaming looking back :)

Mark or whoever understands the rules,
If you have the time I'd be interested to read an explanation in other
wording.  Maybe that will help.
I do find it interesting how far one can stretch finite gameplay onto
such a small board with just ordinary stones.  Now I just need to
figure out how to play correctly so I can see for myself how it
works. :P

Thanks,
Daniel
