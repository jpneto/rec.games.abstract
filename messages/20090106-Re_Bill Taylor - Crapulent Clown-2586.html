The message Bill quoted as though it had been posted yesterday was
actually posted on February 1, 2008, 11 months ago.  How has this
simple calculation stumped two supposed math enthusiasts?

Let me ask you something, Phil.  Why are you here?  Your only apparent
purpose here is to try and outwit the designers whose games you
purport to admire, a bizarre phenomenon that happens with surprising
frequency in the world of abstract games.   You're failing miserably,
with your well established pattern of interjecting yourself into
topics with which you're obviously unfamiliar.

You clowns can't seem to live without me.  Phil, don't you have
something to do?  How that mailing list of yours?  You know, the one
with three subscribers?  All of whom have long since killfiled you?
