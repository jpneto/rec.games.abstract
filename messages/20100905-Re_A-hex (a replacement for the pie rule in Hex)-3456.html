Hey Mark, it looks like I'm Corey Clark's latest target.  After
posting some critical questions about a game of his, a game that is a

I know, I read that.  It was totally psychotic.  You articulated the
point that his new game was a subset of Hex and he freaked out,
launching into this nanotube-thin strawman tirade.

"What??  My game is no more similar to Hex than Go is to Connect-4
Popout!!  You're saying my game plays horribly even though you admit
you've never so much as played it!!"

What a fucking weirdo.  By the way, that game in question is bullshit.

"Hey guys, I cut the face off Amazons and stapled it onto Hex!  Wasn't
that clever?"

No, it wasn't clever.  It was stupid.  What are you, Dr. Mengele?  You
created a subset of Hex, exactly as Michael Howe pointed out on bgg,
which charge you never responded to.

now copied my critical comments word for word, replacing his game with
a game I posted, and stuck it in the comment sections of my game.  I

When I first met Corey Clark it was clear that, in his mind, the two
of us had a well developed relationship already.  He was completely
obsessed.  The exact same thing happened when Ralf Gering introduced
himself to me.  I was the unwitting "other half" in an imagined, pre-
existing relationship.

Corey Clark is weirder than Ralf Gering though.  A lot weirder.
Gering just seems like a big pussy to me.  Clark really gives me the
creeps.

Pop quiz: Where would you most like to reside for a year:
A. Hawaii
B. Tahiti
C. The crawlspace under Mark Steere's house
D. Aruba

If you answered C, you might be Corey Clark.

Too bad, because Particle Bond is an excellent original game,

Yes, and kudos to Corey Clark for Particle Bond.  I invite active
designers to post their new games here.  Let's fill the void now that
the has-beens, wiseasses, and ignoramuses got chased out.
Rec.games.abstract is the perfect place for it.  But please, no Mr.
Potato Head shit, e.g. "Proust" - Oust hacked apart by Corey Clark.
