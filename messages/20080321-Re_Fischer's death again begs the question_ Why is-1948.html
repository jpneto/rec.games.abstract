<br>One problem with draws is that high draw rates bore the hell out of

<br>So you say, but as a potential spectator <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I'm<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> interested in 
quality play during a game, not the end result.

<br>pseudo-intellectualism.
<br></blockquote>
<br>If you were right this would have brought public interest in chess 
down to more or less nothing hundreds, if not thousands, of years 
ago.&nbsp; Yet it hasn't.&nbsp; Your pseudo-intellectial definitions of 
"robustness" conveniently ignoore this brontosaurus in the living 
room corner...
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Right, not <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>necessarily<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> dull.&nbsp; Not exactly a rave review.

<br>But a clear result isn't necessarily interesting either.&nbsp; It is 
potentially dull too.&nbsp; That's not a rave review either.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>This
<br>illuminates another problem with draws.&nbsp; They're not always the
<br>"welcome outcome among friends" that they are often disingenuously
<br>portrayed to be.&nbsp; What happens when your "friendly game" is taking way
<br>too long because your opponent refuses to agree to what is obviously a
<br>draw, claiming that he just needs "a little more time"?&nbsp; You can't
<br>force your opponent to agree to a draw.&nbsp; Yes, you can claim a draw
<br>(using the 50 move rules, etc.) in the presence of an arbiter, but
<br>when's the last time you played a friendly game of Chess with an
<br>arbiter on hand?&nbsp; Your only options are to continue inanely chasing
<br>each other around the board in a cyclic or nearly cyclic move sequence
<br>or to concede.&nbsp; Not real friendly.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You seem to have missed that playing with friends in a friendly 
manner avoids the problem by one's friends not exhibiting this sort 
of behaviour.&nbsp; First rule of any game: pick your opponents so you 
can all have a good time.&nbsp; Anyone playing a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> with someone who 
plays in such a way to render the exercise joyless has only 
themselves to blame.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Just the fact that you need an arbiter...&nbsp; It'd be fascinating to hear a
<br>definition of "robust" that would include the game of Chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's been hugely popular for a very, very long time, being played 
at all possible levels of seriousness.&nbsp; You can't achieve that and 
<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> be robust.&nbsp; You can't achieve that and be seriously broken in 
any way that wouldn't have been addressed <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>long<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> ago.
