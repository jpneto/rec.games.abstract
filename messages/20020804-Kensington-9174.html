This is an excellent, simple strategy game for 2 players.
It's long gone but is quite easy to make yourself (see
here). It was given to me as a lad at Christmas and is
one of the few games I kept from my childhood. It is
copyrighted to its inventors Brian Taylor and Peter
Forbes (© 1979). Kensington is so good it's a shame it
isn't available today. Taylor appears to have also
invented a game called Skirrid with another chap called
Mark Eliot, and another game called Ultimate published by
Paradigm. The blurb on both games indicates Taylor is
Welsh. I must write to him.

Sorry, but in my opinion Kensington is a great game!

That's encouraging.  I've always found it to be slow and lacking in tactical
variety.  But perhaps I haven't seen as deeply into the game as you have.
