<br>I'd like some opinions on these two games.&nbsp; 
Tantrix looks like it has more complexity and a puzzle mode, 
but how do they compare strategically?
<br>
<br>In addition, do you have any idea where I can buy either one of those?
<br>I'm in the USA (Texas to be precise).

<br>I've been playing Trax for about 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm strictly a mediocre 
player... too many other games occupy my time.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a good Trax 
player you have to actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.
<br>
<br>It is purely abstract, and a small player advantage (one player just a 
little better than the other) will often mean that the better player 
will completely dominate the other.&nbsp; It's frustrating for a player just 
learning the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; And sadly, anything that I've seen described as a 
handicapping mechanism makes it worse (the lesser player would not learn 
anything).
<br>
<br>The best you can hope for is a patient coach who will play with you, and 
point out fumbles and allow you to take back enough moves to learn from 
them.
<br>
<br>I run a play-by-email server (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@gamerz.net">pbmserv@gamerz.net</a>) that supports Trax 
(and over 100 other games).&nbsp; In fact, Trax was the reason I created the 
server.
<br>
<br>You can get more info on Trax (including where to buy it) at

<br>I've not played Tantrix (except in the puzzle form).&nbsp; But it looks 
interesting.
