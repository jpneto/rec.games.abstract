By the way, I'm still not completely sure that the standard

I wouldn't call that annihilation.  More like desertion, though not exactly.
 Annihilation is always a plus though, just because it's fun to annihilate
things.  It emotionally charges the game.  There can be "close games" in a
sense, but in the end someone has to either resign or get annihilated. 
There's no consolation prize.  No fistful of "points".  You lose, and you
lose hard.  Unless you win of course, which is always elating in a game of
annihilation.

I do like the benefit of not having to count up the score at the end.

No, but that won't stop me from opining.  I'm wildly guessing that the
"annihilation" version would have reduced clarity, just because it seems
like the ending condition could happen at any time.  Or something.  I barely
understand the rules though, and haven't played it.
