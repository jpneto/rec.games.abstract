I know you know that, which is what makes your persistence with the
outlandish claims so perplexing.

Nonsense will not be tolerated in rec.games.abstract, Christian.  Not by me.
 Not by Luigi.  Not by anybody.

You're playing a game.  "How much nonsense can I get away with here?"

The answer is zero.  It was zero last time, it's zero this time, and it'll
still be zero the next time you try.

You might have better luck at bgg, Christian.  Nonsense tolerance is through
the roof there.

My outlandish claim (quoted from "About Symple") :
Symple is a finite abstract perfect-information zero-sum game and as
such completely determined. That means that the truth of any position
- in this case a white win or a black win - is locked in the gametree.
To determine which of the two it is, it might as well be locked in a
black hole.
Hex, without the pie rule, is a proven win for the first player.
Checkers and Awari are proven draws. In Chess you can't prove
anything, but the arguments that white has an 'advantage' (note the
quotes) are questioned by few. Few, too, doubt that Draughts is a
determined draw, although it is not proven.
What makes Symple different is that you can't even argue one way or
the other, because as long as no growth has taken place, both players
have the option to trade move order advantage against limited growth.
Given the sheer size of the number of positions to consider - all
possible positions up to the first player growing - there will never
be any extensive exploration of one particular opening.

If nonsense tolerance is zero, I suggest you stop lol.
"I won't tolerate it", "Luigi won't tolerate it", "Nobody will
tolerate it", "God won't tolerate it" ... hahaha
