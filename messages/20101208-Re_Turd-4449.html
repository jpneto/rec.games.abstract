Christian I'd appreciate it if you took my name out of the description
of Monkey Trap. Heck, I'm not even fighting with Mark anymore. I'm not
sure how I became the victim of your Monkey Trap in the first place,
the only thing I said that you'd take offense to that I can think of
is that Query is your worst game. Buck up Christian! There are
designers out there with worse best games. Besides I thought you
already forgave me for saying that on iggamecenter and then you pull
this shit! (pun intended). Besides, do you really want people coming
to your site and reading about how you made a game purely as an insult
to some people you weren't getting along with online?

A few points here:
It was a joke.
You didn't think it was seriuous.
You were surpised.

You became the 'victim' mainly because I needed an opponent for Bill.
I don't think you're such a bad guy, you just easily get carried away.
You mention Query. I never said I was unlocking a new universe there.
But it isn't Quax rotated. Just as with "The Game Previously Known As
Turd", you fail to read the description (ah, you couldn't bear it, the
pain, the suffering :).

Not to put too fine a point on it, but my thread about Sygo@mindsports
didn't get a reaction at all. Since Query I invented 5 games, 8 if you
count variants, 11 if you take the alternative object in the three
Charybdis variants into account. Gonnect is such an 'alternative
object' game and it is commonly considered a game in its own right. So
are these.

I've gone through a productive period, and you didn't comment on any
of it. That's ok for other posters, but you claim the ownership of a
group that orbits around abstract games. You ignore my work or at best
misrepresent it. Why shouldn't I be allowed to joke about that?

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>loud, pronounced "bullshit" sound<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Come on Christian, you know this
is bullshit, so why did you say it? You're just trying to justify this
childish crap rather than set it right. I tried to get people to talk

The essay is called "How I invented games and why not". This is how I
invented Monkey Trap, why should I lie? I posted the game at the LG-
BLOG <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>without<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the nature of its genesis. Then, in the first comment,
a poster asks about my motivation (he seemed to have the impression
that I consciencely had simplified Amazons to make a kind of
'springboard' to that game).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

that's the other thing, you ended up making a pretty pointless game
that maybe there wasn't any point putting on your site in the first
place. Amazons is already made, this is on the same level as Twrs.

It's not a mild joke Christian, it's my reputation. Everyone is going
to think I dissed the great one Chris Freeling and I don't doubt at
least a few people will shun me and any games I might create over
this.
