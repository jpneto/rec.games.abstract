Hello.

  I was at a games-con this weekend, and I saw what I think is a
new game there. It's called Cover, and it comes in different sizes.
The variant I played is Cover4, but there is also Cover6 and Cover8.
The basic rules are the same, though.

  Here follows a transcription of a flyer I got from the guy:

&lt;Begin transscription&gt;

  Cover is a board game for two players. Cover can be
compared to games like Chess, Draughts, Go, etc.
  What makes Cover different is the longitudal form of
the pieces: the long side is the vulnerable side and
the short, pointing side is the aggressive side.
  Depending on the way a piece is positioned in the
field, it either attacks with its strong side, or is
attacked on its weak side. As a result of this premise
the tactics of Cover are very similar to the tactics on
a battlefield with guns, tanks or ships. On a deeper
level, everybody will consiously or subcounsiously
recognize the concept of strong and weak sides,
that are exposed in certain situations ("contexts").

  A Cover piece can make 8 moves. It can step
forward, backward, right and left, and it can make 4
different turns. Thus the "strength" of a Cover piece
can be compared to a horse on a chessboard. Each
Cover player has 4, 6 or 8 pieces, depending on the
board format. A simple definition of the complexity
of the game ois the number of alternatives, that a player
has to choose from when he makes a move.
  Cover4, the smallest board format, feels something
like the end of a game of chess. Both a horse and
the king in the chess game can make 8 different
moves. So playing Cover4 is just about as complex
as playing chess with something like two horses, a
king and some pawns. A game of Cover4 usually
takes 20-30 minutes.

&lt;End transscription&gt;

  I was going to make an attempt to draw the board in ASCII, 
and to explain the rules, but it's quite difficult to explain.
It's not difficult to learn the rules though: I saw it being played,
and I knew how to play it myself. After a short introduction
of the salesman, I was able to beat him in two tries.

  I'll try to make a computer-game out of it in the next three
weeks or so, if I have time. Meanwhile, if you ever see this on
display somewhere, be sure to look into it. It's entertaining.
