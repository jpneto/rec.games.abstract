Beautiful, sorry for my slow pace, I was put off track by your
previous comment:

At first, I considered having the opposite goal and was happy to name
it Splyt, but found that joining is more intuitive than splitting, and
that's what connection games are about in the first place. Of course,
with the right to place stones of both colors, the game is still
effectively the same.

Taking 'effectively' as not quite 'exactly'.

So you've designed a game that is not only identical with its misere
variant, but also is a Stavropol variant (i.e. moving with both
sides). If that had been the challenge in a design contest, the
contestors would probably have had a hard time and this would most
likely have been the winner :)

What about the square variant?
