He is simply lying openly without any shame.
I launched the idea 2 years ago (september 2014) by giving one example of game (knights). I said that the concept could be generalized to any game as long as we adapt it to the particularities of such game.
HE STOLE MY IDEA.
HE INVENTED NOTHING.
A HUGE COPY-PASTE.
What is really horrific is to see how people could lie "sin verguenza".
Stealing had become the mainstream rule. When you see Lady Trump (Melania) plagiarizing Michelle Obama without any shame so not surprising at all to see crappy designers like Luis and Clark plagiarizing me with no shame at all.
I will not keep mum anyway.
