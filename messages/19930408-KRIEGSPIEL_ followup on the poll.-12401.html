The Kriegspiel poll and vote managed to attract a giant response of
10 replies (including myself).


The figures were...

1:do you play "are-there-any"?         yes - 6            no - 0    other - 1

2:how many tries needed?      till capture - 4      only one - 2    other - 1

3:check announced                    plain - 4  by direction - 3

4:preferred style in (1)               yes - 8            no - 0    other - 1

5:preferred style in (2)      till capture - 4      only one - 4    other - 1

6:preferred style in (3)             plain - 6  by direction - 3

Interestingly, of those who play already, no-one preferred any different rules
from what they regularly played; everyone was SATISFIED as they were.

The most popular answer combination was a-a-a-a-a-a; that is, people who
both played (and preferred) :  use the "any" option, pawn capture tries must
then continue till success, announce check without direction. This was my
preference and style also, so I'm glad to see it borne out by the sensible
majority.  ;-)

Interesting extra comments were made as follows.

A: "Are there any?"
    =============
Those who favored the compulsory-capture rule were quite vocal in their
defense of it, clearly feeling strongly on the matter (as do I).

But certainly if you ask "are there any?" it should be the
equivalent of having tried pawn moves in a certain order, so you
should then have to make the pawn moves.

&gt;from having to explicitly try all possible pawn captures each move.

However, it should ACT like the player really did try all possible

This is the natural consequence of the above reasoning.  Otherwise a player

 We play with a hand signal, so
that the opponent does not know if we have exercised this option.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

...an interesting idea.

On the other hand, we have <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:cwitty@ai.mit.edu">cwitty@ai.mit.edu</a> (Carl Witty) who says...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
According to the rules I learned, if you have a pawn capture
available, the referee tells you, without any question on your part.
If you do have a pawn capture available, you can attempt pawn capture
at most three times; if all three fail, then you can't make a pawn
capture on that turn.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

...which is one I never heard before, nor dreamed of, and certainly seems
contrary to the spirit of the game, and "violates the underlying aesthetics".

B: Check announcements.
   ==================
Andy Latto <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:andyl@harlequin.com">&lt;andyl@harlequin.com&gt;</a> &amp; <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:hallyb@globbo.enet.dec.com">hallyb@globbo.enet.dec.com</a> (John Hallyburton),
both favored the direction-announcing option, going further by saying the
referee should announce not merely "check on a diagonal" but specify
whether long or short diagonal.

But again the majority favored the rule that gave no excess information,
which they (and I) clearly see as against the essential nature of the game.
Darse Billings was eloquent...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The same reasoning applies.  Let each player discover information only
through attempting various moves.  Giving additional information would seem
to favour the defender, since she may avoid stepping into greater danger.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Some suggested going even further, and not announcing check at all !

Joshua Zucker...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think that Kriegspiel should be kept clean and simple.  Even letting
someone know that he's put the opponent in check is a bit much to reveal.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Sometimes I think the game should be played without
announcing check, with the referee just announcing captures.  Perhaps
the game should just be played until the king is actually captured!
But it is much more fun when you have at least SOME information, so I
am willing to allow the usual "check" conventions that you stated --
both players know if a move results in check.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

And Darse Billings....

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
For that matter, another option, (d), is to not even annouce check, since it
will eventually be deduced if no "normal" moves are legal.  Of course, this
would make it much harder for the attacker to hunt down the King, since she
wouldn't know when she found the target.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Both seem somewhat hesitant with the suggestion though; and I agree with the
hesitancy, while being intrigued by the idea. I have considered it in the
past, and though I think it is a "cleaner" idea, must reluctantly dismiss
it in favor of (merely) announcing checks. One of the great skills of the
game is using one's King to scout about to discover the enemy layout by
checks, and it would be a pity to see this aspect disappear.

It's interesting though, that in this variant of chess (i.e. Kriegspiel), and
also in progressive chess, the "check" rule is far more valuable than it
is in regular chess, where it is nothing but a nuisance, and should be
discarded in favor of taking the king, as the spirit of the game dictates.
The official rules of chess are unnecessarily cumbersome because of the
unneeded (&amp; 2nd-order) concept of "check", and its miserable corollary,
stalemate, (which also contributes significantly to far too many draws).

But it seems we all agree that in Kriegspiel, check, &amp; announcing it, stays.

C: Other suggestions.

John Hallyburton comments...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Note that if a pawn capture is \en passant/ the referee so announces.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I forgot to ask about this, though it's so rare it hardly matters. My choice
would be NOT to announce it; as I have seen this lead to added amusement
(especially for the spectators!) when it occurs, and one player forgets
about the possibility, and madly casts about saying "but I've tried there"
and "there's no other possibility" and so forth.  A nice bonus to the fun !

Finally, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ember!pacolley@qucis.queensu.ca">ember!pacolley@qucis.queensu.ca</a>  observes...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Kriegspiel would be ideally suited to Email.  This would
also address your questions about "are there any?"  Each player could
be mailed the answer to that question with the result of their opponents move
(e.g., "nothing captured, and no pawn captures available").

Regardless, the player would submit a list of moves, and the aribtrator would
select the first on the list that is legal.

Anyways, I've never played.

Maybe someone could follow up on this suggestion......?
