Only small-minded players enforce their conventions rigidly. Better
players know that conventions establish a semantic framework which is
itself subject to manipulation in order to achieve strategic
goals. (FWIW, I'm a professional computer geek who specializes in
network protocols so my view may be slightly unorthodox - plus I'm a
notoriously successful 'psychic' bidder).

Errr. Well-defined is a very technical term for me, and I would

Well-defined is also a technical term for me. I think we are disagreeing on
the rules. See, for example,
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.acbl.org/info/laws97/node8.html#law40A">http://www.acbl.org/info/laws97/node8.html#law40A</a> which includes the
following:

----

A. Right to Choose Call or Play
       A player may make any call or play (including an intentionally
misleading call - such as a psychic bid - or a call or play that departs from
commonly accepted, or previously announced, use of a convention), without
prior announcement, provided that such call or play is not based on a
partnership understanding.

B. Concealed Partnership Understandings Prohibited
       A player may not make a call or play based on a special partnership
understanding unless an opposing pair may reasonably be expected to
understand its meaning, or unless his side discloses the use of such call or
play in accordance with the regulations of the sponsoring organization.

----

To me, the spirit is clearly different from the practice. I've partnered with
two mad psychics whose styles differed in ways that I knew but found very
difficult to convey to my opponents. I welcome a well-defined restatement
which agrees with the spirit without oversimplifying or overconstraining the
game.

Err...compatible.

I meant symmetric. See the above reference section E, though there is
probably a better reference which spells out why this restriction is used.

You're straying outside the 'well-defined' set of Bridge rules here. I
don't consider any bid illegal as long as it is well-formed.

These non-well-defined rules are the ones used in major tournaments, clubs,
and in all serious books on bridge that I know.
