I was speaking only in regards to first move advantage and absence of
draws, I tried to make that clear, sorry. I know you don't like their
architecture, I wasn't even talking about that. Only the results, not
how they got them. Of course under your system they aren't close to
perfect, your system is quite unforgiving. But I thought they fit the
model Gamer-man had given for such a "mythical perfectly decisive
game" and that's all I meant.

I'm new here so I don't know all the conventions, sorry.
