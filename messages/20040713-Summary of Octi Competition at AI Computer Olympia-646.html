Octi 6x7 Match 2004: Casbah  vs. Testme2
Best of 5 Tournament.  First two games played at 2 hours apiece.  Last
three games played at 30 minutes apiece.

Game 1:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2253&amp;start=20">http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2253&amp;start=20</a>

A quick strike by casbah and sluggish defense by testme2 allows casbah
to
run up the right flank, pinning down testme2's pieces long enough to
allow
casbah's reserves to finish the job.

Casbah goes up 1-0

Game 2: 

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2256&amp;start=10">http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2256&amp;start=10</a>

A strange game in which Casbah again launched a solo attack with a
single
piece, this time as player 2.  To make things even more odd, it
charged
into the teeth of testme2's defense and effectively conceded defeat on
turn 16.

Game 3: 

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2261&amp;start=10">http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2261&amp;start=10</a>

Casbah again charges from the corner as player 2, but this time the
bold move to the center seems to confuse testme2, which  seems content
to slowly develop three pieces.  Casbah is able to settle down into a
stable T formation and draws testme2 into a trap on move 17. 
Testme2's advance proves costly.  Short on both tempo and pieces,
testme2 is gradually overwhelmed by Casbah's 4 piece formation. 
Casbah leads 2-1.


Game 4: 

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2262&amp;start=10">http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2262&amp;start=10</a>

Games 1 and 3 showed that Casbah was capable of winning as either
player 1 or player 2.   What could have been the clinching game put
Casbah in the position of playing first, which seemed to work to its
quick-attack proclivities.  This time, however, Casbah made a mess of
it, hanging his maing piece on 54 while Testme2 patiently turned up
the heat by building up a three-pod formation.  Eventually, Casbah
settled for an exchange, which allowed testme2 to set of an elegance
offense/defense that immediately captured Casbah's only armed piece. 
The flanking attack in Game 5 was a pale imitation of the deft attack
in Game 1.  Series tied at 2-2.

Game 5:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2264&amp;start=10">http://www.octi-online.com/index.py?action=archive&amp;view=2264&amp;start=10</a>

So it all came down to Game 5.  Casbah, playing first, as usual opened
from the corner and quickly advanced to 43.  But this time, Casbah
paused to develop the pod at 22, which seemed out of touch with the
rest of the formation.   Testme2 sealed off Casbah's advance with a
move to 45.  Instead of solidifying its position with 43-33 (using its
E prong to defend its right flank), Casbah advanced the pod at 22-33. 
 This pod would become an increasing liability as testme2's back lines
patiently built offensive capability.  Eventually, Casbah was forced
to try a gambit of 33-42.  Under other circumstances, this move would
have been a springboard for the pod at 43, but here it resulted in
capture and no gain in tempo.  Testme2 uses its materiel and
positional advantage to close in on what remains of Casbah's position.

 Testme2 wins the tournament 3-2.

Congratulations to Jeff Bacher (programmer of testme2) and Charles
Sutton (programmer of Casbah) for a great match.
