I was reminded of this card game, known under many different names, by the
recent post here on "Egyptian Ratscrew"; which is Beggar-my-neighbor with
a bit of "Snap" thrown in.

(Incidentally, I used to know Beggar-my-neighbor as "Strip Jack Naked"; does
 anyone know of any other old names for it?)

As a reminder: 
-------------  In Beggar-my-neighbor, each player starts with half the shuffled
pack face down, and flips over one card at a time into a centre pile. When a
face card appears, the other player must then play a run of consecutive cards -
4 for an ace, 3 for a king, 2 for a queen, 1 for a jack. If this run of cards
contains no face cards, the original face-card-player takes up the centre pile
and adds it to the bottom of his own pack; but if the run produces a face card,
this instantly stops the run and the opponent must then start on a run, length
being determined by the face card that stopped the last run. The eventual
winner of the centre pile leads the first card to the next round of play.

The loser is the first unable to play when required.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As it stands, the game has no skill whatsoever; but I have a suggestion for
making it a good game to play, and also a query about the game as it stands.


QUERY:  Is it possible for the whole deck to cycle around indefinitely?
=====
I've seen this question asked, now and again, for quite a while. 
For vastly reduced decks it is possible to find such deals.  

A very simple one is: 

With a pack containing only 2 Jacks              Starter:  x x J x
and 7 plaincards, the initial deal is...           Other:  x x x J x

I recall seeing other solutions, but none with much bigger decks than this.

If anyone can construct a cyclic layout using a bigger deck, please post it.
We could even get a record-breaking contest going !  Chocolate fish awarded
to the biggest deck with a cyclic layout posted; and to the deck with most
face cards in it.


SUGGESTION:
==========  For those who would like to try a playable game that is as little
different as possible from the original, try this with a friend.

Instead of blindly playing the unseen top card, you hold your deck fragment the
other way up, still closed up though, so you can see the bottom card only.
Whenever it's your turn to play a card, you may choose EITHER the card you can
see, OR the invisible card from the other end, (which is a complete gamble,
unless you can remember it!)

When you win the centre pile, don't immediately rejoin it to your hand, but
place it in front of you, closed up, with the last-played card up visible. Add
on any further winnings to this in the same manner. When you've run out of cards
just take up your winnings pile and continue playing (just as in the original
game, in effect).


We've found this version to be quite fascinating.  There is quite a bit of
scope for strategy. Memory plays a big part, but not an overwhelming one;
though obviously one should remember <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>at least<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> your last winning card, and
play off the hidden plain cards to leave the face card at the invisible end,
ready for an emergency play.           Give it a try !
