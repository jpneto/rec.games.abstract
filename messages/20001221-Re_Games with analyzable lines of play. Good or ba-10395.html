I thought this was worth verifying. Approximating the number of chess
positions as the number of ways of putting 32 pieces on a board
(that ignores 31 or fewer pieces options, but that's only one order
of magnitude, and pawns on invalid ranks and other illegalities, but
that's unlikely to make that order of magnitude back) gives

64!/32!/8!/8!/(2!)^6 = 64C32 x 32C8 x 24C8 x 16!/64 = 4.6x10^42

Call it 10^43 in round terms. The sun masses 2.0x10^30 kg, the mass of a
proton is 1.7x10^-27 kg, so the sun is about 10^57 atoms, so that's
about 10^13 atoms per chess position. I'm not sure I'd call 13 "many"
but that's just a quibble. It's of the order of 10 picograms per chess
position. How many atoms per transistor these days for comparison?

Imagine yes. Not before 2020 as was suggested here (not by David).

Now that's the interesting assertion. Obviously I can see why not all
positions would have to be considered. I can't see a convincing argument
why this reduction is significant, let alone many orders of magnitude.
This is based on the assumption that we use backwards analysis from the
end of the game. Using forwards analysis from the start of the game we
have to consider something closer to the number of all possible games,
not just all possible positions, and that's where the numbers get really
big (none of these pitifully small 10^43 size numbers).
