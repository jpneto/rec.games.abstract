Hey Guys,

First off.  Sorry for the negligence.  I've been traveling for too
long.  Looks like we have a bit a messy situation, but I can't imagine
it's very hard to set things onto the right track.

QUESTIONABLE ENTRIES:
I've played a few of the games and there are at least two which
possibly don't fit the contest requirements!

Stax - hidden information
Monkey Queen - I can think of arguments for and against whether this
is a stacking game or not.

just a note: *The stacking element definition was purposefully loose
from the get go to motivate creativity and interesting games.*

....and just to state the obvious - this is not about the inherent
quality of either of the games

Thoughts?

VOTING:
I considered the following 2 things to be important in the voting
process to encourage people to vote.
1.  You are not required to submit a game to vote.
2.  You are not required to play every game to vote.
....and 1 thing was important for receiving entries into the contest:
1.  You are not required to vote if you submit a game.

there are a slew of voting systems:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system</a>

One I thought might be interesting would be that you vote for your
favorite game and that your vote value increases for every different
game that you play.  If I play 5 games then my vote has more value
than someone who plays 1 game.

This could encourage people to play more games without losing the
people who didn't manage to play a couple of the games in the end.  If
in addition everyone gave the names of the games that they played then
we could also publish which games got played by how many voters.

In a perfect world you could only vote on a game once you beat a
certain level AI to ensure you explored it's strategic depth to the
desired extent :D
Thoughts?

DEADLINES:
Is it 9th of February or March 20th?

I like Nate's suggestion of a yearly competition which starts at
winter solstice and ends at the spring equinox.
That would make this contest
WS Dec 21st 2010 -
SE Mar 20th 2011
In this case I'd put the due date on the entries at March 1st (easy to
remember) and the due date on the voting at March 20th.
I see no harm in implementing this now as it seems fairly ideal for a
yearly standard.
What do you think?
