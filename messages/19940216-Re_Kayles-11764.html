It sounds like the first player could always win by dividing the line into
2 identical regions on the first move. If n is odd, remove the middle token.
If n is even, remove the 2 middle tokens. Now any move the 2nd player makes
is answered by the corresponding move in the other region. The 1st player
must always win with this procedure, n'est-ce pas?

you proposed does not work (depending on how you interpret "corresponding",
which I take to mean "identical").  In particular, if n= 3 or 4, then clearly
this does not work.  If n=5, then the proper 2nd move for player one is the
"opposite" of player two's first move (ie, if player two took one, player one
should take two, and vice versa).

Alright, I'll be more precise: After the 1st move by player one, the tokens
are labeled a(1),a(2), ... a(k) for the region on the left, and
b(1),b(2), ... b(k) for the region on the right, where k=(n-1)/2 if n is odd,
and k=(n-2)/2 if n is even. Each move player two makes in region a is answered
by removing the token/those tokens with the same number/numbers in region b,
and vice-versa. Consider for example n= 3. Player one removes 1 from the
center leaving:   X.X  Now if player two removes the X on the left, player
one removes the X on the right and wins. Or are you assuming the player who
removes the last token is the LOSER? That's an interesting idea, and certainly
my strategy would not work in that case, but that's not what the initial
posting said...
