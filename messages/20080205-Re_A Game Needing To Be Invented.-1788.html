I don't have a solution to the given problem, but I think I can offer
a variant of Mind Ninja that encourages patterns with only the
properties you want, whatever they may be.  The process might be too
cumbersome for enjoyable play, but it maybe it will inspire something
better from one of you.  Let's say we'd like to play a variant of Mind
Ninja which encourages only YMMV patterns.  You could set it up like
this:

Any time after the pattern has been proposed but before the game is
over, the player who <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> propose the pattern can set up a
position on a separate board which demonstrates that the proposed
pattern is not YMMV.  In this case, he would have to set up a
completely filled board which either contains the both pattern and
it's putative complement, or doesn't contain the pattern or the
complement at all.  If he can do so, he instantaneously wins.  Now the
pattern proposer has clear incentive to propose only YMMV patterns.

I think you would need some other rules tweaks to actually play this
(like for example you'd have to make sure that you'd be able to
actually define the complement for the proposed pattern first), but
the tweaks might not be so hard to come up with, and anyway you get
the idea.
