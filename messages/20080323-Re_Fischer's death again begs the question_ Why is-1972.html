<br>I think it is.&nbsp; Note that, for example, you see very few
<br>short draws in 5-minute chess, and not that many in rapidplay
<br>tournaments or correspondence chess, though the scoring is the
<br>same as in slow chess.&nbsp; If you're not "in the mood" for those
<br>forms of chess, then you simply don't turn up for the fast ones,
<br>or you take a day off for correspondence;&nbsp; whereas in a trad
<br>tournament, you have to turn up over several days and play each
<br>round whatever your mood.&nbsp; Likewise, in league chess, you owe
<br>it to your club to turn out even if you've just had a bad day
<br>at the office.

<br></blockquote>
<br>You seem to be under the impression that "winning chances"
<br>are always there and are being overlooked because players prefer
<br>to take draws.
<br></blockquote>
<br>And you seem to be saying that chessplayers' behavior
<br>is unaffected by the external scoring incentives that affect
<br>their prizes. Players don't look for winning chances if they
<br>calculate that they come with greater losing chances.
<br>How many times do we read game analysis if words
<br>akin to "he took the safe draw"? Draws wouldn't
<br>be safe if the scoring were different.
<br>
<br>
<br>Certainly there is an element of temperament
<br><blockquote type=cite>involved, and some players are very hard to beat whereas other
<br>delight in taking risks.&nbsp; Changing the meta-game may indeed cause
<br>players to take more risks;&nbsp; the idea that this is better chess
<br>seems to me to be fanciful, especially when it will remain the
<br>case that only the most knowledgeable spectators are any the
<br>wiser.&nbsp; If you simply want more razzmatazz about chess, there
<br>are easier and better ways to achieve it.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Decisiveness can increase interest even with no
<br>understanding of the underlying games. Don't
<br>newspapers in the UK have sports sections?
<br>Here they do. Even in the absence of real time
<br>suspense, or stunning visuals, people like to
<br>follow results. None of the sports covered in
<br>our newspapers have the characteristics that
<br>60% of encounters end in ties, with
<br>a significant number of those occurring without
<br>even playing, though.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast majority of games/sports
<br>etc. simply don't have an "I'm not in the mood, let's draw" option
<br>and neither would chess with sensible scoring.
<br></blockquote>
<br>In most cases, this is intrinsic to the game itself.&nbsp; There
<br>is little or no equivalent in golf or tennis or go or the high-jump
<br>to the chess position that has resolved itself to bare kings, or
<br>even to KRP vs KR in a position that is a book draw known to both
<br>players.&nbsp; But there are plenty of examples of boring games/matches
<br>in sports such as football and boxing, where "spoiling" tactics
<br>are possible.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>The rules of chess guarantee that draws have to be
<br>accounted for. The scoring system of chess guarantees
<br>that draws dominate the game.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>It's especially
<br>offensive that this occurs in the last round of every major
<br>tournament -exactly when, in ordinary non-chess competitions,
<br>the drama is at its highest.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Many sports organise their major competitions as KO
<br>events, which puts a different complexion on things.&nbsp; In
<br>leagues, it is very common in the sports I know anything about
<br>for end-of-season matches to be meaningless -- almost all issues
<br>of promotion or relegation are decided, and most teams just go
<br>through the motions.&nbsp; Why would you expect chess tournaments to
<br>be different?&nbsp; If you've just had 10 days of gruelling mental
<br>activity, it's not surprising if on the 11th, with nothing at
<br>stake, you don't want to take it too seriously.&nbsp; Even if there
<br>is still something at stake, you may be in no mood to put yet
<br>another six+ hours of thought into it.&nbsp; Been there, done that.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Come on, now, you've got to be kidding. In chess, it is
<br>the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>leaders who have everything to play for<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> who play
<br>the 15 move draws. Why is having to *play
<br>chess* considered a hardship for professional chessplayers?

<br>when playing, they will look for winning chances.
<br></blockquote>I don't know what sort of chess you play, but I don't know
<br>any players to whom that does not already apply.&nbsp; For a start, we
<br>all, except for the merest beginners, often play against players
<br>who are worse than us.&nbsp; That is especially true for the world's
<br>strongest players.&nbsp; If a GM sits down to play me, do you suppose
<br>he is looking to "hold the draw"?&nbsp; So we all need repertoires that
<br>give us a decent chance to win against slightly or very inferior
<br>opposition, whatever the colour.
<br></blockquote>Irrelevant. Nothing says that they have to play the same
<br>openings against weaker players as they do against their peers,
<br>and frankly I'd be surprised if that were the case.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Irrelevant.&nbsp; Very few games are played between genuine
<br>peers.&nbsp; To get to a "soft" draw needs <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> players to agree.
<br>If I play a drawish opening against a stronger player, it's his
<br>problem to steer it into lines with winning chances;&nbsp; if I do
<br>that against a weak player, it's my own fault if I only draw.
<br>[Though as a matter of fact, it's usually a mistake to "play
<br>for a draw" against a strong opponent.]

<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Is there a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>practical<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> "downside"?
<br></blockquote>Well, it mucks up rating.&nbsp; Either ratings can't follow the
<br>points, or else you have built in inflation.&nbsp; That's a "practical"
<br>problem;&nbsp; whether it matters is something else.
<br></blockquote>The fix is trivial.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Not really.&nbsp; You are going to get cases where player A
<br>scores more points than player B [who gets more draws] against
<br>the same standard of opposition, but B gets the higher rating
<br>as a consequence.&nbsp; Many players are somewhat precious about
<br>their ratings, so that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> going to cause problems.
<br></blockquote>
<br>The rating system has a definition of "performance" defined
<br>as (W+D/2)/(W+D+L) which is purely arbitrary. Use
<br>a different definition and all problems are solved.
