<br>Except I quoted one study which shows it happens in sumo. You
<br>don't need to identify which are the thrown games, just show that
<br>statistically quite a few clearly are.

<br></blockquote>
<br>You just don't get it. Changing the scoring system (which addresses a
<br>problem the people who actually matter don't seem to mind, but no
<br>matter) would makes cheating profitable. Mathematical fact. Where
<br>cheating is profitable, people will find a way to cheat. Pretty much the
<br>definition of the human condition, with mountains of supporting
<br>evidence.
<br>
<br>But arguing with you is a waste of time, I'll take someone else's
<br>earlier advice to give it up.
