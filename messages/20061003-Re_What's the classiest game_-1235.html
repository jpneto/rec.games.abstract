<br>Untrue, because there is an element of psychology in simultaneous move games

<br>&nbsp; No, that's not what he said. I got it backwards at first, too, but then
<br>I stopped to think about his example. He said, in effect:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can simulate a die roll with simultaneous movement.
<br>
<br>The converse is definitely <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> true; you can't simulate simultaneous
<br>movement with a die roll.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; This theorem was I think introduced in this thread to counter the idea 
(a straw man nobody's really arguing, IMHO) that, say, Snakes &amp; Ladders
<br>could be <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>superior<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> to a game with no explicit randomness but with
<br>simultaneous movement; because you can rewrite the rules of Snakes &amp;
<br>Ladders, using simultaneous movement to determine each die roll, and
<br>you'll get an equivalent game with no explicit randomness.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; To put it another way: A die roll can be simulated by a zero-sum game
<br>where your optimum strategy is to move randomly; and vice versa. However,
<br>there <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> zero-sum games with <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>different<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> strategies, and these games
<br><i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>cannot<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> be simulated by die rolls.
