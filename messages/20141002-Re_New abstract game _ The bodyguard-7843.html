Rings don't particularly appeal to me but dice do.  And I was inspired by your dice game.  I spent a few days, or nights I should say, when I couldn't sleep, trying to come up with a luck/strategy game for dice, and didn't get anywhere.  Maybe I'll return to that and see if I can make any forward progress.

I still did not finalize the rules. No easy to fix the cycles.

Has something to do with pieces being killed and re-born in marked corner squares?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The idea is to create 2 kinds of moves : rings (bodyguards) can move only if they are empties (no token inside) and only to an empty square. Tokens as long as they are inside the rings can not be captured. But tokens can not jump directly from the rings. They have to jump one square away before making any move. But as they jump one square away from the ring any opponent token can capture them. They become vulnerable to attacks so they have to jump to a square where they are not under attack. Rings are neutral pieces. They move orthogonaly (when empties from token). So the fight will be how to move the rings to the cell in the corner? Rings can be captured by others rings as long as they are "empties". My problem is : how to make only few rings reach near the corner. The condition to win is to have first the empty ring in the corner then a player has to put one of his token one square from the corner to win. He has to be in safe square (not captured by his opponent token) or protected by other tokens (kill me I kill you but with an advantage to the player who is near the goal.
My big problem is how to avoid cycles?
Rings are neutral so any player can move them. So there a need to avoid a cycle. If a player move a ring in some direction and his opponent move it in the opposite this will create a cycle.
Other cycles need to be fixed.
Other situation of blockade too. The more the rings are moved to any of the corners the more no one can kill the other because the rings will become a barrier if they form a compact chain. 
So I`m still thinking if I have to split my tokens in 2 or 3 : token jumping token (like knight or any other kind of jumping move) not jumping, capturing in some way not another and so on.

I`m work with 1 ring 1 token against 1 ring 1 token in a board 5*5 to see how it works.
I still have to fix many problems.
I`m tired too because of sickness.
I will think to all this problems later.
To make you understand my goal I gave just some hints and I forget many.
So here we are.
I have no problem whatsoever if you build a game similar.
Do not worry as long you do not intend to sell it.
We can create a chess variant based on rings (bodyguards) and the usual pieces used to play a chess. Maybe in a board 10*10.
