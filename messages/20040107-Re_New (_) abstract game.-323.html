Joao Neto and myself have discovered a new abstract board game, which seems
so natural that I'm sure it must have been discovered before.

We initially played it on a hexagonal board, but it seems just as adaptable
to rectangular, which we are trying now.

I have played something slightly different, on a rectangular board (5x5
or 5x6 were popular for quick games) which we consider to have 8-way
connectivity so that diagonal lines are allowed.  The first player draws
any legal move, and subsequent moves are allowed to continue from either
"free end", with the game ending when both ends are trapped.  (It might
need to be explicitly stated that it is illegal for a move to end on or
cross through current location of the "other end", although this seems
obvious to me.)  Much of the strategy goes into controlling when the
ends become separated, so that each is in an independent "room", similar
to controlling the opening of corridors in dots-and-boxes.  We had no
name for this game that I recall, and I didn't even recall the game
itself until your post reminded me.  I'd like to hear more about the
variations you try.
