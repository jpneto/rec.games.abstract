I agree that card counting is a very important ability in Kahuna but I
disagree that it's "obvious" which islands your opponent can attack.
Since an island may be "attacked" using cards for "neighbouring"
islands it's much harder to know where you're vulnerable.

I agree with this general principle but it's rather meaningless in
practice. The only way to guarantee that you can not lose an island is
to control it and all adajcent islands. In order to control adjacent
islands you must control all islands that are adjacent to that one. In
effect you must control every island on the board.

Again, I mostly agree with this but would not use the term
"never-ever". It's not unlikely that two adjacent islands are
controlled by a single player with a slim, one bridge majority on
each. If the other player has 3 of the 4 cards for a bridge linking
these two islands then by playing all three he can remove the critical
bridge, replace it with his own, take control of both islands and
remove all his opponents bridges. (Which is likely to cause the loss
of further islands.) A very efficient use of three cards. Now this
won't occur all that often as it's rare for a player to have 3 of the
4 cards necessary to pull it off but it's occurrence is greater than
"never-ever".
