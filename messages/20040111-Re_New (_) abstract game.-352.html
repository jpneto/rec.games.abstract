Joao Neto and myself have discovered a new abstract board game, which seems
so natural that I'm sure it must have been discovered before.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The original game seems to have a couple of disadvantages, if it's ok
for me to say so. Large portions of the board can be left unplayed,
and in the beginning of the game there is a lack of strategic
principles guiding good play, leading to one move being as good as any
other.

I propose a couple of additional rules. First, each move must change
the direction of play. This seems natural to me and seems to improve
the play of the game, at least in conjunction with the second rule...

....which is that the game must end with all points of the board played
in, and each move played must allow this to happen. That is, a player
may not make a move if it does not allow the snake to subsequently
fill the board completely.

This has some interesting effects. A point with only one neighbour is
a cul-de-sac, and the game must ultimately end on that point. To
create a second cul-de-sac would be an illegal move, since both cannot
be filled.

This game is quite playable on a hexagonal board. But on a squared
board with only orthogonal moves (no diagonal moves) the game takes on
quite a different character.

On a squared board the fact that each move must change direction means
that one player will play only horizontal moves, and the other player
only vertical. If a cul-de-sac is created then it will be immediately
apparent which player will play the final move into it to win. But
beware! There is a checker-board parity effect which determines which
squares/points the snake can end the game on. If a player creates a
cul-de-sac of the wrong parity he loses, since the snake can no longer
visit the entire board.

Here's the full rules. Play on a rectangular grid of dots. The first
player  highlights a dot by drawing a small circle around it. The
second player draws a vertical line from this dot of any length. The
first player then extends the line with a horizontal segment, again of
any length, and so on horiz, vertical, horiz etc. The snake so formed
may not cross or touch itself.
At any time instead of moving a player may challenge their opponent to
complete the snake such that it passes through all the dots. If the
opponent demonstrates this can be done then the challenger loses, if
the opponent can't then the challenger wins. (In practise this rule
should never be invoked between good players.)
The player who makes the last move wins.


Here's a sample small game:

  . . . . . .
  . . . . . .  Horizontal starts by selecting the snake's starting
  . . o . . .  point.
  . . . . . .


  . . . . . . 
  . . ¦ . . .  Vertical plays length two up the board.
  . . o . . .
  . . . . . .

  ._._. . . .  Horizontal plays two to the left. Vertical would now
  . . ¦ . . .  like to make a long line down to the corner to leave 
  . . o . . .  a cul-de-sac which he will be the one to play into. 
  . . . . . .  But that would not allow the board to be filled 
               (due to parity) so he must play...
  ._._. . . .
  ¦ . ¦ . . .  one down. Now horizontal has no choice. 
  . . o . . . 
  . . . . . .

  ._._. . . .  Vertical cannot now play two down since that would 
  ¦_. ¦ . . .  split the board up and the full snake could not be 
  . . o . . .  played. So vertical must play a line of length only
  . . . . . .  one. The subsequent horizontal and vertical moves 
               are also forced...
  ._._. . . .
  ¦_. ¦ . . .  ...leading to this position.
  ._¦ o . . .  And now all moves lose for horizontal. Here's one
  ¦ . . . . .  continuation.

  ._._. ._._.
  ¦_. ¦ ¦ . ¦
  ._¦ o ¦_¦ ¦
  ¦_._._._._¦


Note that horizontal could not have played to the right on his first
line move, e.g.:

  . . ._._._. 
  . . ¦ . . .  
  . . o . . .
  . . . . . .

because the snake will eventually have to pass from right to left
along the bottom row under the circled dot into the left hand portion
of the board, where we can see even now that vertical will have an
easy win. So even though there are many ways the right portion of the
board can be completed it's all irrelevant: vertical will win.

The game can be played on fairly large board sizes with both players
engaged in tactical considerations from the start. Probably 10
horizontal by 8 vertical would make a reasonable game. A rectangular
area tends to favour the player playing in the direction of the longer
side, but vertical has the advantage of making the first line segment.
(At least, I think this is an advantage.)

The parity of the board edges makes a difference to play. Even x even
or odd x even board dimensions possibly give the best play, but odd x
odd certainly works too. If chosing the start point on an odd x odd
board be sure to  remember the checker board parity and chose a dot
from the more prevalent checker board colour, otherwise you'll lose
immediately if challenged.
(Against a novice player it might be worth chosing a wrong start point
in the hope they make a move, in which case you can challenge.)


Anyone care to analyse a 6x5 board? Who wins after:
  . . . . . .
  . . . . . .
  . . ¦ . . .  (Vertical has played a line of length 2)
  . . o . . .
  . . . . . .
