The CF vs computer event was supposed to be watchable on iggc, but the boards were private and will be made viewable only later.  The reason for this was "to prevent comments from spectators during the games." ????  Just filter out the comments in the programming, or delete them later.  Bizarre. 

I couldn't stay awake until 1:00 am pacific to watch the live video feed, and now there's no link to the recorded video either.

It was already a tad boring with Christian playing against robots that he's already demonstrated he can easily beat.  Now that the event is totally unviewable, even in retrospect, it's a complete snoozefest.

Good going, Christian.  All that hype leading up to the event.  What a letdown.
