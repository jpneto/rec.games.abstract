<br><blockquote type=cite>SET has won many awards and is played by millions worldwide.&nbsp; Below is a
<br>brief description of the rules.
<br>
<br>Rules
<br>The object of the game is to identify a 'Set' of three cards from 12 cards
<br>laid out on the table. Each card has a variation of the following four
<br>features:
<br>(A) Color:
<br>Each card is red, green, or purple.
<br>
<br>(B) Symbol:
<br>Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.
<br>
<br>(C) Number:
<br>Each card has one, two, or three symbols.
<br>
<br>(D) Shading: Each card is solid, open, or striped.
<br>
<br>A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on
<br>each card OR is different on each card. That is to say, any feature in the
<br>'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on
<br>each card.
<br>
<br>The Magic Rule
<br>If two are... and one is not, then it is not a 'Set'.
<br>

<br></blockquote>Excellent game.&nbsp; The only problem is that they should make the colors 
more color-blind friendly so that I can play more easily.
