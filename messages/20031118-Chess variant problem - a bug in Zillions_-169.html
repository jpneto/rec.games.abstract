Hi all,

I've used Zillions Of Games to develop a new chess variant, but I have hit a
bizarre problem which suggests a bug in Zillions. When Zillions plays my
game against itself, white wins nearly all of the time in various
symmetrical starting positions. The obvious conclusions were that my game
was flawed or that my rule file was flawed, but the test described below
suggests otherwise.

I have run the start of a game to see which move white picks as its first
move, and I have then stepped back to the start position and used the
richt-click menu to set up a starting position in which <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>black<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> has already
made the equivalent move before white gets to start the game. In effect, I'm
giving black the first move. You would expect black to now have the
advantage, but white still wins nearly every game.

I have examined the code for my game and there is no obvious reason why
white should win regardless of who goes first. The board is 8*8 square. The
starting positions are symmetrical between players (like western Chess), and
each player's starting position has left-right symmetry (unlike western
Chess). All of the pieces have symmetrical move possibilities, including my
"pawns" which can move (or capture) backwards as well as forwards, so I have
not needed the Zillions "symmetry" command to make black's pawns move in the
reverse direction. The only significant mentions of white and black in the
Zillions file are to specify 1) the turn order 2) starting positions and 3)
the "promotion" squares (each player has two "promotion" squares in the far
corners).

Other possibly pertinent details... I'm running Windows 98 on a very slow
PC, with WinMX usually running permanently. I have the players set to 3
minutes per move. The starting positions used are not those specified in the
ZRF file, but have been set up using the right-click menu and saved as a ZSG
file - this is very convenient when you are still experimenting with
starting positions.

There is no checkmateable piece: there are two families of piece in the
game, and each player must retain at least one member of each family. Loss
occurs (in Zillions) after one player's last member of one family has been
captured. (This strange-seeming condition makes a decisive game extremely
likely, and also effectively eliminates the need to resign, since the end is
not inevitable until it's practically reached - there is no equivalent in my
game of KRvK taking a dozen moves to reach its inescapable conclusion. It
also adds massive variety to the end game undreamt of in western Chess.)

Has anyone seen anything like this white-always-wins bug? Thanks.
