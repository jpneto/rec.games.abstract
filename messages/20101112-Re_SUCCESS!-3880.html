Sure about that Bill?  Might want to discuss that with colleague, professor

Hi Mark

I can assure you that whatever's going on in your newsgroup is the

lol, I don't how much longer I can hold out against the likes of Bellowing
Bill and Clodhopper Corey.  And Nick!  Omg, with vitriol like this spewing

I like your games, and I like you, and your pugilism never fails to
entertain

Stop, I can't take it anymore! lol

Oh yeah, commanding performance, Bill.  You really pulled it out of the fire

the department knows you're a degenerate stoner.
