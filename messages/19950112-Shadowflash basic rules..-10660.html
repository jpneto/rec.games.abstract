        Here is an outline of the basics; there were a few clarifications
designed to make the rule hawks happy, but i don't remember them at the
moment.  
        
        Basic concepts of Shadowflash.   
 
           This Stratego variant evolved because I proved that the
original Stratego game failed to strategic flaws inherent in the basic
design of the rules.   (I'm going to assume reasonable familiarity.)
  Under the original 1966 rules, when two pieces of the same rank, such as
two 4's, attack each other, they are both eliminated.  (By the way, both
attacker and defender must declare the value of the respective pieces.) 
Under what I call the "kill the 1 flaw", if both ones are gone, the game
becomes nothing more than a race to see who can munch more pieces, as the
opposing 2's attack anything that moves in the opponent's territory.  
             Under the new Tournament Rules, the situation is reversed. 
By saying the "attacker" wins in equal rank battles, what actually happens
is the defensive player simply holds back and ambushes his opponent's
pieces.  The Silent defender clause only makes the situation worse.  The
game falls apart If instead of trying to win, I play to avoid losing.  
                Shadowflash is my turbo-hyped version to keep some of the
same concepts as the 1966 rules but fix what I found to be the flaw:
random rampages which take advantage of the lack of mobility the pieces
really have.  
          I suggest you use the improvements modularly; they can be added
set by set, to allow you to adjust.  (Indeed, this is the order they
evolved in; please take heed of this suggestion, because both of my two
excellent stratego opponents simply collapsed under the new possibilities.
 )
          All the regular 1966 rules of Stratego apply here; these are
additions and modifications. 
          SET 1: Increased mobility.

       The board is 16 across by 10 deep, with two larger islands.  I will
be using battleship like notation, with letters running horozontal and
numbers ascending away from you.  If you label a1 at your lower left, then
the squares c5, c6, d5, d6, e5, e6 form one island, and squares k5, k6,
l5, l6, m5, m6 form the other island.  
Each player gets the combines use of 3 sets, discarding 2 flags and 3
bombs in the process.  Set the board so that 4 empty rows face you.  Any
combination of these pieces can be used for he opening setup.  On your
turn, instead of moving, you can remove a pieces, including bombs, but
always excepting the flag.  Likewise you can choose to place a piece
anywhere on your 4 "home rows".  (By the way, all 4 rows must be filled to
begin the game.)   
      This way, the "kill the 1" flaw is avoided, as it's very tough to
force all three ones off the board, and any attacked pieces can avoid
rampaging 2's by simply ceasing to be there.

        SET 2: increased information.
        A new procedure called "labels" is introduced.  Whenever a 9
sacrifices itself to discover the identity of a piece, that piece is
permanently flipped over face up for the remainder of the game.  It may be
removed from the board, but must be visible at all times, (say on the edge
of the table).  
       A new piece, called the Phoenix (yes, my own nature inspired this
idea) simply acts like a deathless 9; it attacks and labels enemy pieces,
but has no material value.  (Even a spy can kill it.)  After it attacks,
the piece it ran into is ends up labeled.  (As a hint, a labeled 7 is a
good shield for important pieces.)  
       Whenever a piece LANDS on a square, including the Phoenix, the
person owning that piece chooses to place a color chip on that square.  (4
colors are needed; I have red, yellow, blue, and green chips from a domino
game.) There is a reason for this leter.  At this stage, this makes the
game cheat-proof, AS THE FLAG WILL NEVER STAND ON A COLORED SQUARE!!!!! 
       Also, there is partial wrap-around.  This means you can travel from
a10-a1 in one move, if legal otherwise.  Essentially,  the
a,b,c,g,h,i,j,n,o,p columns wrap vertically, and the 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10
ranks across wrap horozontally.  
  
SET 3:  Increased tactics.  
      Suppose you have green chips on a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 and a6.  If any
moveable piece (not bombs or flags) is on a1, and the rest of the squares
are empty, that piece can go from a1-a6 in one move.  This allows you to
set up "supply lines" to speed up wholesale troop movements.  Suppose that
a7 was blue, yellow, red, or blank.  You can go from a6-a7 as a normal
move, but you could not normally go from a5-a7 in one move, excepting the
procedure outlined below.  
          
         The last procedure is the source of the name: Shadowflashing.
         A 2, a 3, and a 4 can shadowflash.  This means they can move
across PREVIOUSLY COLORED SQUARES of different colors in one move and
convert them to the color of the square they started on.  For example; a 2
has a MAXIMUM shadowflash range of 2, meaning it could move from a6-a8 in
one move, thereby converting a7 and a8 to green squares.  a 3 has a max
shadowflash range of 3, which means it could go from a6-a9 in one move.  A
4 has a max shadowflash range of 4, meaning it could go from a6-a10 at
once.  You are not required to use the full range a piece can 'flash, but
you can not exceed the max range.  
     Defensive procedure requires mixing up the colors, so this procedure
is designed to speed attacks, at the cost of giving the opponent some
information of where the power pieces are.  

          You win if you discover the flag or the opponent forfeits; the
old stalemate rule doesn't apply because you can remove and replace bombs
all day.  Since you can't drop pieces on occupied squares, you opponent
will marshal a few 8's and nuke them, at whick point the flag is the only
piece on the board.  
 
           Hint: Take exceptional care of your 8's.  Trade them for enemy
bombs, BUT DO NOT LOSE THEM FOR NOTHING, as a plus of 3 bombs vs enemy 8's
is a guaranteed win with proper technique.  This is a long game; standard
play time is 8 hours minimum to about 15 hours max.  Therefore, if you
determine your opponent has the technique to convert the win, resign if
your opponent controls 5 or more pieces stronger than anything you have
left, and resign if your opponent has 3 bombs left if you have no 8's. 
These are guaranteed losses, and resigning saves about 5 hours of your
time that can be used to do something else.
