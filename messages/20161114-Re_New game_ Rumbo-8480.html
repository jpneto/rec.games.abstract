Yep. That's what you'll feel when playing the game.

No. It was not my intent anyway to see your game as dance.
But you gave me a wonderful idea of an abstract game based on the concept of the dance steps.
My game has nothing to do at all with your game (no plagiarizing or something similar).
Why did I post a video about rumba dance :
- first : because of the name you gave to your game "Rumbo"
- second : because your game finally looks like if you were looking to avoid plagiarizing my concept of vertical-horizontal. So you used something "complex" with directions which is not in fact helpful for the game-play.
- third : instead of been elegant and inventing a new concept for territory games you choose the worst path. There are many new concepts waiting for game designers to develop them and what crappy designers invent are either recycling of known mechanisms either botched concepts not adapted to the kind of game created.

When you say territory (2D space) the best field coming to mind is geometry (or more complex the topology). You have 10000000 of ideas to derive from those 2 fields. 
A simple game based on dropping stones with geometrical constraints is easy to build. More than that you could imagine a game where a player could trap his opponent forcing him to be unable to respect such constraints.
I can give the solution in less than one hour.
I let you think one week about such concept.
Go to Aops (Art Of Problem Solving) and read some geometrical problems there 
you will be inspired by many problems.

Good luck!
