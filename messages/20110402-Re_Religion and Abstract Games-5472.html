Unlike christians who try to convert people to "save them," athiests
have no reason to convert people other than to save people a little
bit of time they would have spent prolly just sleeping in anyways, so
i never force my athiestic beliefs on people.  But i do applaud it
being used on people who force their religion on to others (no matter
how well intended).  So bravo against that guy!

Also, mark, at the time the bible was written, the learned society
knew with great certanty that the earth was round, and in fact knew
it's circumfrence, it was only the unlearned who thought it was flat
(as they would now if never taught it was round and never sailed the
seas where it is obvious just from sight).  I generally only apply
beliefs on the learned society [note, the unlearned society prolly
didn't know the world was round until education reform happened in the
late 1800's, and nor did they have any reason to know, so they are not
a good mesure of what society believes]
