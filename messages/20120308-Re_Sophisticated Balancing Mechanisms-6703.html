Well, to return to the top of the thread, Ketchup is indeed one of
them because the move protocol and the object provide a continuous
balance by negative feedback, so the opening is no exception.
By the same token, if there is a turn order advantage in Yodd and
Xodd, it's really hard to say who has it.

That's right. The 1-2-2 move protocol is a great balancing mechanism, and, in the case of Yodd and Xodd, it's also essential to the mechanics.

At some point in the past I feared that playing the first move on the center cell would be too powerful in Yodd, but I was obviously wrong, as I soon realized. Experience suggests that well played games should start in the corners, then proceed to the sides, and finally to the center, just as in Go. This is not surprising considering the pseudo-territorial nature of Yodd.

As for my suggested balancing mechanism for Slither, I'd like to make a precision in case it's ever used. It would be simpler and better not to let the first player place any stone on the board on his first turn, but just set the move-komi, after which the second player chooses sides, as in Loose. Komi allows to play optimally right from the start, so it's a waste to have a sub-optimal first stone placed on the board when there's no need for it.
