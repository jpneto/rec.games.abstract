|&gt;   I thought I'd post some results for a game called Slime Trail - invented
|&gt;   (as far as we know) by Bill Taylor. He and I corresponded for a while
|&gt;   re: game trees and strategy for this game, and this is what we came up
|&gt;   with:
|&gt; 
|&gt;   Slimetrail:
|&gt;     played on an NxM rectangle of squares. Each player takes turns moving
|&gt;     a piece around the board. The piece can take one step orthogonally,
|&gt;     and may not re-visit a visited square. Each player tries to move
|&gt;     the piece into his/her goal square. The two goal squares are located
|&gt;     at diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle. The piece starts on
|&gt;     any mutually agreed upon square.
|&gt; 
|&gt;     Note: It doesn't matter which player actually ends up moving the 
|&gt; 	  piece into a goal square; just the fact that it is there means
|&gt; 	  that someone won.
|&gt; 
|&gt;   Normal slime trail:
|&gt;     A first player win exists, starting from any square, provided at least
|&gt;     one of the board dimensions is even. On an odd by odd board, winning
|&gt;     and losing start squares alternate in a checkerboard pattern. A draw is
|&gt;     only possible via cooperation; if one player moves to avoid draws, the
|&gt;     other can never force them. We're still wondering if the winning/losing
|&gt;     start square pattern means there is an easy strategy for this game that
|&gt;     neither of us has seen yet.
|&gt; 
|&gt; etc... 
|&gt; -- 

That sounds fun. I notice that this game falls into my class of
symmetric chess-like games, for which I have a Metaame program which
plays every such game by analysing its rules.  When I have some
time I'll enter this game to the program, and see what it comes up 
with!
