Your unflinching grasp of the obvious never ceases to amaze, Christian.  The
headlines will continue.  Come to think of it, we're overdue for a Tidbits
installment, but  bgg Abstract Games has died down to a trickle.  No
material.  What happened??

I was watching an interview with Charlie Sheen, and he was basically saying
"Man, I'm the shit.  Get the fuck off my ass."  I can relate to that.  Of
course absent in my case are the multi-million dollar paychecks and the drug
fueled porn star parties.  But there is a connection.  The interviewer
sported a shit-eating grin while posing asinine questions such as "Do you
think anyone will hire you after the debacle?"  No, fathead.  Nobody will
hire Charlie Sheen now.  Get your fat fucking head out of your ass.  This
joker was like the Harald Korneliussen of interviewers.  I could see Charlie
Sheen struggling to resist leaping out of his chair and landing a karate
kick on the interviewer's bloated clown head.  Somehow he summoned the
wherewithal to restrain himself.  I learned from Charlie Sheen.
