THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF STANLEY RANDOM CHESS  by GM Gregory Topov



The origins of Stanley Random Chess have been the subject of debate by
scholars for century. In this article from SR Chess Monthly, GM Topov
provides some personal
insights on this controversial subject.


Contrary to popular belief, the origins of Stanley Random Chess (SR Chess)
are in fact evolutionary in nature. Although I am a fierce opponent of
Darwin's theory of evolution and do not for a moment give any credibility to
the absurd notion that the origins of man lie in apes, the same cannot be
said for Stanley Random Chess. Historical records now confirm that the name
of this classic game originates with primates. Irrefutable evidence
supporting this hypothesis has emerged as a result of the ground-breaking
research of Dr. Bill Goldman and Dr. Simon Morgenstern, recently published
in "Uncovering and Exposing the Stanley in Stanley Random Chess" (University
Press, 2001).

Until recently, it was incorrectly supposed that Stanley Random Chess owed
its humble origins to a monkey famously known as "Stanley," who first gained
international prominence as the lowest rated personality in the world-famous
Chessmaster software. He has an ELO of 1, and his moves are entirely random.
This is the Stanley that many uninformed players previously supposed to be
the origin of Stanley Random Chess, but this conclusion is the result of the
mistaken belief that SR Chess is a recent phenomenon and merely a variant of
Simplified SR (Common) Chess. Following concentrated studies of the Stanley
family in early Britain, recent scholarship has become convinced that the
relationship between these two forms of chess is in fact reversed, and that
SR Chess is the original form of the game from which Common Chess developed
as a simplified form of the game. Naturally this eliminates any notion that
the history of SR Chess began with a modern software primate.

Goldman and Morgenstern provide solid evidence that the name "Stanley"
originates with Sir Thomas Stanley (d. 1459), a descendant of William the
Conqueror who excelled in SR Chess from an early age. Recently discovered
ship logs confirm that William the Conqueror's pet monkey, named Stanley,
accompanied him on the ship that arrived at Pevensy Bay on August 28, 1066,
leading up to the Battle of Hastings. Following the success of the Norman
Invasion and William's subsequent coronation, King William's beloved pet
Stanley was known to accompany him on his tour through England. Following
the death of Stanley, William assigned the name as an honorary title to one
of the local families that had proved his strongest ally, from which time
they became known as the Stanley family.

The first mention of the game itself is found in historical accounts of the
Ferrers family in 1137. The Stanley family apparently learned the game of SR
Chess when they assumed the Earl of Derby title from the Ferrers in 1485.
The Stanley family quickly developed a passionate love for SR Chess, and
actively promoted the game, hosting annual tournaments for the Stanley Cup.
In 1892, the Stanley Cup was sadly donated by the rebel Sir Frederick Arthur
Stanley, from which time it was used as a trophy for amateur hockey in
Canada. Frederick T. Stanley, who in 1843 founded The Stanley Works, at that
time a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain,
was responsible for popularizing SR Chess in America. Directors of his
company (now renowned for making fine hand tools and industrial tools) are
still known to play SR Chess in board meetings today.

Until the 20th century, the game was simply known as Stanley Chess. When the
popularity of the simplified form of the game (now known as Simplified SR
Chess, or Common Chess) overtook the traditional form of the game, the
original regulations that strictly governed the sequences and patterns of
the original game (previously common knowledge) gradually were forgotten by
the general chess playing public. To players of Common Chess not familiar
with the body of laws that governed legal patterns and sequences, the unique
play of Stanley Chess appeared obscure and "random", and so the game
acquired the unfortunate designation "Stanley Random Chess" or SR Chess.
Originally intended as an insult, the name has stuck, although it is a
misnomer and SR Chess is certainly not random. The original form of the game
is far more advanced and complex than Simplified SR (Common) Chess, and
experts are agreed that the additional rules that govern move sequences and
patterns lead to more creative and imaginative play than the adulterated and
simplified form of the game that is commonly played around the world today.

Recent times have seen the beginning of an acknowledgement of Common Chess's
origins in SR Chess, and a renewed appreciation for SR Chess. In honour of
William the Conqueror's pet monkey, the original Stanley, software developer
UbiSoft has added a Stanley Random personality to its Chessmaster program,
although this personality is not very competent at the game, and SR Chess
rules are not enforced for human players.

Since its humble beginning, SR Chess has experienced rapid growth and
flourished especially in the late medieval era. But despite an evolutionary
journey of progress from the original Stanley and the Stanley family, the
game is yet to receive the universal recognition it richly deserves. In
particular, the rise of Simplified SR (Common) Chess led to SR Chess seeing
a significant decline in the number of players over the last few centuries.
With the advent of playing opportunities on the internet, there is good
reason today for optimism about renewed growth and appreciation for the
original form of the game.

his influence it has an active presence on the internet, notably the
