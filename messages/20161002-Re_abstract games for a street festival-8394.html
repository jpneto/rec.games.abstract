If you like Slither, I suggest trying some of my own square-board connection games. As a designer, I'm kind of obsessed with them. I've come up with a number of novel solutions to the deadlock problem on that grid, and each of them results in its own connection game, with its own particular set of dynamics.

I'd particularly recommend Cation, my current favorite. I think it will prove to be as interesting as Slither if given the chance. Both games feature an unusually high game length versus board size ratio, but Cation achieves that effect without double moves and with only a limited amount of piece movement (pseudo-movement, really).

My wife Brittany and I played 2 games so far on an 8x8 Akron board.
It's perfect for this event and we'll play it in the future as well.
I'll try to get pics of people playing and post them.

note: playing with marbles in holes makes perfect lines (like snapping to the grid in illustrator).
