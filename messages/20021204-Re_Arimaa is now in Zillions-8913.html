...and I have an online game of Arimaa going on with you, which I sense,
irrespective of the branching factor, that I'm going to lose.  On the other
hand, while Octi is certainly a very neat game, and I can vouch for Don
Green being an exceptionally pleasant person, Arimaa has something Octi can
never get:  Real animal-provided fun.  Having a camel drag a dog into a hole
is, on an entirely subjective and non-provable level, greatly amusing.
Similarly, having a dog push a cat into a trap provides amusement at every
age level, if that's the kind of thing that amuses you.  The despair that
one may feel as the supply of rabbits dwindles is palpable.
    The "neato" factor of Octi is beyond reproach--making a meaningful
stack; adding the key directional control at just the right juncture, etc.
But there's something missing from the appeal of the abstract genius of Octi
for me that you captured with Arimaa.  I know nothing about Havannah, so now
I have to go find out how to play that.
    I know the thrust of Arimaa has been the challenge to the AI development
world, but I think it's a really, really fun game, which for me is much more
important.  I am quite frequently in the minority opinion regarding various
games, but is there anybody following this group who has played Arimaa yet
who disliked it?  I'd be curious to hear why.  True, my only completed games
have been against Zillions, and I have no trouble beating "him", but I don't
think that's fueling my enthusiasm very much.  There are tons of games I
lose consistently that I still love....
