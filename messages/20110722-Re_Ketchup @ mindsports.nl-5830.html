So you have to "play the

happens in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> tense games that go neck and neck to the end.  So
this new subgame comes up only when you're already having a riveting
experience.  That's a perfect time for extra depth to rear it's

But: I reserve the right to be wrong about everything. That's the
delight and frustration of abstract games - they try to hide their
true nature from you.

This ended up in the Ketchup 3.0 thread, but as said there, it's our
own argument, and a good one. And draws would seem extremely unlikely
because with equal snakes cancelling one another out, you'll also come
down to a decision if the players have an unequal number of stones on
the board. And given the placement restriction that may easily, if not
likely, be the case.
