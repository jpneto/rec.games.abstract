Ok, now I'm getting emails on the "co-designer" issue.

The essence of Redstone was using a neutral stone for kills, thereby eliminating ko from Go.  At some point I added in cancerous eyes, i.e. the option to place a cancer stone (what is now a red stone) in one of multiple eyes in an enemy group, because I thought this would improve the architectural integrity of the game, with no thought to quality of play, as usual.

Luis' thoughts on the matter:

"Just remove the whole 'Filling eyes with cancer' section of the rules, so that living groups can't be captured by the opponent before the deadlock. This is even simpler than the original game, and possibly better."

and later:

"Having played only once, I can't tell for sure yet, but my impression is that [the cancerous eye] rule doesn't break the game, which was my main (and vague) concern."

and later:

"Hmm, after having played a couple of games till the very end by myself, I think my initial concerns regarding the eye cancer rule were well-founded, after all."

It turns out Luis was correct in his final evaluation.  The tiny change he suggested had a huge impact on quality of play.  But it wasn't innovation, it wasn't collaboration, and it didn't help me discover a principle which eliminates ko from Go.  It was the equivalent of "Lose the purple tie and you won't look like an ass."

Were it the other way around, I wouldn't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>accept<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a co-designership.  I didn't get where I am in game design riding coattails.
