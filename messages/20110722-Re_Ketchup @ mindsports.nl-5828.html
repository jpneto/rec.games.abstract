Not that it immediately gets rid of any problems (if any), but it has
straight lines as well as 'curly' ones so a 'longest snake' might be
worth looking into.

I've not considered it, but it may be a good idea.  Playing through a
little in my head suggests promise. I'll try it out when next I get a

Maybe it's simpler and more effective to use a normal hexhex board but
to forbid the formation of a compact triangle of one color. In
consequence completing a loop of any size would mean end of story: a
snake killing itself by biting its own tail. A nice (de)tail.

So in it's basic form (taking Morro's rules as a basis)

1. To start, white places a single stone on any empty space.

2. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn, you must place a number of stones equal to the length of the
longest snake on the board. For example, if you the longest snake on
the board is 5 stones, you place 5 stones on your turn.

3. A placement may not result in a compact triangle of three adjacent
like colored stones.

4. When you create a snake longer than any snake created by your
opponent up until that point, you become the leader.
The game ends when no legal placement is possible, and the leading
player at that time wins. The game may also end when one player
resigns.

The 'leader' concept effectively eliminates draws. However, unlike the
'straight row' version, snakes can only connect to like colored snakes
at the endcells, so they never cross or have T-junctions. That's easy
counting if the 'next longest' comes in play (with snakes of equal
lenght). I wouldn't consider the fact that there <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>eventually<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> may be a
draw as very problematic. My feeling is that they would be so rare as
to almost be their own reward.

There are other things to be settled regarding 'pass', for instance:
"The game ends when no legal placement is possible" raises the
question: for whom?
Say my opponent on his turn cannot place a single stone, but he has
the longest snake. In that case I would love to have my turn because I
happen to have legal moves and may even be able to win.
That kind of thing.

P.S. As another 'tie-breaker' one might consider loops (how? I'm not
sure, but I'm pretty sure a version with 'next longest' can do without
one anyway :)
