Here's the beauty of keeping these two objective criteria intact:
They knock out all designer games, all war games, all german games,
Carcasonne, Puerto Rico, Night of Dracula, and every game that has a
stack of shuffled action cards or character cards or whatever kinds of
cards there are.

Not quite.  Atlanteon by Knizia would still qualify (but then the
Euro gamers say it is just a theme pasted onto an abstract).

Antike and a few other games would sneak in too - no random or hidden
information at all.  However they are primarily multi-player games and
I know some would seek to eliminate them too (and I can see the
advantage if you are primarily interesting in tournaments).

That still leaves games where there is randomness in setup but none
in play - for example Caylus or Through The Desert.  Do they qualify 
or don't they?  I guess Caylus be fall by being too thematic but it
could be considered a perfect information game after setup; and if
setup was fixed for tournament play or by players choosing the order
of the six starting tiles in turn a perfect information game without
any reservations.  TTD is a more interesting case.  The theme is thin
enough that one might consider it, the play itself seems related to
other abstract games.  Fixed setups per tournament round could get 
around the random setup issues.

Basically I would agree that the edges are too wibbly-wobbly to come up 
with a reasonable definition that works in all cases.  I am not even
sure it is wise to even attempt it.
