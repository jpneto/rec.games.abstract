Splay is now available at:

I have posted the rules along with an Axiom PC game which allows both
human and computer play.

Greg, let me be the first to congratulate you on a beauty of a game
and a new twist in the relation between the height of a stack and
specific surrounding cells. In most games that feature this
relationship, stack height is linked to the number of adjacent cells
only (Explosion, Explocus, Crossfire, Trounce).

Your implementation is more organic and has a predecessor only in Mu.
Mu it is layered, explosions ('splaying' in your game) blow away the
top layer, then proceed on the bottom layer. A top-layer explosion
let's the layer vanish from the exploding cell and thus lowers the
number of neighbors of adjacent top-layer cells, giving rise to chain
reactions.

That mechanism, splaying affecting the number of vacant neighbours of
adjacent cells, works similarly and wonderfully in Splay. To keep the
reactions balanced, the rule of 'collapsing' stacks that have become
to high to splay is as simple as effective.
A very elegant and solid game, congrats :)
