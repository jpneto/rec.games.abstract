Stanley Random Chess Introduced &amp; Explained for Beginners

Gregory Topov is one of the most famous Grandmasters in Stanley Random Chess
in the modern era. A life-long devotee of the sport, he dominated the game
for the last two decades of the twentieth century. Topov has won a total of
13 world championships, including an unprecedented eight consecutive
victories from 1982-1989. After narrowly missing out on a closely-contested
title early in 2004, he has retired from active competition, but continues
to make an important contribution to the world of Stanley Random Chess by
his writings, sharing insightful analysis and observations. GM Topov was
recently inducted as lifelong member of the I.F.S.R.C. (International
Fraternity for Stanley Random Chess) Hall of Fame. Believing that Stanley
Random Chess is much misunderstood and underappreciated, he is actively
committed to promoting greater awareness about Stanley Random Chess. This
article first appeared in Stanley Random Chess Monthly in June 2004, as part
of a series of articles geared towards explaining the sport for newcomers.

Description

Despite having a long and illustrious history, Stanley Random Chess
(commonly designated SR Chess), is relatively unknown in the modern era due
to the fact that it flourished in exclusive clubs and under the cover of
secret societies. Not to be confused with Fischer Random Chess (FR Chess),
SR Chess has only recently emerged into the modern public arena, where it is
presented as a chess variant. Recent historical studies published by Dr.
Bill Goldman have now offered conclusive proof that in fact the more
commonly played "traditional" chess is merely an inferior and simplified
variant of SR Chess. For this reason common chess is usually designated in
SR Chess circles as Simplified Stanley Random Chess, or Simplified SR Chess.
While superficially similar to Simplified SR (Common) Chess, SR Chess is a
far more advanced and complex game that requires greater skill and
imagination. Unlike the more popular and simplified form of the game, it
relies more on pattern recognition and sequenced moves, offering a
complexity and creativity that is initially perplexing for new players, but
far more rewarding. It relies less on memorization and opening theory, and
leads to more exciting and creative play, with draws being relatively
infrequent.

Objective

Like Simplified SR (Common) Chess, the objective of SR Chess is to win the
game by checkmate. Draws can occur under the same conditions as in
Simplified SR (Common) Chess, but due to the imaginative and more complex
play of an SR Chess game, draws are typically far less frequent, which is
one of the reasons SR Chess is so appealing to players disillusioned with
the number of unsatisfactory draws common in Simplified SR (Common) Chess.
An SR Chess game can also be won by a Forced I.M.R. (Inferior Material
Resignation) after move 30 - see further details under "Rules".

Playing Supplies

Play is conducted in the same manner as Simplified SR (Common) Chess, using
the same chess board and pieces, and with both players moving in turn. Some
variations require the use of two dice, eight territorial square markers,
and a scoresheet, but these are not specialty items. Special Deluxe SR Chess
sets have been known to be marketed separately, but novices should be
forewarned that these merely consist of regular chess playing supplies along
with a set of rules of SR Chess. The rules that accompany Deluxe or Gift SR
Chess sets are typically incomplete, limited to one local variation, and are
not sanctioned by the I.S.R.C.A. (International Stanley Random Chess
Association), and cannot be recommended. During play in tournaments, the
rules are supervised by an official adjudicator or local SRCA
representative. In informal settings without an adjudicator, is not uncommon
for there to be lengthy discussions about rules and strategy. It is rare for
a game to be played in less than an hour, primarily because of the
complexity and creativity the game requires.

Rules

Relation to Simplified SR (Common) Chess

The basic rules of SR Chess are identical to those of Simplified SR (Common)
Chess, so I will not risk redundancy by repeating them in full. Learning
Simplified SR (Common) Chess has proven helpful for some players, since a
knowledge of its legal moves and some basic strategy is essential for good
SR Chess play. However, the simplifications of Simplified SR (Common) Chess
do improverish the traditional game of much beauty and creativity, and can
hinder the development of sound strategy. The difference lies in the fact
that Simplified SR (Common) Chess has eliminated the original rigid code and
rules that govern required move sequences and permissible board patterns of
SR Chess. These are quite complex, and attempting to summarizing them will
only confuse the novice, but new students of the game should familiarize
themselves with the important principles enumerated below.

Random Moves

Newcomers may find the "random" part of Stanley Random Chess rather
confusing. The truth is that the name is an unfortunate misnomer, because SR
Chess is certainly not random. The original name of the game was Stanley
Chess, but the perceived randomness by the numerous fans of Simplified SR
(Common) Chess led to the unfortunate designation Stanley Random Chess.
Players familiar with Simplified SR (Common) Chess typically observe
apparent "randomness" in two respects:
1. Sudden/strange game moves
2. Sudden/strange game termination
What might be perceived as apparent random moves to the newcomer, is in fact
the result of careful and precise play, in conjuction with an elaborate set
of rules that strictly govern legal sequences and patterns. Any notion of
randomness will be eliminated by a correct understanding of:
1. Legal patterns and sequences
2. Winning patterns and sequences.

1. Legal Patterns and Sequences

Legal Moves

Unlike Simplified SR (Common) Chess, the sequence and patterns of possible
moves are strictly regulated by a carefully articulated body of laws, so
that SR Chess has a lesser number of legal moves (approximately half).
Maxwell's "Bipolar Law of Corresponding Necessities" might benefit the
novice:
First Thereom of Permissible Play: "A legal move in Simplified SR (Common)
Chess is nt by necessity legal in SR Chess, but a legal move in SR Chess is
by necessity legal in Simplified SR (Common) Chess."
First Reversed Theorem of Permissible Play: "An illegal move in Simplified
SR (Common) Chess is by necessity illegal in SR Chess, but an illegal move
in SR Chess is not by necessity illegal in Simplified SR (Common) Chess."
The awesome scope of the regulations that govern permissible patterns and
sequences adds an element of complexity and creativity to SR Chess that is
not found in Simplified SR (Common) Chess, and also accounts for the
apparent sudden/strange (random) moves sometimes perceived by novices.

Illegal Moves (Freezing)

Newcomers will notice that simplified captures and retreats are sometimes
deemed illegal in SR Chess. When a move that is legal in Simplified SR
(Common) Chess, but illegal in SR Chess, the piece in question is said to be
"frozen". In some traditions, "frozen" pieces are termed "stone-walled".
"Freezing" of pieces typically occurs when moves are not sequenced according
to the Nubular Rule, or when a Pattern of Unbalance is created. Unfreezing a
piece is possible, but is dependent on the proportion of occupied white
squares relative to occupied dark squares, and subject to the Rule of Double
Diagonals.

2. Winning Patterns and Sequences

Forced I.M.R.

Unlike Simplified SR (Common) Chess, SR Chess has the added dimension that
after the 30th move, the "VollenHauser Sudden Death Principle" comes into
play, enabling players to win the game by a Forced I.M.R. (Inferior Material
Resignation), with the winner being the player with the most material. If
the game has not been concluded at this point, one of the players is usually
quick to create a position that requires a Forced IMR, and so it is unusual
for a game to extend beyond 40 moves. Typically the number of legal moves
increases in the end game, leading to faster and exciting play, greater
attacking possibilities, daring sacrifices, and sudden victories. This also
accounts for the apparent sudden/strange (random) termination of the game
sometimes perceived by novices.

V.H. Conditions

The precise conditions in which a Forced IMR is allowed are too numerous and
complex to enumerate here, and it can take time for novices to develop
strategies to create the right pattern in which such a conclusion is
allowed. A good understanding of the VollenHauser Sudden Death Principle
(usually designated as "VH Conditions") is critical. The classic work by
Leopold Strauss, A Reexamination of Forced Inferior Material Resignations: A
Guide to Winning Play under VollenHauser Conditions (Belgrade Press, 1934),
is the standard reference text on this subject. In tournaments, adjudictors
will normally announce to both players at the conclusion of move 29, "The
game is now under VH Conditions", which means that the VollenHauser Sudden
Death Principle is now in effect. Note that before VH Conditions come into
effect, all sequences and patterns that would lead to a Forced IMR win under
VH Conditions are illegal, to prevent players from establishing an unfair
advantage earlier in the game. The possibility of a sudden win by a Forced
IMR while the game is under VH Conditions leads to very exciting and novel
play, particularly after the 30th move.

Other Rules

The precise rules are far too numerous to list here, and the above rules
merely introduce some of the unique aspects of SR Chess. A good grasp of the
more comprehensive laws that govern legal and winning patterns and sequences
is essential for expert play, but these are amply documented and explained
in Samuel Worthington's fourth edition of the Stanley Random Chess: The
Official Player's Guide - Vol.1 "The Rules" (Vol. 2 "The Players" and Vol. 3
"Developing Winning Strategy" are also worthwhile). The close observation of
expert play is one of the best ways to acquire a good understanding of the
rules.

Variations

To reduce the inevitable perplexity that inevitably confronts the novice
player, it is usual before the game to adopt the house rules of a popular
local variation, such as the International Stanley Random Grand Prix Rules,
or the Modern British Imperial Stanley Random Rules. Over 535 such
variations have been documented by the ISRCA, and the appendix of their 2004
Official Stanley Random Chess Handbook summarizes the 32 more popular
international variations. Due to the development of this wide spectrum of
local variations, novices should not be alarmed to discover that experienced
players typically engage in lengthy and lively debates about the rules and
their variations in the course of a game. Note that the 1983 Genevan
Revision has made it mandatory to obtain an unmoded quadrant (requiring
unweighting of the light squares) for openings in tournament play for all
variations. For novices and informal play it is usually replaced by the
simpler "Gallican Primary Ranking Order" which allows weighted pawn play
within the first ten moves.

Openings

New players will find that openings common to Simplified SR (Common) Chess
may be entirely inadequate, and at times illegal, in SR Chess, and
conversely that many openings which have been refuted in Simplified SR
(Common) Chess may serve well in SR Chess. Consequently novices will do well
to discard most opening theory they have learned from Simplified SR (Common)
Chess. One of the advantages of SR Chess is that opening theory is less
critical, because the creativity and complexity implicit in the multiple
move patterns and sequence formations allows for a greater variety of
openings, and less dependence on pure memorization. While Simplified SR
(Common) Chess has been criticized for being a matter of memorizing
openings, SR Chess relies more on skill, strategy and creativity than
memorization, and once a good grasp of the rules has been obtained,
imaginative young players are able to play at a very high level against
grandmasters. Novice players should be able to grasp the essentials of
common openings (especially the Genevan Gambler Attack, and the Left Wing
Butterfly Defence) in short order by observing other players. It is not
uncommon for a relatively unknown player to emerge from obscurity and
inflict a surprising loss on a well-known grandmaster, as is the case when
the relatively unknown GM Otto Boshnaut first won the 32nd German
Championship in 1885.

Strategy

Although advanced strategy is usually beyond most novice players, Sir
Humphry Footscray has done beginning SR Chess players a wonderful service by
summarizing some helpful principles that serve as an excellent introductory
strategy for beginners:
* Obtaining a material advantage prior to the enforcement of VH Conditions
will increase the likelihood of successfully winning the game by a Forced
IMR.
* Pieces exposed early in the game are vulnerable to attack due to the risk
of "freezing", but they also increase the possibility of early material
gains when attacking patterns are used to take advantage of the opponents
similar vulnerabilities and freezing. (Experienced players usually apply the
Law of Reversed Colours to calculate whether the risk factor is greater than
the piece quotient.)
* A light square imbalance must be avoided to enable the successful launch
of a column attack, in preparation for a win by Forced IMR.
* When the "Rule of Sixes" is adopted (as is common in the modern era,
requiring players to play the first six moves without unmoding the black
squares), bishop moves on white should be avoided due to the risk of
semi-penetration.
* Long diagonals increase the point value of pawns, and are very powerful
when combined with closed pair knight formations.
It is widely agreed that the second of these principles is essential to
master for a good grip of the game. Note that while the Alphabetic Green
Order is a sequence typically used by professional players, it is not
recommended for novices.

History

The name "Stanley Random Chess" is commonly supposed to originate from the
name of a primate featuring prominently in contemporary software, but this
erroneous conclusion is the result of the mistaken belief that SR Chess is a
recent phenomenon and merely a variant of Simplified SR (Common) Chess. The
post-graduate research of Dr. Bill Goldman (doctoral work supervised by the
the late Dr. Simon Morgenstern) has uncovered ground-breaking evidence that
confirms the antiquity and primacy of SR Chess, from which Simplified SR
(Common) Chess later descended, although the latter has enjoyed greater
popularity, and therefore earned the designation "Common" Chess. The name
"Stanley" apparently originates from Sir Thomas Stanley (d. 1459), a
descendant of William the Conqueror who excelled in SR Chess from an early
age, and was also the name of the pet monkey that accompanied William during
his Norman Conquest.

The name Stanley was first bestowed on the family by King William as an
honorary title in memory of his beloved pet. The first mention of the game
is found in historical accounts of the Ferrers family in 1137. The Stanley
family apparently learned the game when they assumed the Earl of Derby title
from the Ferrers in 1485. From this time, they actively promoted SR Chess,
hosting annual tournaments for the Stanley Cup. In 1892, the Stanley Cup was
sadly donated by the rebel Sir Frederick Arthur Stanley, from which time it
was used as a trophy for amateur hockey in Canada. Frederick T. Stanley, who
in 1843 founded The Stanley Works, at that time a bolt and door hardware
manufacturing company located in New Britain, was responsible for
popularizing SR Chess in America. Directors of his company (now renowned for
making fine hand tools and industrial tools) are still known to play SR
Chess in board meetings today. It is entirely coincidental that Stanley is
also the first name of one of the actors that made up the legendary Laurel
and Hardy, although it is conceiveable that his parents named him in honor
of SR Chess.

Popularity

In recent years SR Chess has not enjoyed the recognition it deserves, for
several reasons. Firstly, the complex regulations governing the move
patterns and sequences have been a well-kept secret limited to the circle of
active players, and have largely been communicated by oral tradition.
Secondly, SR Chess literature is highly specialized, and not easily
available to the general public. Thirdly, the game can seem perplexing to
novices, and the general ignorance about the well-established regulations
that define play has led to its strategy being incorrectly perceived by the
uninformed as "random". Fourthly, the Simplified SR (Common) Chess community
has long resisted the notion that SR Chess is a predecessor that predates
the more common and corrupted form of the game. Fifthly, SR Chess enjoyed
its hey-day in private clubs and societies (like the Masons) that did not
encourage public disclosure and advertising of their recreational
activities. Sixthly, the members of the High Board of the ISRCA have
stubbornly maintained traditions which discouraged the active promotion of
the game.

Thankfully, recent times have seen a softening of attitudes among the High
Board, and there is every reason to expect the continued growth and
popularity of SR Chess. It has a growing presence on the internet, and over
950 local clubs are registered with the ISRCA, primarily in Asian countries,
and parts of Eastern Europe. Both the Asian, American, African and European
quadrants of the ISRCA host annual week-long conventions in conjunction with
their SR Chess Quadrant Championship Knock-Out, with the winners travelling
to Poland for a round robin competition for the title of SR Chess World
Champion. Poland also hosts the International SC Chess Olympiad every four
years. The International SR Chess Monthly continues to provide a forum for
the analysis of games by grandmasters, and several other periods devoted to
SR Chess are published by local clubs, particularly in Asia and Eastern
Europe.

Hall of Fame

One of the greatest SR Chess players in history is GM Lord Edward
Humberton-Snapf (1874-1916), whose wife Ivy Rose was a descendent of the
original Stanleys. Humberton-Snapf is regarded as one of the greatest
players of the Victorian era, and his writings on SR Chess are still highly
respected. He was preceded by GM Antonio Pancris of Baden-Baden, who first
entered the global spotlight with a superb performance in the 1822 European
Championship, in which he defeated an Albanian GM with a local offside trap
using the penny formation with both his knights. Lesser known is Russian GM
Victor Seignovich (1909-1931), winner of the national Russian Championship
in 1929. Seignovich was renowned for his blindfolded simultaneous
exhibitions, and was probably the most brilliant player that the SR Chess
world has ever seen, but sadly succumbed to a mental illness while at the
peak of his career. Asian players dominated the game in middle of the
twentieth century. GM Gregory Topov has been the world number #1 ranked
player since the early 1980s, but his recent retirement has seen the
emergence of some excellent young British players since the turn of the 21st
century.

Etiquette

Ever since the Stanley family promoted the game among the English upper
class, SR Chess has traditionally been a gentleman's game. Play is open to
people of every race, religion, culture and gender, provided they agree to
maintain the International Code of Conduct that must be strictly observed.
SR Chess tournaments are generally characterized by the utmost spirit of
courtesy, decorum, and respect. At the discretion of the senior adjudicator,
anything deemed contrary to the spirit of decency and politeness results in
immediate player expulsion, or the forfeit of VH conditions for all
subsequent tournament games. Gambling on the outcome of games is strictly
forbidden. In some local clubs, the International Code of Conduct has been
amended to include local requirements for prescribed dress standards and
acceptable language. In some countries, players are required to dress in
colours that reflect their current international ranking and a coloured belt
that corresponds to their present pattern sequence status.

Literature

Regrettably, reliable SR Chess literature is not readily available, and the
ISRCA has traditionally frowned on mass publications. Most books published
on the subject had a very limited print run, and were distributed only in SR
Chess circles, leading to a very high demand for many titles. The best
introductory work is by Ronald Herbert &amp; Christopher Morley, "Stanley Random
Chess Revisited: A Singular Course in Elementary and Standard Play, with
Critical Observations and Annotations", first published in 1889. This
excellent work was recently reprinted in America, and is available directly
from Gavin Brend, president of the New York SR Chess Club. For the advanced
player, the fifth edition of Kenneth Abrams' "The Modern Expert's Companion
to Stanley Random Chess" (Tokyo, 1979) is essential, although Nikolai
Dementiev's "Stanley Random Chess: Exercises for Experts Illustrated by
Grandmasters" also deserves mention, but is available in only in Russian and
inaccessible to most players. Although it has been out of print for some
time (despite going into sixteen editions), "The Life and Games of Antonio
Pancris: An Annotated Exhibition in Playing SR Chess with Force and Farce"
by Pancris himself is still widely regarded as the best collection of
annotated games. Since most literature on SR Chess is so specialized, new
players are best advised to visit a local club and try to obtain published
materials directly from the ISRCA.

Software

To my knowledge there is no computer program that can play SR Chess
competently, even at the novice level. While the limited number of moves in
Simplified SR (Common) Chess has enabled the rapid advancement of highly
developed chess-playing software, the same cannot be said for SR Chess.
Although SR chess has less legal moves, the countless rules governing
multi-level sequences, patterns and variations give much more room for
creative thinking and imaginative play, and result in a virtually infinite
flexibility that is beyond the scope of current computer technology.
Software developers have experienced a similar problem with the classic
strategy game of Go, although much effort has resulted in Go software that
can play competently at the average level. But the difficulties in creating
satisfactory SR Chess software are presently insurmountable, because merely
determining whether a move is legal can require the consideration of
previous sequences and move patterns (up to eight moves), potential board
patterns, and comparing them with the Legal SR Chess Code adopted in Venice
1893. Discovering the best move is more elusive yet, and although good moves
can be produced by human intuition and imagination, they are outside the
scope of pure calculation. Furthermore, given the huge body of tradition and
regulations for local variations, computer software that is not interfaced
directly with the ISRCA database will always prove inadequate. As part of
the "IBM Stanley Software Solution Quest", IBM is offering a US$35,000
reward for the first software program that can post a winning score in a
four game series against a current grandmaster. But computer technology is
not expected to advance rapidly enough in the next two decades to make SR
Chess software a realistic possibility. Although it is regrettable that no
satisfactory software for SR Chess exists, it underlines the uniqueness and
beauty of SR Chess. SR Chess will remain a game of creativity and
imagination that is played exclusively by humans.

Playing Online

As the result of innovative technology, SR Chess has witnessed an exciting
development following its appearance on the excellent chess server at
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.schemingmind.com">www.schemingmind.com</a>. This development was possible only because the
I.S.R.C.A. came to a contractual agreement with the webmaster that made
provisions for a XML SRC rule parser to control the games. Without this
facility, an array of several hundred servers would be required to host
games on the site. The schemingmind.com server is also equipped with an
automated database filter which can identify the patterns in which a Forced
IMR is allowed once VH conditions come into effect following move 30. The
server is also interfaced directly to the database at the ISRCA to ensure
that only legal moves are entered. The processing time required for this
calculation can take significant time, and this is one of the reasons SR
Chess is played on an email chess server, since real time SR Chess is not
possible with present computer technology.

As an added feature, a special algorithm works with the ISRCA host database
to automatically replace any illegal moves with the nearest equivalent legal
move. This innovative technology is known as the "Stanley Transposed
Automated Replacement" or STAR move. It is the equivalent to the adjustment
that adjudicators can make in official tournament play when an illegal move
is played. Such adjustments or STAR moves are traditionally annotated with
the * symbol, and are also sometime described as "Stanley" moves. Novice
players of SR Chess thus should be prepared to see unexpected transpositions
made to their moves after submission. While this apparent randomness may be
initially perplexing to the beginner, this is an excellent way to make SR
Chess accessible to novices, and enable them to learn the game. Without
requiring a complete grasp on SR Chess rules, novices can begin assimilating
some beginning strategy, and develop some sense of the game. Several expert
SR Chess players frequent the chess server on a regular basis, and are
usually more than willing to explain why attempted moves were illegal, and
offer helpful analysis on play. As a result of this exciting development,
the ISRCA is optimistic that SR Chess is poised to gain further recognition
and increased popularity.

Learning the Game

Since Simplified SR (Common) Chess is in fact a simplified version of SR
Chess, it can be a springboard for progressing to the more advanced game,
and being familiar with its rudiments will certainly enable most players to
make a successful transition to SR Chess, as long as they realize that
clinging to traditional strategy will not be successful. Although a great
deal of good SR Chess relies on intuition and imagination, it is possible to
learn some strategic principles by reading. Unfortunately most good
literature is not readily available, and is usually inaccessible to those
who have not yet attained the master level. The complexities of SR Chess are
best learned in one of two ways:

1. Playing the game

The advance of innovative computer technology has enabled SR Chess to become
accessible for complete beginners to play on an internet chess server. Since
newcomers to SR Chess cannot possibly be expected to be familiar with all
the rules, whenever a player attempts an illegal move, the chess server
schemingmind.com automatically replaces illegal moves with the closest legal
move. This is known as a "Stanley Transposed Automated Replacement" (or a
STAR move), and is made possible by interfacing with the ISRCA database and
using its automated correction algorithm. The STAR move technology enables
games of SR Chess to be played between complete novices who are already
familiar with the rules of Simplified SR (Common) Chess. Since the number of
legal moves in SR Chess is statistically about half that of Simplified SR
(Common) Chess, novices should expect about 50% of STAR moves while trying
to master the basics the game.

2. Observing expert players

One of the best ways to learn the rules of SR Chess is to study annotated
games, or to watch a regular advanced game played by experienced players and
asking them to explain their moves. Regrettably, there is an ancient
tradition that discouraged advanced players from disclosing the nuances
behind expert play, but in modern times it is generally acknowledged that
this tradition needs to be abandoned in the interests of promoting the game.
But novices should be prepared to encounter expert players who will be
reluctant to explain their strategy, or whose complex answers are
comprehensible only to fellow-experts.

Recently the software developer UbiSoft released a version of their popular
Chessmaster software that included a Stanley Random personality. However,
due to an apparent bug in the software and the limitations of current
computer technology, the traditional SR Chess rules are not enforced for the
human player when playing Stanley, making it possible to defeat Stanley
quite rapidly by ignoring the SR Chess conventions and playing Simplified SR
(Common) Chess. This is effectively a form of cheating, by allowing moves
that are illegal in SR Chess. Grandmasters who have the knowledge and the
self-discipline to restrict themselves to moves that are legal in SR Chess
have found that the computer AI can barely play at a novice-level rating
anyway. Playing against the Stanley personality on Chessmaster is not thus
not recommended to introduce novices to SR Chess, because it promotes the
development of strategies that will prove ineffective against humans, and
new players will only be frustrated to find their moves being declared
illegal and replaced with STAR moves when playing against fellow human
players at schemingmind.com. Playing online, and the observation and study
of expert level games remain the best methods to learn SR Chess.

Annotated Games

Studies have proven that the close study of expert level games is one of the
best ways to develop sound SR Chess strategy. Although annotations from
advanced players are usually available only to master level players, but
with the loosening of the restrictions governing the publication of
annotated games, a rare annotated exhibition game is currently in progress
at SchemingMind.com:
