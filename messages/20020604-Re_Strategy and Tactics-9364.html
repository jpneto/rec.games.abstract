Of course you did.  You said exactly: "Computer programs are not
supposed to be able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons."  That's
the statement I disagree with.  It's a statement about what computer
programs can and can't do.

If you didn't really mean it, all you have to do is say so.  Or just say
nothing, when I disagree with it, if you really disagree with it too.

You also keep saying it's the "last time", but then you keep posting
about it.  I don't know why you keep saying you don't have anything more
to add to the thread, and then you keep posting in the thread.
