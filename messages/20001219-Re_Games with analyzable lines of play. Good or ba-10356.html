For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.

In Go, any advice to beginners about the opening, beyond "don't put your
stones next to each other nor very near the edge of the board", is
superfluous.  Studying openings is pointless until you have a fair
understanding of tactics and some understanding of strategy.

Yet weak players buy books on openings, study them, and fail to
understand the meaning behind the moves that we learn.  This does not
improve our game.  It looks as if we do it because we enjoy it, though I
suspect that most of us don't enjoy it.

But, weak players can learn a lot from problem books.  There are many
sources for problems for all areas of the game.  Opening may not be the most
productive, but, it is not as bad as really learning the end game well.

As for me, I learned go in high school, and throughout my seven years in the
navy, I could give almost anyone 9 stones and kick their butt.  My secret
trick play was 3-3 on the 4-4 point.  I had not heard anything about joseki
or read any books.  Well, after 9 years of that, I started work at symbolics
and found a player who was a regular at a go club.  So I went there thinking
I was king of the world.  Well, a 5 dan gave me a extemely unreasonable
amount of handicap, and mopped the floor with me.

At a couple of the clubs was a pro from china, so I went to take some of the
public lessons.  Well, 9 years of well reinforced bad habits were hard to
break.  I was too agressive.  Eventually, I got around 1 dan before time
constraints hit.  Life and death problems I was very strong at, but, that
was mostly reading, it was the big picture that was hard.

I remember when I was around 13, I was at a party, were I saw a book called
reducing territorial frame works.  I spent about 15 minutes with it, then
played a few games with some of the 8 kyu regulars.  Well, they didn't know
how to handle the new moves I picked up. I went up at least three stones in
15 minutes.  within two weeks, I had gone up to 5 kyu.  Not bad.

I knew some other guys who had just picked up the game without any info how
good/bad moves.  Until they met experienced go players, they had been
playing in the center of the board...
