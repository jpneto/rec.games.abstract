: The first game is from third round. The tournament winner Matias Roto beats
: Seppo Ronkko who came second. Time control was 30+30 minutes (analysers, please
: notice!)

Elephant opening versus three-step tiger

: 
: 1.  Ege3   Ece8
: 2.  c5     Hg8
: 3.  g5     Ri9
: 4.  Hc3    c6
: 5.  cx6    Exc6
Red start with Elephant opening (2 headed snake variation) and Black
reply with three-step tiger. First four moves by Black are O.K., but
rather weak exchange of soldiers by Black in #5. Should have sacrifice
the Black soldier for quick development of the Rooks and other major
pieces:
  5  ...     Hd9 followed by  Rc10
Likewise, Red should not keep the soldier if Black played as above.

: 6.  Cg3    Cb7
Apparently, Black did not see 7. g6. Should have played 6. ...  Ece8
followed by Hd9 as suggested above or Rc9
: 7.  g6     He9
: 8.  f6     Cb6
: 9.  Hd5    Hbc8
: 10. Afe2   e6
: 11. Hxb6   Hxb6
: 12. fxe6   Hf7
: 13. e7     He9
Black again wasted two moves. Has Black encountered time pressure here?
: 14. Hf2    Ch7
: 15. Cb5    Cxe7
: 16. Ce5    Ece8
: 17. Hg4    g6
: 18. Hf6    Hc4
: 19. Ce6    g5
Black is doing Red a favour by moving g5 and giving Red the opportunity
to Hh7. Right now, major danger is Black's Horse at e9. 
: 20. Exg5   Hd2
Not sure if both Red and Black are international chess players...?
Apparently, both sides have neglected moving their Rooks in the first 20
moves and content with gaining some material advantage of soldiers. This
tactic would be O.K. if ALL the pieces are active... both players seemed
to have forgotten this cardinal opening theory of chess.
: 21. Hh7    Hg8
: 22. Hxi9   Hxi9
Black did not consolidate its defences in the opening. As a
result, he is one Rook down and the game is as good as over.
: 23. Cd3    Ade9
: 24. Ra2    Hb3
: 25. Ece3   Cxe4
: 26. Rg1    Hc5
: 27. Cd9    Hxe6
: 28. Cxi9   Rd10
: 29. Rg3    Rd4
Last gasp effort by Black to attack. However, Red do not have much
weakness to be exploited.
: 30. a5     Gd10
: 31. Ra1    Hf4
: 32. Rb1    Af8
: 33. Ei3    Ec10
: 34. Vxg10  Ae9
: 35. Ci10   Gd9
: 36. Rg8    Af8
: 37. Rb9+   Gd8
: 38. Rxf8+  Ce8
: 39. Rb8+   Gd9
: 40. Rbxe8  Hg2+
: 41. Rf2    Rg4
: 42. Eeg5   Nf4
: 43. Af3    Rg1+
: 44. ... 1-0
:
In summary, Black lost because of faults in opening theory and maybe
also due to lack of knowledge in Xiangqi's tactical repertoire. I will
post some basic Xiangqi tactics later after I have seen further games
posted here.
