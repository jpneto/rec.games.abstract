That was my idea originally.  Thank Gordon something happened where I don't
have to be in agreement with you on anything now, Kornfuck.  I'm no longer
comfortable with a contestant vote now that one of my fellow contestants has
determined that Monkey Queen should lose.   Without purveying any ill will
toward that contestant, I'd just rather have a judge panel now, even if it's
only Declan.

rofl, Kornfuck you never had a prayer of voting on one of my games.  Not
here in rec.games.abstract.  Even if there had been a public vote, which
there never would have been, not in a contest including my game, you and
Bill Taylor would have been specifically excluded.  You'd know that if you'd
read the discussion, but you haven't.  Buffoons don't read discussions
before interjecting themselves.  That's why they're buffoons.

Idiots like you vote in idiot havens like bgg, Kornfuck.

That's right, Kornfuck.  You won't interfere.  Because you were specifically
uninvited.  Surprised?

I couldn't care less about moronic popularity contests at bgg, Kornfuck. 
That's your scene, not mine.
