The African game of Awari is played with a series of pits in the ground
each containing a number of shells. Players face each other, and the
opening board looks like this:

       Player 2
   3  3  3  3  3  3
0                    0
   3  3  3  3  3  3
       Player 1

The pits at the ends start empty, and they are the "banks". The object
is to have the most shells in your bank at the end of the game. (A
players bank sits to his right.) The game ends when a player is unable
to move. A move consists of picking up <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> of the shells in a pit on
your side of the board, and distributing them one at a time
counterclockwise starting with the "next" pit. (Include the banks.)
There are two special rules: If the last shell lands in your bank you
get to go again. If the last shell lands in a previously empty pit, you
empty that pit and the one across from it into your bank.

I have solved this game. I know there are many others played on this
type of board. It would be interesting if someone could post them.
