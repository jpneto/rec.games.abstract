I did't know that. How could [arimaa] draw?

In the early days of arimaa, if both players lost all their rabbits,
the game ended in a draw, as the main winning condition couldn't be
accomplished. Omar was happy with this, as he felt that a well-
designed game should end in a draw with perfect play. Then he realized
that the possibility of a draw didn't mean perfect play would lead to
it. Moreover, allowing draws was bothersome in tournaments. So Omar
introduced the rule that you also won if you captured all the
opponent's rabbits. At first, the rule was only in effect in
tournaments, while casual games could still end in a draw. Finally,
the rule was made universal.

I understand. A 'back-up goal' is always problematic as a matter of
aesthetics. Take Draughts and many variants. The goal is elimination,
but declaring a blacked position a draw would be disastrous, so
'leaving the opponent without a legal move' becomes a back-up winning
condition. Then a brilliant thought: let's make it the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> winning
condition because hey, it includes elimination! We'll have <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> goal
again!
Yes, quite.

But it's not quite the same is it? There's an <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>order<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> in themes and
'leaving the opponent without a legal move' is about as unspirited as
it gets. At the same time it's the most common back-up goal.

In Chess stalemate is a draw because 'leaving the opponent without a
legal move' lacks style. So do those who advocate it to be a win.
In Emergo you win <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> by elimination. The game can afford to make a
blocked position a draw.

In some Chess variants you're not explicitly forbidden to move into
check - you're captured and lose. These variants abandon 'checkmate'
as a theme, replacing it by 'capturing the king'.
In Shakti you may not move into check, but your turn just passes back
to the opponent if you can't move.
Small concessions to style.

So I can understand Omar's reluctance. At the same time, adding an
'elimination' back-up goal to a race game isn't all that illogical -
to run at all, you gotta be there.

Omar had to salvage [arimaa] with the world's ugliest rule, superko.

That's not what I meant. In fact, the superko rule (ugly as it is) has
always been applied in arimaa.

Given the nature of a large percentage of gametrees (chess type,
draughts type, some territorial or connection type), there's a general
concensus (Mark excluded because these games shouldn't exist in the
first place!) that 'repetition of positions' must be addressed, one
way or the other.
So there you are. Nothing ugly about it except if you implement it in
an ugly way.
