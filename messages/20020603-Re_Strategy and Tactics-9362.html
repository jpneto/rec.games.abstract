No there doesn't and the point is irrelevant anyway.  If and when
something happens for the first time, such a statement of surprise
would be any normal person's reaction.

I think definitely not.  This is in fact exactly the misconception that
cost Kasparov the match against Deep Blue.

I corrected you once before on this point; the situation referred to
occurred in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>PREVIOUS<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> match that Kasparov won.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Your statement is a non sequitur.  What I said is exactly true: your
statement is wrong, your attitude toward "surprising" moves by computers
is wrong, it's the same misconception that Kasparov had, and it caused
him huge problems in his subsequent match.

If you simply have something you want to say on a similar topic,
then I would appreciate it if you would start a new thread

No.  But you're welcome to follow through on your claim that you will
stop arguing.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The only point I made was in response to a general definition of
strategy and tactics.  I pointed out that while it was a reasonable
general definition, that it was difficult to impossible to make a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>precise<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> definition.  Not once have you addressed my point.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's not the only point you made.  You made the specific claim:
"Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make sacrifices for
strategic reasons."  Those are your very words.  According to you, this
is a fundamental limitation of computer programs.  And I think you're
wrong.
