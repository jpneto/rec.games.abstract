I have a little doubt about the rule allowing only one bridge to be
placed when a move to a square permits more than one.  Might this lead
to situations where a critical bridge can never be built, possibly
even leading to draws?

And I don't especially like the name Bloctagons, partly because there
is an existing, closely related game by Wayne Schmittberger called
Octagons.  But also becuase it has an ugly ring to my ear.  But that's
highly subjective.

Otherwise, as a fan of connection games, I think you have something
interesting here.

Hey fizzy,

I'm fairly certain that a draw is not possible mostly because there is
never an intersection of more than 3 lines, but if you find one then
let me know.

About the bridges:  Having bridges which can connect to each other
makes them significantly stronger than the octagons.  On the other
hand what's nice about this version is that since the squares are
seemingly pretty strong because they can split an octagon's connection
you can force someone to play a bridge which then puts a limit on
further bridge play in that area.

About the name:  I think the naming of this game has been the most
annoying part of the whole thing.  For me it's really hard to come up
with a good name.  I called it Octess because it's kind of an
octagonal tessellation.  It's more specifically truncated square
tiling I guess, but then after playing it I didn't feel like Octess
captured the game play as much as it described the board which I find
kind of secondary while playing.  My friends at home call it 'cock
block' which I find pretty funny but I chose that not to be the
official name for obvious reasons :).  Blocking Octagons seemed a
pretty key feature in the game and it has 2 os in it which can be
'blocked' ( ø ø ) so yeah... those are my reasons for naming it that.
I'm open to suggestions, but not really thrilled to change it again.

Daniel
