<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>I try to reach richardï¿½s pbemserver for several days, but no response, no 
emails, website is down. 

<br>Who knows more?
<br>
<br>my userid there is "Jeroen" and that is also my firstname.

<br>Yes, it's down for the moment (depending on your definition of "moment")
<br>
<br>I was attempting to do an upgrade this weekend, and all sorts of things
<br>went wrong.&nbsp; I've got the machine booting again (and NO data was lost), but
<br>I've still not had a chance to complete the upgrade.&nbsp; I hope to have service
<br>restored sometime late tonight.
<br>
<br>Sadly, real-life keeps interfering.&nbsp; Daughter broke her arm Sunday night (with 
all the requisite ER and doctor visits).&nbsp; New hardware was needed (after 
fighting with it for 2 days... a new hard drive made it bootable).&nbsp; Of course
<br>there was no place in the case to MOUNT said hard drive.&nbsp; So I had to do some
<br>machine transplantation (had another case that had the room for it).&nbsp; And that 
whole "day job" thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; ugh!&nbsp;&nbsp; And even when I'm home, I can't start putzing 
with it until the twins are abed...
