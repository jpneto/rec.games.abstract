That's an interesting thought. Had I been interested in FIDE rules
at the time I suspect that I would not have liked the change, and
as it turns out, FIDE ended up not liking it either.

I'm surprised to hear that. I would tend to have thought that, if it
was theoretically possible to win in a certain position, and only the
50-move rule was standing between you and the win, then, since the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>intent<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the 50-move rule was, presumably, only to force a draw
where players would otherwise be endlessly moving aimlessly... this is
a change most Chess players would have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>demanded<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> if FIDE had shown no
interest in making it.

For those who don't know what we are talking about, a recap:

 In the FIDE Laws of Chess, published in 1984 and 1988, the 50-move
 rule was extended to 75 moves for the following positions:

 King + Rook + Bishop against King + Rook;
 King + 2 Knights against King + pawn;
 King + Queen + pawn one square from promotion against King + Queen;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Knights;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Bishops;
 King + 2 Bishops against King + Knight

 In 1992 during the FIDE Congress in Manila the Rules Committee
 suggested establishing one rule for all endings: 50 moves, and
 the General Assembly of FIDE approved the change.  In 1996 the
 Congress in Yerevan revisited the decision and kept the 1992
 rules.  There are currently no exceptions to the 50-move rule.

Ah, I haven't been keeping up. But then, human chess players are not
computers, so perhaps the need for the extensions wasn't real. My
inclination would have been to make it a 75-move rule if simplicity
and uniformity were desired. I had thought that the computer studies
had led to a need for up to about 250 moves in some positions, not
merely 75, however.

Even after narrowing down
the search to "Standard American Checkers" (look at all the regional
variations at [<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts</a>], most of
which appear to be recognized at [<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.fmjd.org/site.php">http://www.fmjd.org/site.php</a>]! ),
I can't seem to find the random opening rule.

It isn't described in full in too many places on the web, no.

Elsewhere on this site - look under Openings - is the only listing of
the current three-move restriction on the web, and elsewhere, under
the history of the game, the previous two-move restriction and the
older version of the three-move restriction with 137, rather than 144
or 156, possibilities is given. You have to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>dig<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, though, to get that

If Chess players worldwide recognize that Chess has problems similar
in magnitude, then for the existing Chess federations to get directly
involved with experimentation with Chess variants in an attempt to
find a solution to the problems would be a legitimate activity. I'm
dubious that the problems are, yet, that serious, and that a Chess
variant would be effective in addressing them, but in principle this
can be as legitimate in the Chess world as it was in the Checkers
world.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That makes sense.  Let us hope that the FIDE and USCF are run by
same people when that day comes...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Incidentally, the fact that the 137 possibilities in Checkers were
increased to 144 - and then, on August 2003, increased to 156, with
the description on the page implying that these three-move sequences,
formerly thought to be dead losses for one player, were now shown to
be drawable (but not winnable) with really good play... and this was
why they were added to the list... leads me to the conclusion that
Checkers must still be in deep trouble, since they're scraping the
bottom of the barrel. (Perhaps they'll be going to a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>four<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>-move
restriction soon, and maybe that will allow them to stick with more
balanced move sequences...)

However, the history of Checkers on that site gives reason for
optimism about Chess. The two-move restriction was originally adopted
because of a 40-game match in 1863... in which, in 21 of the 40 games
played, *the same entire game of Checkers was played from beginning to
end*.

Chess is nowhere near being analyzed to the extent that would lead to
embarassing phenomena like that.
