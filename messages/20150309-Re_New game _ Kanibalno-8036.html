Hmmm.  Well, maybe your game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> 4D if you can move from 3D board to 3D board.

"Taming The Slippery King

Page 116 Variant Chess 61 July 2009
Review by John Beasley, editor

A fundamental difficulty in multidimensional chess is that of confining and mating the king. Joe Joyce's fourdimensional Hyperchess [Joyce] uses a method which appears novel."

Nice.  

About 1/3 of my abstract games (excluding connection games) are inherently adaptable to any number of dimensions, without any modification to the rules, by virtue of their simplicity.  Monkey Queen is one.  You'd only need to specify board size and starting position.

Many are adaptable to other dimensions. That is obvious. What is hard is to find the optimal dimension. When I say optimal I mean to use one criterion : the playgame will be more or less interesting with k dimension? yes or no.
Some games are not interesting at all if you change the dimension. Worse than that some are unplayable in some dimensions.
The human player is not a machine or robot. 
There is an optimal number of choices to be made for the human players.
There is an optimal number of moves that a human being could handle. The more you multiply those levels the less the game will be playable except if the game is digitalized so the human brain will focus on creativity not on complex intricacies.
Do not forget that games are created for the average human not the geniuses..
Otherwise the game will be played only by 2 or 3 people.
Now there are some specific fields in mathematics that only 4 or 5 persons in THE WORLD could understand!!! 
4 dimensions?????????????????? why not 1000000 ???
It seems to me that some game designers are just trying to hide their incompetency behind UNSUSEFUL complexity.
An interesting abstract game is a game challenging an average human brain not a computer. At each step the player has to solve some sort of puzzle having a unique solution or few solutions reachable in short time of thinking.
