Hello,

i recently found out about Gomullo, a crossover between Gomuku and
Othello.

Rules:

- starting position as in Othello
- board as in Othello
- pieces as in Othello
- moves as in Othello
- the goal is to connect two opposite edges of the board or two diagonally
  opposite corners of the board with a straight line of your pieces
  -- that is --
  making n-in-a-row on a n-sized board


I was rather afraid that this game would be rather drawish, but it didn't
appear to be true. However, i am a LOUSY Othello-player. What do you think
of the game? Will it be drawish when played by expert players?

Panther
