I'm not in denial and there's nothing psychopathic about my design
process.  Man, put down the psychiatry text and go take a walk in the
sunshine.

2010 is the year of the fan.  I.e. MSG fans are a little more
outspoken now.  The 17 years before that were not the year of the
fan.  The tiny fan base who now "get it" is appreciated, but if I made
it 17 years without positive feedback, obviously I don't thrive on
reassurance.

I try to design simple, architecturally interesting, draw free games.
Period.  If this translates into "autistic design principles" in Corey
Clark world, a world in which everyone forces Corey Clark to design
bad games, then so be it.  But please stop plastering the group with
your psychiatric nonsense.  You're not a psychiatrist.
