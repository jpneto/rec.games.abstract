White has a group of 6 and black has a single stone which is 4 spaces
away.  Normally this would be too short of a distance to strike the
white group for black.
WIth the new rule black's other pieces come into play.  If where black
lands is also next to a group of 2 other black stones or if it's next
to 2 single black stones then the strike value would become exactly 6,
thus giving black a chance to strike from a closer range.

The non-striking black stones which increase the strike values are

I agree, and I did understand that correctly. My point was: if the
black stone ends up next to two different white groups. Say it could
slip in between a 3 and a 4 group (leaving out the 'helper stone or -
group' for the moment, for clarity).
Which of these two groups determines the striking distance?

either.

yes

I'd consider allowing that, otherwise the mechanism would hamper
itself, which is mostly an indication that something is wrong.

Christian Freeling is hurling mud in a completely unjustified manner, 
this time by making use of technical medical terms he is just 
unqualified to make. Ignore it, and pity him for stooping so low. For 
all his apparent skill at inventing games, to do this in the midst of 
trying to answer an open and question (posed by yourself) merely 
devalues his contributions.

For the record, Bill Taylor is also interested in abstract games. He 
appears to have once said something that offended Christian Freeling at 
some point, possibly just after Christian Freeling thought he was being 
snubbed when no one answered a post of his in another group I will 
mention later, and publically left the group and made a number of 
disparaging comments about the group he left on this group. Since then 
one can hardly escape the snide attacks upon him and Corey Clark (the 
other major user of this other group) by both Christian Freeling and 
Mark Steere. The entire episodes diminish anyone involved in the mud-
slinging exchanges, and, unfortunately, it seems to be spreading in the 
way you have just experienced.

I strongly advise you to make use of another forum, possibly in addition 
to this one, on google groups, named recre.games.combinatorial There 
seems to be an absence of bile and insult on that forum.
