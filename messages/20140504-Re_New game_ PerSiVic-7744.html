Seems interesting! Some comments:

You'd need to specify what happens when a player has no available moves on his turn (and, depending on how you address this, what happens if the opponent can't move, either).

If I were to play the game (which I'll try to do), I'd probably want to try the following house rules to make the game drawless:

a) When both players have less than 5 stones each on the board, the game is won by whoever places on his last row a number of stones equal to the number of stones of the player with more stones.

b) On every turn, at least one stone must end its move one or more squares closer to the last row than it was before the move, except when making a capture.

c) If a player doesn't have any move available on his turn, he must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.

d) If both players pass in succession, whoever passed last wins.
