Now, reflecting on it again, I really think that rule would create the
potential for infinite cycles.  What happens is, you move a baby away from
the enemy queen to block a check, but also place the enemy queen in check by
doing so.  Then an enemy baby moves farther away from your queen to block
that while also placing your queen in check.  So here you have babies of
both colors moving in the wrong directions and then they can trickle back to
their original positions, I believe.  I haven't tried to find an actual
cycle example, but I'm pretty sure it could happen if I added that rule.  So
I won't be adding that rule.
