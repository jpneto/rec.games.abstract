Hi, Omar...

Hi Don,

Is it true that OCTI was designed to be difficult for
computers to play? 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes.  That was the idea back in 1998, back in the dark days after
Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue.  I had the notion that it would be an
interesting challenge to devise a game that was simpler than chess
(not a hard criterion to satisfy) yet more resistant to computer
analysis.  My idea was that a game in which players constructed their
own pieces and continually chose whether to improve or move them might
do the trick.  The jury, of course, is still out.

If so, has there been any official
match between the best program from the yearly competition
and the best human player to see where the programs
stand now compared to humans?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

At the end of each year's Octi Robot Tourney, I play the winning robot
in the standard version of Octi (where players strive to capture all
three enemy bases).  That's sort of the "money" game between robots
and humans -- although I really can't claim to be the best human
player.  (For these games, see the archive at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a>).  Although
the winning robots play the mini versions of Octi well (they are darn
good at the 6x7 version and not bad at the one-base version), they are
not competitive at the standard version.  They will improve, of
course, and that's what makes the tourney fun.

You have given me the idea that we should formalize a human vs. robot
competition, just for fun.

Cheers,
Don
