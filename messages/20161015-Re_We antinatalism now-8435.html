No one is dumbest than you.
I could register in bgg forum today if I wish to.
But this forum makes me vomit each time I connect to it.
As soon as I post any game doggy people ("les chiens de garde" in french) run to prevent the moderator that I`m here. Shortly after the mafia start its "provocations". As I could not resist to tell them what I think about them forcibly the cycle start. I`m no longer able to post before one week or so. Then 6 months. Then ban! 
The mafia is organized with its godfathers (Ayatollahs). The Ayatollahs of the site launch a "fetwa" : Hazen must be banned otherwise anyone here who support him will be banned too.
Fortunately not all the forums are squatted by a mafia-like group.
Through your personal insults you show clearly who you are.
One day you will surely finish behind bars because you are ignorant when it comes to laws.
