Together with two colleagues here at Beloit College, I am trying 
to trace the origin of the solitaire game "Tchuka Ruma," mentioned by 
Joseph DeGrazia in Math Is Fun (1949), who refers to it as 
being of "East Indian" origin. Bell and Cornelius describe it in 
their <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Board Games of the World<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, as do Averbach and Chein 
in their _Mathematics: Problem Solving Through Recreational 
Mathematics_. Both pairs cite Degrazia but give no further 
provenience. However, Averbach and Chein mention a game 
"Ruma" in a way that suggests that it might be (or have been) a 
commercially marketed game.

Tchuka Ruma is one of very few <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>solitaire<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> versions of mancala. 
Apart from a non-game pastime from Nigeria (Ise-Ozin-Egbe, 
described by Bell and Cornelius), it may be the only solitaire 
version of mancala to have arisen in folk culture; Larry Russ, 
author of Mancala Games, does not know of any others. Hence 
we are strongly interested in tracing its cultural source. We 
have made some progress through consulting Indonesian 
students and colleagues and some anthropological sources. 
We have not yet found any source that details the rules that 
Degrazia gives.

In Tchuka Ruma, the player in effect uses one row of a two-row 
mancala board, with a special last hole (the rumah, which 
means "house" in Indonesian). The game begins with each 
hole (except the rumah) holding the same number of stones. 
Play begins with the player selecting a non-rumah hole, 
picking up all of the stones in it, and sowing them around the 
board, one to a hole, as far as they go. If there are enough 
stones, sowing continues into and even past the rumah, into 
the first hole in the row, as if the row were a circle. If a sowing 
ends in the rumah, the player chooses any other nonempty 
hole to sow from. If a sowing ends in a non-rumah hole with 
stones in it, the player picks up the stones, leaves one in the 
hole, and continues sowing. The object is to get all of the 
stones into the rumah. The player loses if a sowing ends in an 
empty cup.

The game turns out to have very interesting and tantalizing 
mathematics associated with it, which we are continuing to 
explore. The most basic question is, for what number of stones 
per hole, and what number of holes, can the player win?

I am writing to ask readers if they know anything further about 
�the provenience of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>solitaire<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> versions of Tchuka Ruma
�other <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>solitaire<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> games of mancala type
�commercial versions of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>solitaire<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> games of mancala type (e.g., 
with the name "Ruma")

I will appreciate any replies.
