I haven't played Hnefatafl more than once or twice, but when I did, I
noticed some similarities with the old Avalon Hill wargame "Caesar at
Alesia": In both games one side has to bring the leader piece from the
middle of the board to the edge, and the other side has to capture the
leader.  Also, the "two-to-one surrounded" automatic victory rule from
"Caesar at Alesia" is very similar to the capture rule in Hnefatafl.

I don't know the game but by your description I'd say definitely yes. If
the starting position is similar then it is the same game as that covers
the defining features of the tables (hnefatafl) games.

The main reason I'm unsure about the inspiration is that CaA is a
seventies-style simulation game using a hexmap, combat tables, terrain
rules for movement and combat, etc., amounting to a 10+ page rulebook.
So in that sense it is very different from the simple Hnefatafl.  It
is only in theme and the peculiar surround rule that they are alike.
But whether these are directly inspired by Hnefatafl or came out as a
consequence of the game subject, I can't tell for sure.
