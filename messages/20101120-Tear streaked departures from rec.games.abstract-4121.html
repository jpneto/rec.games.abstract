Bill Taylor and Corey Clark both seem to be in denial about their recent
tear-streaked departures from rec.games.abstract, that lasted two days and a
half hour, respectively.  Here's a recap so the rec.games.abstract
readership can judge for themselves.

Bill Taylor's tear streaked departure from a few days ago:
===================================================
To all those great many who have privately replied expressing support,
offers of help, and disgust at Mark Steere's despicable (but laughable)
attempts to get me into trouble, MANY THANKS.

Your good wishes are very welcome.  You will also be pleased to hear that
Mark's complaints have been investigated and found to be baseless, and that
I have been declared free of blame.  As I predicted, he has confirmed his
status as a vicious crackpot.  His penchant for posting private emails to
him, on the net, has also been noted.

You could further show support, by cut-&amp;-pasting and reposting my message
about the new group, every so often,
say once a fortnight, a different person each time, so bilious Mark can't
really make a personal attack on you
via whatever server you have.

Many thanks once again, your messages sing out hope for Usenet after all!

Bill

Corey Clark's tear streaked departure from a few days ago:
===================================================
Great, now we have our own personal David Icke! Really Christian it's time
to close the book on this high school science project of yours.   Did you
test the PH levels of rec.bile.insult? Their off the map!!!  But really what
the fuck are you talking about? Mediocrity!  Rec.bile.insult is mediocre, at
best. No, there's no post too stupid, inane, pointless or absurd for RBI.
Now that's mediocre. I mean  You old guys in your ivory towers! It's
hilarious what you come up with.  Equating respect with mediocrity is just
so unbelievably dopey. I should just drop Bill Taylor like a hot potato
before we incur anymore collateral damage. Would that make you happy
Christian? I guess Nick Bentley's pretty mediocre too, he doesn't have
dozens of games either.  Okay so he's out. Oh and of course, how could I be
so stupid, myself!  I'm the one hit wonder! All I did in my life is make
Particle Bond! Oh woe is me... Okay cya internet, it's been fun!
===================================================

And yet here they both still are.
