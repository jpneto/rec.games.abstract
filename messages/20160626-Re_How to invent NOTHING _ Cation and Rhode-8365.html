If you play 100 games of Cation be sure that the first player (black) will be winner in at least 80 games.

The pie rule is used. However, the game should be more balanced than Hex on a board of the same size, simply because it lasts more moves.

Even the example given by Luis in 4x4 grid is a staged one! 
Are you dumb to accept a perfect play with systematically one unique move per turn? What about moves equally perfect (2 or more)?

The perfect play example was generated by a computer program trying to win as both sides as quickly as possible. Between two moves that lead to a loss, the one that delays it for longer is preferred. So there can be other equally long perfect play sequences, but shorter sequences are not perfect play by this definition.

So what?  more moves means more balanced game????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is your way of reasoning? DUMBNESS!!! 
How can you design a game?
I`m not impressed by "generated by a computer program". There are 100000000 of wrong programs turning even when a programmer is a professional one.
How could you be sure that it is a "perfect play". What is the meaning of perfect play? Even if you explore an exhaustive tree there are nodes or roots having the same value. Why are giving a unique solution with unique moves? 
Mister Luis you are simply either lying either ignorant or both.
Cation is flawed game. The black will always force a win.
