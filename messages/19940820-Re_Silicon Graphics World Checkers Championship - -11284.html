I disagree.  Dr. Tinsley was quite correct to resign the match, though it
was certainly very sad that he could not continue it.  Any match rules I've
ever heard of stipulate showing up for scheduled games, and allow a certain
number of postponements.  Too bad, but there it is. 

I think accusing the Chinook lot of poor sportsmanship is out of line.

----------------

I just caught onto this story, so if I'm misinformed then I'll
retract this but I must say that my first reaction is that
indeed the Chinook team deserves to be accused of poor sportsmanship.
I think it's perfectly honorable for Tinsley to offer his resignation
but the Chinook team should have refused to accept it and instead
arranged for the match to be held at a future date.

Tinsley showed immense sportsmanship in ever agreeing to play Chinook
in the first place and certainly he exhibited supreme sportsmanship
(if not quixotic behavior) by agreeing to terms that favored the machine
(i.e. where fatigue played a role on the human and not the machine).
For the Chinook team to accept this resignation is absurd.
I, for one, would rather have my dignity and honour (as well as 
my self-respect) than to accept a resignation on such terms.
Of course, Chinook has no culpability - it's a machine after all, but
the team of humans who are behind it should be ashamed of themselves.
They've gained a title but lost my respect (and I'm sure I'm not 
alone).
