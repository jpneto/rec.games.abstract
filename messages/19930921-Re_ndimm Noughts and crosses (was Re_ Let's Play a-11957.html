For D=3, N=4 the first player can force a win. Regrettably I cannot
describe what a precise winning plan is here, but here's the general
idea:

* Start in one of the corner cells. (You could also implement this plan
  in the central cells; they are isomorphic to the corner cells.)
* Continue to play in the corner cells for the first four moves, generally
  avoiding your opponent's blocks. Try to establish one of these patterns:

   X...    ....    ....    X...           X...    ....    ....    X..X
   ....    ....    ....    ....    OR     ....    ....    ....    ....
   ....    ....    ....    ....           ....    ....    ....    ....
   X..X    ....    ....    ....           ....    ....    ....    X...

* Be aware that if on your move there is some 4x4 planar cross-section of
  the board which contains 3 of your tokens but is otherwise blank, you
  can usually force a win in that plane. You may have to deviate from the
  above plan in order to block such a threat from your opponent. Generally
  the best blocking move is one which deprives one of the rows which goes
  "in 3 dimensions" from one corner to its opposite from your opponent.
* After making 4 or 5 such moves, you should have a forced win, meaning a
  sequence of immediate threats culminating in an unavoidable double threat.

For D=4, N=4 again the first player can win by essentially sticking to the
above plan for 3 dimensions. Actually, I strongly suspect the first player
always wins whenever N=D. John Conway's book "Winning Ways For Your
Mathematical Plays" probably covers this territory; if your local library
has it you might want to check it out. (Perhaps I should take my own advice!)

Whenever N is odd the game is not very interesting, because the first player
gets a huge advantage by playing in the center cell, unless D is so low
that it's easy for the 2nd player to draw. One variant that seems intriguing
is D=3, N=6, object is to get 5 in a row instead of 6. Overlines, or getting
6 in a row, also win. This would be a blow-off for the first player without
the following ritual (taken from a suggestion in Games magazine): One player
places two Xs and one O on an otherwise empty board, producing a position
with O to move. As an alternative, perhaps only one X could be placed.
The other player then decides which side to play. Play proceeds from this
position. Someday I hope to write a program to play this game.
