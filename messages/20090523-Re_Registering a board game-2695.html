One thing I forgot: There is one thing you may want to do:
 Mail it to yourself in a sealed envelope (you possibly
have to use a special form of postal shipment, I don't know what it's
called in English). This would not let you sue anyone successfully,
but it would at least spare you some headaches if some self-important
would-be designer is stupid enough to try to sue <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. Since
reinventions happen all the time, this is not quite as unlikely as it
sounds.

one of the quirks of the internet is the vast amount of duplicate
information around the globe, including archives of all the usenet
groups.  the usenet postings are timestamped.  a post here in this
group is thus archived on many computers around the world with a
timestamp local to the machine - all within minutes of each other.  to
be able to forge the timestamp, you would have to find all those
computers and make a clandestine hack into them.  i'm not sure this
can be done.  in a certain way, publishing on the internet is a very
iron-clad method of documenting the creation of intellectual
property.  however, the legal beagles havent (to my knowledge anyway)
given this line of thought any attention.
