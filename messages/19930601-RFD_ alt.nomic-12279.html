The Nomic World MUD is closing down tomorrow, and many of the players
are looking for somewhere to continue playing. In the absence of another
site to run the MUD, we are thinking of moving to a moderated newsgroup.

This is a RFD for the newsgroup alt.nomic - a moderated newsgroup
setup up for playing a game of Nomic, the game of self-reference designed
by Peter Suber. I have decided to make the newsgroup moderated, initially
acting as moderator myself, in an attempt to keep the noise-to-game ratio
low. Perhaps a non-moderated alt.nomic.d is also in order.

Now, I'm fairly sure I can newgroup these two groups myself, but I'd
rather be certain. The last thing I want to do is stuff up the creation
and bring down the wrath of the net.gods. Can anyone point me towards
the definitive work on the subject?
