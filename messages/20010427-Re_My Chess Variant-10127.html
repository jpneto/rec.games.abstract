Hi, what is your design goal?  I first thought it might have been

Hi William,

well, I must admit that my first goal was only to produce an original game
concept... I have a fair knowledge of abstract strategy games, and I never
encountered a game in which the usual sequence of move: "choose a piece,
move that piece" is inverted.

Then, I encountered the problem that Queens were too powerful: a Queens
always chosen and moved in the opposite camp was an havoc. So the rule
"never choose a piece twice" was a fair fix.

I did not played the game extensively, I did some games against Zillions
(thanks, Stephen!)... the resulting game dynamic is not astonishing, but
sometimes I found some interesting situations...

bye,
G.
