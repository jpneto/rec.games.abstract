If you were playing against the machine I'd say that's fair comment for the
first period of the game - the AI isn't
advanced and is designed to let you learn the game gently.  The game,
however, can be played very aggressively from the start (you could pincer an
opponent's piece within 7 moves) - some people prefer to build and hope to
win by building faster and taking more tiles, others like to attack pieces.

Ouch .   Can I suggest you try playing back one of the longer games (which
are all between people, rather than using the AI) e.g. (choose "watch a past
game" from the home page and say 2003-11-22  19:19 - which had 61 moves)
where there is plenty of interaction, with the threat of pincers and
connection moves leading to a high degree of interaction, even though the
game ends by red achieving 42 tiles.   As regards Amazons comparison ... no
piece in Pacru can ever be considered permanently blocked - tiles can be
given up to reorientate the piece, and connections, border transformations
and meetings can all be used to get extra tiles in an area where a piece is
temporarily blocked due to a low power of movement.  On first play players
can feel "stuck" but there are lots of ways of getting unstuck and Pacru
ends up a surprisingly fluid game.
