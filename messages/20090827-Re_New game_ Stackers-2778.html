One very objective observation about Stackers: If I were playing, I
wouldn't be committed to either offensive or defensive play.  But I
would be firmly committed to not being the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to place a stack of
my checkers on a stack of enemy checkers.  My reasoning being that
when I jump on you, the first thing that may happen is that you move
forward and push me back.  This is a double whammy for me.  You've
simultaneously advanced your standing and reversed mine, advancing
your relative standing by at least two.  Who knows how it will all
sort out?  Gameplay could become exceedingly complicated after that.
I just don't like the way the progression starts out, with me being
the first to form a mixed stack.

Is my Stackers strategy flawed and self ruinous?  More than likely.
I'm not a very good player of games in general.  But it's not
particularly far fetched that my opponent might have adopted the same
strategy as me.  In that case there wouldn't be any mixed stacks.
Stacks would only have color and number, not order - a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>huge<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
forfeiture of game tree acreage in a stacking game.  Like I said
earlier, uniformly but oppositely colored stacks would either flow
past each other or meet at an impasse.  Those would be the only two
possibilities given the constraints.

A comparison with Chess players moving their rooks from side to side
is misleading at best, not to mention the fact that that could
actually happen in a game of Chess between non-cooperating players.
