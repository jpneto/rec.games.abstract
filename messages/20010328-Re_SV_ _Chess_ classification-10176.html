Hello,


</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Go is no less a pure game of capture than a pure
game of territory, isn't it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Ralfs comments has been centered around the final goal and he clearly stated
that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Thank you!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
So go is purely a game of territory in this sense. Even otherwise, not
considering only the final goal, I consider go a game of territory now
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Consider the Ing rules of Wei Qi. His rules are actually the empirical
proof that even capturing stones in Go is just another expression of
making territory!


</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Logically, Phutball may be seen as a game of
connection as well. Or is it above all a game
about reaching a specific part of the board?
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The latter. You neither connect two or three edges of the board (e.g.
Twixt, The Game of Y), nor do you connect all your stones (Lines of
Action, Neighbour).

It is related to Alapo, Epaminondas, Camelot, Ko-an.

However, it appears to be logical to create two separate sub-groups:

(1) Win by reaching your opponent's base row (first row) with one  of your
    OWN pieces
(2) ... with a neutral piece


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Again, the final goal of Phutball is to move a piece somewhere. As a final
goal this is obviously the classification. In terms of strategy and
part-time goals, I would consider connection as well... but here, capture
seems more central than in Go.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Is trax made of two concurrent goals? Is one of
them about connecting two moving edges, or about
building up a pattern much as the other looping
goal? We could put Trax in the single class of
pattern games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I consider Trax a connection game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is a connection game (you win when you connect two  sides with a line)
AND it is a "geometrical shape" game (you win when you make a "loop").
This combination of EQUALLY important goals is very similiar to Havannah,
another hybrid game.
