    (Hmm, was Chinook running on the bare machine? if not, did they
consider the possibility of an OS failure?)  At any rate, this wasn't
fatigue, and is in no way contradictory to my above statement.  None of

    But i won't, until someone furnishes contrary information that is
relevant to the issue.  As Jonathan Schaeffer himself said:

Is this not an admission that the title has not been legitimately won?
Is it not poor sportsmanship to accept a title not legitimately won?
Feel free to enlighten me on this point.
