You are forgetting that there are third parties involved: the Boston Computer
Museum, the Match sponsors, the Checkers Association and so on.  I don't
think the Chinook team (or Tinsley) cares one iota about the title, but they
have an OBLIGATION to accept it in the best interest of the third parties.
[In my opinion, though, the title is silly to begin with...]

Furthermore, Tinsley probably does not share your view of the "sacrifices".
Remember that he wants the match as much as the Chinook team, and as Jonathan
explained, the organizers and the sponsors had done an excellent job of
making the match a pleasant one for Tinsley (and creating lots of publicity
for checkers, which Tinsley cares).  I can't speculate on Tinsley's health
condition, but from what I heard, it was not from match fatigue.

Finally, to Don Fong.  If the Chinook team refuses to play a rematch against
a healthy Tinsley, I would be the first one to cry foul.  But as it is, the
Chinook team is facing what to them must be the worst nightmare.  To accuse
them of poor sportsmanship under such conditions is tantamount to accusing
a grieving mother of killing her favorite son who just died due to some freaky
act of nature.
