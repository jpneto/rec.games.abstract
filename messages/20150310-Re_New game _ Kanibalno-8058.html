And let me wrap up this post with a question about the actual purposes of this site. Is this actually a site where people are invited and encouraged to discuss abstracts, or is it strictly a site for the self-aggrandizement of a few, primarily by insulting others?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

lol, good question.

A little historical context:

When I first got here years ago, rga was being lorded over by Bill Taylor and other math professors to discuss Nim variants.  I don't remember Taylor ever designing anything while he was here.  Instead he would remind everyone of games he had designed in the past and how they were "the world's simplest game" and other such braggadocio nonsense.  As with the insults, there was never any shortage of self-aggrandizement here.  At my peak I was announcing a new game here like every other month.  Taylor and his cronies would either ignore them, or make some snotty little condescending comment - and then ignore them.

Yes, insults were flying, as they do at every unmoderated site.  An unmoderated site is no place for pussies (not to suggest that you are one).  Long story short, me and Taylor eventually had a showdown, and he left the group, taking his math cronies, who knew jack squat about abstract game design, with him.  After that there was a surge in new game announcements from me, Nick Bentley and a bunch of other guys.  There have been periods of relatively high activity as well as low.  Right now it's pretty much me and Hazen.  I'm just here to shoot the shit since I've burned out on game design.  The other designers have pretty much dropped out too as far as I know.  Case in point, Nick.  He hasn't produced anything new in a long while - just minor tweaks to his existing games.  I think Christian Freeling may still be somewhat active in design but he doesn't come here because he takes self-aggrandizement to never before seen extremes, and no serious designer can stomach that.  I only invited Christian here to help chase out Bill Taylor, and he actually did a commendable job of that (thanks, Christian).  

Hazen is a fairly prolific inventor, mainly specializing in new mechanisms that can be used in other games.  Yes, you will be insulted by Hazen.  You will "win" not with counter-aggression, but with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>succinct<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> persuasive argument.  I.e., (no offense) not treatises or references to treatises.  Nobody has time for that.  If you've had enough, I for one wouldn't blame you.  I would just thank you for stoppin' in.

I would discuss Chess variants with you but I've proven not to be a Chess variant kind of guy.  At least not variants with all the kings, queens, pawns, checkmates, and all the things normally associated with Chess.  If you had a simple game, I'd discuss that with you, but I think you said you're not into simple games.

Hope this helps.  Off to my two hour, Chinese massage.  Ahhh, much needed :D
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Enjoy! The massage, I mean. They busted 6 of the Chinese massage parlors near me, but I'm guessing that's just a drop in the bucket, considering I live in the geographical center of the NYC metro area - based on the aiming point for Soviet missiles in the past and, I strongly suspect, current Russian missiles - if they can get out of their silos and make it across the ocean. 

I'm into games with simple rules, but I designed my way right out of chess variants with the CaM series, and since I do wish to make a little to cover costs of prototyping, I may have designed my way out of abstracts completely. Dunno, we'll see what comes to mind in the future, but I have a few ideas to pursue that aren't at all abstracts. 

I freely admit I tend to be circumloquacious. And I can spell the word without looking it up... which is part of the problem. Fwiw, hyperchess came about because I was having trouble with linear differential equations - found out I was visualizing my math, and couldn't visualize the 4th dimension. So to help with the problem, I drew a small bit of 4D graph paper, and studied that. Didn't do damn all for my math skills, but I realized it'd make a hell of a chess board... 35 or more years later, it led me to chessvariants.org, and I got sucked in. After a few years as a member, then some more as an editor, I learned a lot about the first step of design, and had written 2 treatises, the 4D one and another called the ShortRange Project, based on a series of designs that became an alternate history of chess. CaM, and with it my best design, the Battle of Macysburg, came out of that series.. 

I'm into simple rules that give complex games, if you consider chess and abstract strategy wargames to be reasonably complex. So it depends on your definition of "simple". I think Border War, the first CaM design that crossed the border from chess variant into wargame, to be simple, and there is a VASSAL implementation for that. It uses 5 different piece types, none of which moves more than 3 squares/turn. Leaders activate pieces within 2 squares of themselves (including themselves) and move 1 or 2 squares. They may change direction between the first and 2nd step. Infantry steps 1 in any (of the 8) directions. Skirmishers move like knights, and jump anythin in their way. Cavalry moves up to 3 squares orthogonally. Cannons move up to 3 squares diagonally. SImple chess moves. Capture is by replacement - move onto an opposing piece with a legal move and stop there, and the opposing piece is removed from the game. Terrain is very abstract. Pieces (except skirmishers) stop next to terrain they wish to enter, and move into terrain squares at the rate of 1 square/turn. Cannon can't move into trees. Cavalry can't move into hills - a standard heavy cavalry horse could not move effectively up or down a slope of over 7 degrees. And that, in brief, is all the basic rules. An amazing number of things just fall out of those basic rules. Players MUST keep a lot of reserves. Terrain offers a strong defensive position. Etc, etc. Very simple and streamlined, but it simulates a wargame better than a lot of wargames do! 

It took me about 50 iterations and several years to get from the original shatranj to Macysburg. Along the way, it taught me something about design. Despite what hazy thinks. And I'm fully capable of anything from a calm discussion of design to a knock down, drag out fight. On this site, I'd prefer the discussion. I'll stick around for as long as I can get that decent discussion. But I am a lumper, and you and hazmat are splitters; this will likely prove a source of some disagreements. ;)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That was interesting, Joe.  Thank you for explaining that.  Sparked my interest in Chess variants a little for the first time.  I googled Shatranj and some interesting images came up.  Do you have links for the various games?  They seem to have something in common with Arimaa and some of Christian Freeling's games.  Namely totally different types of playing pieces.

I actually hold Christian in high regard, both as a designer and as a person.  The singular issue I had with Christian was that he claimed one of his games was "perfectly balanced" (i.e. zero turn order advantage), and he repeated that claim at least 100 times that I know of in various forums.  I take abstract game science seriously and I know that there cannot be a perfectly balanced game.  He just seemed to be bastardizing game science to his own benefit.  And he repeated the name of said game at least 500 times.  That's why I can't even say it now.  It starts with an S.  I have a low tolerance for boredom.  I don't want to hear anything repeated 500 times, such as "Jesus loves you."  If I met Jesus I'd punch him in the face.  But Christian does have a certain mystique.  Don't tell him I said that.  He'll float off into the clouds.  I think Christian is the first designer I learned of, just searching around on the web.  

I had already designed my first game, Quadrature, at that time.  I manufactured it, took it to the New York Toy Fair, and ended up winning the Mensa award for it.  I was designing in a complete vacuum at that point, knowing only of Othello and a few of the classics.  I didn't even know I had designed an "abstract strategy game," as they were called then, or that there was a world of abstract games out there.  One day I was playing someone in the apartment I lived in at the time, whom I had played hundreds of times before, and we had an endless cycle type draw.  Up until then I didn't even know that could happen in Quadrature.  Some people don't mind draws, but they bug the crap out of me, especially the endless cycle type.  Ever since I've only designed drawless games.

What really elevated Christian even higher in my esteem was how he defenestrated Bill Taylor.  You could say he did it single handedly.  The minute Christian set foot here, sparks flew.

Bill Taylor to Christian Freeling (paraphrasing): "Who the fuck are you?"
Christian Freeling to Bill Taylor: "I'm Christian Freeling, world renowned game designer.  Who the fuck are you?"
Bill Taylor to Christian Freeling: "Er, uh, well you see, it's like this.  Um..."

A couple of people confirmed who Christian was to Taylor, who unbelievably had never heard of him.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Everybody<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> has heard of Christian Freeling, or so I thought.  Christian is a major designer in the world, and Bill Taylor is a schmuck.  He never made it out of the minor leagues.  The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> interesting game of his that I know of was recently programmed at Boardgames.net..  The programmer was for some reason compelled to notify me of that fact, noting that it fit my design criteria, to which I agreed, offering kudos to him and Taylor.

But that Freeling-Taylor confrontation was the beginning of the end of Bill Taylor's lengthy reign here.  The seed had been planted in his bloated, rotting pig brain.  It would eventually dawn on him that he was wallowing in the wrong pig pen, hogging up space, and had been all along.  Rga without the bloated fuck and his attendant maggots was an indescribable improvement, and I really owe that to Christian Freeling.  It almost overcomes my loathing of Christian's endlessly repeated, outlandish claims.

The games are kind of scattered around, some only in comments about related games, but most of the completed ones are on the chessvariants.org site, or the chessvariants wiki associated with it. The first games are various forms of shatranj - and that's how I met Christian Freeling - and the later ones are under the Warlord series title. The offshoots and some overly ambitious tries that went nowhere are in the wiki, along with a lot of writing that essentially explains what I was thinking about while doing the work that led to CaM. 

The interesting thing about the line of progression from shatranj to Macysburg is that there was one inspired sidestep that gave me Chieftain Chess (sounds a lot better than Chieftain Shatranj, which is what it really is) and I argue that there is no first turn advantage in that game. I offered to play black and pass my first turn so that white would get to move twice before black moved. After some discussion, HG Muller came up with the reason why - there is no promotion in Chieftain. Gotta make lunch now, so I'll continue this later. Seem to have pissed Moh off. Wait until I point out that he started the chop session with a comment of his about 4D chess...
