Definitely lame, as it stands.

In particular, the special status of corner cells is ridiculous.

As I have written before, the essential nature of Havannah is
the tension between the global goal of making a Y (or cross)
connection, competing with the local goal of making a loop.
This tension is a marvellous frissant, and leads to all sorts
of new tactics and strategies that do not appear in the usual
connection games.

Of course, it re-introduces a "race" element into the game,
which is unfortunate, but seemingly unavoidable, except by
re-writing the Y goal, and changing the board shape.
Even so there is a race to make a loop, so this element
is unavoidable.

But in any event, corners should <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>always<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be regular cells,
belonging to both adjacent sides.  That aspect of Havannah
is lunacy, and Joao Neto and I have been playing "Lisbon",
which is essentially Havannah without special corners,
for ages.  It's a great game!

But the tactics are very rich and interesting, which I believe is
mainly due to the presence of the loop win condition.

Quite so!   :-)
