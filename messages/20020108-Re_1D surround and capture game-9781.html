"Alan Baljeu" <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:abaljeu@sympatico.ca">&lt;abaljeu@sympatico.ca&gt;</a> writes in with an intriguing new game:

|&gt; described as go in 1D, but that doesn't work as a serious game. 

Actually, it does, provided of course that you use the superko rule and
area scoring, (yet another evidential point in favour of these options).

That is, it does about as well as Alan's new game; which is to say they make for
fascinating analysis, and interesting tactical/timing battles on a large scale, 
but neither seem to have any "strategic" element, which detracts somewhat.
A group of us have done extensive analysis on 1xn go, and other micro-boards.


|&gt; So I fiddled with the rules a bit and came up with something with surprisingly
|&gt; complex strategy.

Complex play, certainly.  As I say, I don't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> "strategy" is quite exact.

|&gt; Rules:

I have just touched them up slightly, to remove some slight gaps.  I don't
think I changed the intent of anything.

-------------
1. Black and white alternate in placing single stones on a line of n points.

2. If placing a stone thereby removes all the go-liberties of any group of stones
   of the opposite color, those stones are immediately removed.

3. It is illegal to place a stone where one was just removed.

4. Placing is compulsory if legal, and the game ends when the player having 
   the move cannot legally place anywhere.

5. The winner is the player with the most stones on the board at game end.
-------------

Rule 5 looks very natural and proper.  It may be noted that alternative scoring
methods are possible and natural, e.g. go-area (stones plus uniquely surrounded
empties), or go-territory (surrounded empties only; with or without captures).

That's actually 4 systems, but I feel Alan's original is far and away the most
natural.  It would be an interesting study to find (attainable) positions
where the various scoring rules gave a different winner.

It is intriguing to note that no "seki-like" end positions can possibly arise, 
i.e. where there is an empty space that cannot be played on. 

Optimum results on boards of size    1   2   3   4   5
                              are    1  -1   1  -2   1 (being 3-2 in fact)

5 was sufficiently exhausting (by hand) for me to stop there, but no doubt
computer analysis would be practicable for a little bit further.  It would
be interesting to see if the alternation in winners continued.

It is obviously possible to have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>ties<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> on any even or odd length board.  ( &gt;3 )

It is also possible to have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>draws<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (in the Conway sense, rather than ties),
on boards of sufficient lentgh.   One obvious try is to go for a "triple ko".

     . X O . O . O X . X O .      X to move   (length 12)

There is a "ko" at each end, and one in the middle.  With co-operation, it is
now possible for X to capture far right, then O far left, then X centre,
then O far right, and so on indefinitely.  This would not necessarily be
optimal for either player, of course.  It would be fun to find a position
where a draw was <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>optimal<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, in that if either broke from the cycle they
would lose.  The above could even be one such, though I doubt it.

The smallest legal cycle I could find was this  7-boarder...

   O . O . O X .    X to move...
   O . O X . X .
   O . O X . X O
   . X . X . X O
   . X . X O . O
   X X . X O . O
   . . O . O . O
   . . O . O X .
   O . O . O X .
   . X O . O X .        ...now O can take on the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>right<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> side and repeat 
                           the original position with reversed direction.
This gives an 18 (!) cycle.

This one is clearly not optimal.  (X should fill far right in the top posish.)

Here is an example that's part of a 10-cycle on this 8-length board...

   O . . . . O O .

...and I leave the solution as an exercise for the reader!


|&gt; Anyone want to challenge me to Alak-11?

Yes; I'll email separately.
