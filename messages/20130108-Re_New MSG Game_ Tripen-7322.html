What reputation? lol  I know exactly what you're talking about.  On Halloween I told you that kids coming around for candy was exciting, meaning that my life is boring and this injects some excitement.  You bizarrely interpreted this as sexual excitement.  Once I realized that, I played it up and acted like I really was sexually excited by little kids in ghost costumes.  I was just fucking with you because you're a retard.  You want to post that?  Go ahead.  I'm not the least bit intimidated by lowlifes who mop bathrooms in the local porn theater.

You're right, but you're stretching yourself way too thin here pal. Now the whole community here knows you're a pedophile. I have a screenshot from the conversation, certainly doesn't seem the least bit ironic to me. Its not surprising a priveleged spoiled manchild whose done nothing other than attached himself to the legacy of his father like a parasitic sponge would also be a decadent sexual deviant as well. Well way to go Mark your total lack of social awareness has finally culminated in you just openly admitting to being the most reviled sort of person within western society. If you're not intimidated then great but I don't really see you having any kind of standing here anymore. Anyway this was a pathetic attempt to cover your ass. It's a shame you are such a jackass you get involved in these trivial internet wars over nothing. I considered this a defensive measure but here you've just outed yourself so you could act like you had the upper-hand but you absolutely didn't. 

As much as I hate Chess, Checkmate!
