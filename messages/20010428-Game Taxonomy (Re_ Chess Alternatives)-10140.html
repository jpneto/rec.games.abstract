Inspired partly by Panther, and partly by my work on defining a taxonomic
framework of information*, I'm also working on a taxonomy of games.  I have
perhaps 100 abstract games to go through but the gist of it is that I don't
try to classify according to only one axis.  The "object" may be the primary
axis or attribute, but there are hierarchically subordinate ones as well:
strategy, tactics, capture, movement, placement, and format.  An interesting
outcome besides organization is of course the suggestion of game variants,
by modifying one or more attributes.  I would very much like this effort to
be a community one -- is anyone interested in participating?

I also think that a basic premise in classifying an abstract game is that
the
rules are parsimonious (i.e. formulated as simply as possible) -- so David's
"game G with king" dilemma is resolved by stripping away the logically
unnecessary king rule.  On the other hand, Anthony's "KING-GO" seems like
a new game -- a Go variant, not a chess variant.  Its object is king
capture,
not territory despite Panther's attempted re-definition of territory (the
rule of parsimony eliminates artificial and semantic facades).  Go's object
of territory becomes KING-GO's strategy -- unless someone really proves the
game is equivalent to Go under expert play, in which case it would vanish
from the taxonomy except as a footnote...

One can label (almost?) all abstract games as "territorial-capture" games
but
common usage suggests some distinctions (or specializations):  The
"territory"
(a stretch) in a game with "royal-capture" refers to one or more
distinguished
and typically movable pieces; the game ends immediately even though play
could
otherwise continue with royal-capture by the other side.  In a classic
"racing"
game, territory refers to distinguished "goal areas"; there is no re-capture
of
a goal area, and game ends even though play could otherwise continue leading
to
a draw or reversal.  In a classic "territory" game, the game ends only when
all
spaces have been captured and cannot be re-captured under reasonable play;
outcome is determined by counting spaces (possibly weighted).  An
"elimination"
game ends when no more piece capture is possible, and outcome is determined
by
piece count.  A "configuration" game is a territory game wherein only
certain
geometric shapes count (e.g. five-in-a-raw, rosette); typically the game
ends
immediately.  A "connection" game is a topological as opposed to geometric
configuration game (e.g. spanning the play-area, forming any loop).  Of
course
there are multi-criteria hybrids, misfits, and other interesting anomalies
:-)

In summary, I can enumerate the following:  (did I miss any?)
OBJECT checkmate, elimination, racing, territory, configuration, connection
Each needs to be further refined, e.g. checkmate/chess vs checkmate/capture,
configuration/line/5, configuration/square/any-size, hybrids thereof.

Vocabulary for other attributes:
STRATEGY mobility, position/center, fence ...
TACTICS development, position/boundary ...
CAPTURE displacement(/by-rank), sandwich, leapfrog, surround, strand ...
MOVEMENT adjacent/various, phalanx ...
PLACEMENT array, vacant, adjacent/orthogonal ...
FORMAT square/19, hex/rhombus/11 ...

Each attribute (OBJECT|STRATEGY|TACTICS|CAPTURE|MOVEMENT|PLACEMENT|FORMAT)
has
its own taxonomic tree of variations; a game that is multi-valued is less
elegant (well, to me) but can be more complex -- e.g. racing/corner/T OR
checkmate/capture/T (Terrace); config/line/4 OR config/square/any-size
(Teeko).
Some terms appear under different attributes.  Often it is hard to pin down
the
strategy vs tactics attributes of a game.  A few specific examples:

OBJECT|STRATEGY|TACTICS|CAPTURE|MOVEMENT|PLACEMENT|FORMAT
territory|mobility|boundary|sandwich|capture-required/initial-array|square/8
territory|influence|eye-making|surround/inside-and-outside|vacant|square/19
connection/span/own|fence|bridge|none|vacant|hex/rhombus

This is very much a work in progress.  Suggestions and comments are most
welcome!

* Anyway, this is my approach to a taxonomic framework: each attribute-value
space is a hierarchical controlled vocabulary; each instance can be
multi-valued.
One might think of it as a next-generation search engine (I was the
principal
author of Infoseek).

Oh, yes, I see. I really misunderstood him.

I guess you would argue that the overall game is simply GO, not a chess

Yes. I would call the king a trophy (like a "cup" in a game of soccers),
because he is not part of the (actual) game. He is something beyond the
game.

And the point is, most (including myself and I presume David)
would agree with you.  The problem is that you define a chess variant to
be a game where the goal is to capture an opponent "king", and the
overall game above satisfies your definition.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, because this "king" doesn't belong to the actual game. BTW, I think
your argumentation is rather artificial. I develloped my classification
system of intellectual games after I wrote down the rules of more than 100
(now about 130) games (and not only the rules!). Then I began to think
about how to organize these games in distinct chapters that are logically
consistent.

Therefore, I would argue that your definition is flawed and needs to be

I don't think so.

It is not necessary, but, in practice, usually, games with non-movable
pieces just wouldn't work (they would be "unplayable").

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Let me now invent the game KING-GO.  It is played exactly like GO except
(1) the first stone a player places is called his king, and (2) the
player who captures the opponent king wins.  (To make this game
interesting, we probably need to add the no-pass rule also.  But such a
rule is not needed to define the game; it is only needed to add
interest.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you would play Go you would know that it is absolutely necessary.
Without the "additional" rule it would be easy to make the king part of a
living group and no player could capture the opponent king stone. The game
would be unplayable, because it would always end in a draw.

With the added rule basically the player who gets the larger territory
would capture the opponents king (this is not 100% exact, but should
suffice for the moment). It's a little bit like Gonnect. Gonnect
pretends to be a connection game, while KING-Go pretends to be a chess
variant. However both games as played by good Go players (like me) are
nothing else than territory games. Who has more territory is either
decided by being able to connect two opposing edges or by capturing a
royal stone. However, these are only new methods to determine the size of
the territory, NOT the goal.
