I can't say this is much better, not only did I read the rules but I
dutifully read through the account of your design process that led you

the site to give other members of the community a forum discuss
abstract games on a technical level after Nick Bentley led me to
believe Mark's attitude had had a significant effect on the traffic of
this site.
