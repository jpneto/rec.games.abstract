Hi all,

Yesterday, when I was skimming through Cameron Browne's impressive
book "Connection Games: Variations on a Theme", I came across the
Unlur rules, which I thought I knew well, and was amazed to (re)
discover that a player loses if he makes the opponent's winning
connection with his own pieces. As Browne notes, this implies that
some moves by either side may actually damage that side's position,
which looks a bit strange in connection games. Then I wondered why the
rules doesn't avoid this by simply stating: "Black wins if he makes a
Y which touches three non-adjacent sides of the board and loses if he
can't possibly do it". Wouldn't it be more elegant, and thus
preferable? Is there any obvious fault with this that I can't see?
