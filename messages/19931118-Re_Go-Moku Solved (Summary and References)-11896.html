  &gt;Where can we get Victoria? IwantitIwantitIwantit!!! :-)
  &gt;I.e. does anyone know L.V.Allis' email address?

Well, he probably wouldn't welcome unsolicited requests...  

If you look at the header of one of his paper's, it may have the email
address <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:allis@cs.rulimburg.nl">"allis@cs.rulimburg.nl"</a>, but you didn't hear it from me!  :-)

  &gt;|&gt; This is Allis'
  &gt;|&gt; third scalp, having solved Connect Four (TM) in 1989, and (resolving)
  &gt;|&gt; Qubic (TM) in 1991.
  
  &gt;I would love to see either a proof or programs that solve these games!
  &gt;Does anyone have any more information?

Here's a bit more information, from (my sometimes faulty) memory:

There is a unique win for the first player in Connect Four (d1).  If I
remember correctly, one reply (b1, or symmetrically f1) requires another
unique winning follow-up (b2, f2?).  Allis' gold-medal winning program was
called VICTOR, and used a combination of search and strategic knowledge.
At about the same time, James D Allen also proved that the game is a win,
using almost exclusively brute-force search.

Qubic (4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe) was first solved by a mathematician in around
1980, but the result went largely unnoticed.  Victor Allis independently
showed it to be a win for the first player, and used that solution in a
program (called "Qbig", I think) which also won at the (third) Computer
Olympiad.  There are only two distinct first moves, due to symmetries,
and the winning ones are top or bottom corners, or inside squares of the
middle layers.

There is also a book on the third Computer Olympiad, but I don't have the
reference handy.
