Hey Nick!

Nice to see you are still on the boil, and still on the ball!    :)

This game looks like a good one!  A simple but obvious,
even "canonical" idea - I wish I'd thought of it myself.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
regarding how to modify Quoridor, one of the
World's Greatest Abstract Games (TM),
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

We call them "Sagme's specials".   After Sagme Trabsact,
the patroness saint of abstract games, (more history on her
at Joao Pedro Neto's website).  And YES, I agree that
the whole Quoridor concept is one of the world's greatest
game ideas, or "ludemes".

Joao and I have discovered andplayed a number of variants,
and I give what is probably the our (pure race) version below.
But the assassin variation is a grand idea, I can't wait to test it!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The idea is to concoct a cross between Chess and Quoridor,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

To be fair, this is far more Quoridor than Chess; it is not really
specifically chessy at all - many games have capturing.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4. On any turn in which you choose to place a wall, you must(may?)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

"Must" is usually better in this type of game.  We find that
otherwise "opposition" type situations can easily occur,
where neither side wants to move first.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
don't know what the starting positions of King's &amp; Pawns should be
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>guess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is, a little inside the corner borders, with the two
assasins farthest from their target kings.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I've not tested these rules,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It looks good to me.  Please email me with a start size and
position as above, whatever you think appropriate, with ascii
diagram, and we'll have a go.   One thing however...

I VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND, for this and any other Quoridor
variants - that the original idea that there be a limited number
of walls to be available for use be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely abandoned<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

I strongly suspect this rule was introduced merely to save
the game makers some money.  It is highly artificical,
and the number of walls is completely arbitrary.  Having walls
in unlimited supply allows greater opportunity for player skill.
We have found in our played variants that it is far better.

All the above considerations indicate that the best games
will not have this unnecessary limitation.  My offer to
play assumes we will be using the unlimited rule. In fact
I can't really stand playing variants with limited walls any more!

I was going to show our own best variant, but it would probably
be best to start a new thread for it.

Congratulations once again, Nick, for this excellent ludeme!!
