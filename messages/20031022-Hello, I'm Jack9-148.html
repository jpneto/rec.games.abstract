I'm new to this list. I am interested in a certain type of abstract
game. Since I'm basically a gamer right now and can't consider myself
an abstract game enthusiast, I wasn't sure of some of the terminology
or available abstract games/sites from which to draw comparison. I
would a appreciate a link to the Newsgroup FAQ and maybe some links to
the sites most relevant to:

Abstract games which have no set turns (or turns limited by mandatory
playspace, like GO or tic-tac-toe)

Abstract games involving visually differing centers of power (that
have visual cues as to the sphere of their influence if possible). If
anyone knows the boardgame Samaurai (link -
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.klear.com/samurai/">http://www.klear.com/samurai/</a>); that's basically what I like, although
the idea was limited by the board...hence a boardgame?

Board games that have original abstract concepts. Uniques. TwixT is
another version of Tic Tac Toe in my eyes (connect opposing sides of a
board). Chess and Shogi (a bunch of pieces trying to attack a specific
piece). I thought Fortress America was much different than any other
game before, starting with 3:1 ratio, adding 1 sided growth and
guaranteed attrition.

Anyways, thanks for the read-thru and glad to meet you too!
