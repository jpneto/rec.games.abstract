I played Mau once at UCB a few years ago.  I normally don't like games with
tons of rules, but I enjoyed this one.  I meant to write down the rules the
next morning so I wouldn't forget them, but I never got down to it.  But then
I figured it was a UCB thing.  Who else could play this game, right?  Well,
after reading some of the articles here, it appears Mau is played all over the
place, so I'd like to try to recall as many of the rules as possible.

I realized that it's the type of game where any rule I make up is just as good
as any rule somebody else already has, but I'd like to get back some of the
crazier ones I can't remember.

Here are the ones I do remember:
- Aces change the direction of play.
- If n 2's have been played in a row, then the current player must either play
  a 2 or take 2^(n-1) cards from the pile.
- Clubs have to be announced ("two of clubs," "ten of clubs," etc.).  In
  addition, the Jack of clubs has to be announced "Jack of clubs, like a
  bicycle."
- I believe Aces had a catch phrase, but I don't recall.
- Eight work as in Crazy Eights; one calls a suit and play continues as if that
  suit had been played.

If anyone else can remember some of the rules they played with, I'd love to
hear them.  Great newsgroup, by the way...
