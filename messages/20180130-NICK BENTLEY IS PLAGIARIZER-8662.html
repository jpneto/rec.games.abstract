He took my idea from my game Sozee and he used all his "imagination" (he has not at all except for treachery) to use my capture system which is unique.
So he created BUG (which is a real BUG).
I predict that this game will not succeed at all!!! Yes guys are going to play it but the big flaw of the this game is that he IS BORING for anyone who is a real player. 
Remember me : BUG is doomed for failure not only because it is boring but because it is FLAWED like Meander, Carteso, Connecticut and other crappy games.

BGG forum banished me as usual following the orders of the forum`s Ayatollahs.
