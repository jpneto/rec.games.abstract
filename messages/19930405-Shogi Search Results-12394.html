The Usenet pays off;  my question about computer Shogi provoked the 
following responses, among others:

Keith Fuller says that Matthias Muts says:
 
Hello friends of computer shogi,

some weeks ago I announced GNU Shogi 1.0 for UNIX platforms using
the gcc C-compiler. I promised to send a new announcement in case of
changes of the program. Well, I hat not the time to make "major"
changes, that means I am still working on regarding opening
patterns. Nevertheless, several bugs have been fixed and the current
version seems worth to be notified. GNU Shogi 1.0 has reached patchlevel 10,
XShogi 1.0 has reached patchlevel 9. If you have tried the very first
versions, you will observe that the current version plays better
than the first version.

You can obtain the files by anonymous FTP. Connect to
"forwiss.fmi.uni-passau.de" (132.231.1.10). Set working directory 
to "pub/local/shogi". Set mode to "binary". Retrieve the Shogi
program with "get gnushogi-1.0p10.tar.Z". On a XWindow platform,
the graphical interface may be of value: "get xshogi-1.0p9.tar.Z".
Furthermore, I will place an Macintosh executable in the archive, but
this version should be handled with care (not well tested).

  Enjoy,
      Matthias Mutz.

My friend was able to pick up a Shogi cartridge for the Gameboy sold
on the net.  It was, of course, a Japanese cartridge.  There are also
cartriges available for the PC-Engine (The Turbo-Graphx 16 in the US
but an adaptor is needed) which play like Battle Chess (The pieces can
be made to look like creatures, etc.).  From what I've heard, computer
Shogi games play only so well and then they can't to any better.  This
is due to the exponential complexity of the game...

Try buying a video-game magazine that has an advertizement for a place
that sells Japanese video games.  Call them up and see if they can order
you the Gameboy cartridge.  It works with the US Gameboy -- at least it
did when I tried it -- and it worked pretty much like any video-oriented
Western Chess game.

Tony laughs:

Whatsa' matter, Mike?  Not anyone to play Shogi with? Its a good game,
though...A real brain buster.  Been playing long?  And ICD has a Shogi
program...I think... (800) 645-4710.

Mike:
In rec.games.abstract you write:

There's Shogi Master, for about $50 from:

                  ISHI PRESS INTERNATIONAL
                    76 Bonaventura Drive
                    San Jose, CA   95134

                      (408) 944-9900

I'm not terribly pleased with the quality of play, but that may be due to the
slow speed of my machine. I hear it's quite strong on a 386-based machine
running at 20 Mhz. The graphics are excellent, and there are lots of bells and
whistles.

[book stuff deleted]

Good luck!
