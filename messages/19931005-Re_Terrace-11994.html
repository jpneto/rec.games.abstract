	Any Terrace players out there?

Isn't that the board strategy game with the non-level playing field 8-).  I
have it and played a couple of games, but I've never found anyone
interested enough in playing to be able to get any feel for the strategy
involved, beyond the most basic tactics.  Anyone else out there play?

Brief description:  Two of the four corners of the board are raised,
and it goes from low to high in terraces.  The pieces are varying sizes
of hemispheres, and the game is two-player (I think there might be a
four-player varient, but I've never played it).  The rules are simple,
but I don't have my copy with me, so I might get it wrong.
