That new board was an exercice of game design not for you Sir Clark.
You are too dumb to even try to find appropriate rules.
When you say about a scoring system is brilliant you seem to ignore that any scoring system could be formalized mathematically and it will be then easy to find the optimal one. There is almost nothing to imagine to create an optimal scoring system once you put into equation all the component of the scoring system.
In other words there is no brilliant scoring system at all! 
I laugh at you loudly when I read on bgg such stupidities coming from you.
Who play your crappy game Slither?
Not even you!!!
If you want to invent games erase all what you know until now and start thinking otherwise.
