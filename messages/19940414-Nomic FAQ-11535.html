Hello again,

   It seems that I definitely have enough interest to make a Nomic FAQ 
worthwhile. I have facilities to make it available on a WWW site, but 
I'm not sure about FTP. (I'll have to ask my Uni admin.) Can anyone 
volunteer an FTP site, should I be unable to wangle one?

Will everyone out there who has some sort of Nomic resource on the Net 
- be it a mailing list, FTP site, WWW page, MUD, whatever - please mail 
me the details. Even if you think I should already know, I would like
to have an official copy.

Anything anyone wants to see included in the FAQ, also mail me. Especially
if you know of some Nomic-related game, or you have an excellently worded
paragraph describing "What is Nomic?".

News here is a little flaky, and I don't necessarily keep up with the
mailing lists this is going to, so please send me mail.

Malcolm
