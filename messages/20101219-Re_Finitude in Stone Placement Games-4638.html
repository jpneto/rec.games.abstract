How do you guarantee that the game will end?  Well, the
simplest way is not to have capturing and just let the board
fill up.  This impacts robustness though.   On an odd sized
grid, Black will have the first move, the last move, and
altogether one more move than White.  All of this will
either be an advantage or a disadvantage to Black, but not
neither.

I've got some thoughts on this, the first being that the post

:)  Yes, I suppose the article did turn out to be MSG-centric.  A note of
explanation might be in order.  Obviously naturally finite (superko free)
stone placement games with heavy recycling are a passion of mine.  In the
interests of fair play, I wanted to include other so described games by
other designers in the article.  It's not that I considered their games and
deemed them unworthy.  It's that they don't exist.

You've brought some dignity to rec.games.abstract, Christian.  It's still a
barnyard of course, but, if you can look past the paranoid ranting of Bill
Taylor, it's a more dignified barnyard.

Meanwhile I'm interested in your concept of "robustness"
- is it linked only to the first/second move advantage or
do other factors play a role?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Two factors.  1) First move advantage, or more precisely, the onset of move
order advantage with advancing skill.  2) Draw rate, or the onset thereof. 
I design draws out from the outset so I'm left to contend with move order
advantage in my designs.

Is Hex not robust because it needs a meta rule to
balance it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

7x7 Hex (without the pie rule) would be non-robust.  With advancing skill,
the game will eventually be swamped with first move advantage.  Even with
the pie rule, if the board is small enough it will be ruined by second move
advantage.

Robustness and scalability are related concepts.  Is a game even scalable
and, if so, how finely scalable?  In Hex, as with many games, to combat
first move advantage you increase the size of the board.  You can't just add
another row and create a long quadrilateral.  You have to jump up to the
next larger rhombus.

7x7=49 cells ---&gt; 8x8=64 cells.  A 30% increase.

It could be worse though.  You could be required to jump up to the next
larger <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>odd<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> size rhombus.

7x7=49 cells ---&gt; 9x9=81 cells.  A 65% increase.

In Oust you can jump up to the next size board.  Even or odd, or shape,
don't matter in a game of total annihilation.  Yay annihilation.  In Rive,
you have to jump up to the next odd sized board, since it's a territory
game, but board shape doesn't matter so you can just add an extra row.

I think you're jumping the gun here,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

:)  This has all been musing on my part and is by no means intended as any
sort of design how-to.

Consider the following "game".  Black and White take turns placing a single
stone of their own color onto an unoccupied cell on an odd size board. 
Whoever ends up with the most stones on the board wins.  Automatic win for
Black.  About as non-robust as you can get.

Now consider said game with sporadic, multi-stone captures interspersed. 
For one thing you get "more game for your money".  Not that economics is the
focus.  But getting more moves out of a given set of equipment combats first
move advantage simply by lengthening the game.  As a rule of thumb, a game
should be at least 60 moves.  A 60 move game will generally be a lot more
robust than a 20 move game.

Capturing combats move order advantage not just by lengthening the game
though.  It injects chaos, uncertainty about future positions.  Does this
destroy depth?  No.  Oust has as much depth as any game.  But the boardscape
can change pretty dramatically during play, and not always predictably.

Don't forget about Cage  :)  I guess it depends on how you define variant. 
You'd probably need a special appendix on games that are noteworthy in
relation to Draughts, but are too perversely deviant to be included in the
main text.
