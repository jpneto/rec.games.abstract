No, simultaneous movement isn't "perfect information".  But it is far

If the random events have a finite number of possible outcomes with rational
probabilities (which is normally the case), and the game is zero sum, then
there is an equivalent game without (expilicit) randoness that uses
simultaneous moves to generate the same effects.

Untrue, because there is an element of psychology in simultaneous move games
that is absent in random mechanisms.  By your hypothesis, rock-paper-scissors
is equivalent to throwing dice to see who will be high-roller, and it isn't.
The human mind is very bad at generating true randomness; you produce patterns
which the opponent can detect and exploit.  Expert players of rock-paper-
scissors (yes, there are such) will detect your patterns and beat you fairly 
consistently.

Rock, Paper, Scissors is pretty the same as rolling dice. People know how
to play the game so as to guaranty a tie on average. (Just roll dice to
see what to do.) If BOTH players want to try to engage in a meta game of
who can outguess the other, then they can aggree to do so. But either one
can opt out by choosing randomly. The pattern matching aspects of the meta
game are interesting and has uses outside of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors.

And even more complicated simove games have optimal strategies where players
should randomize their moves to have the largest expected value, no matter
what strategy their opponent uses.
