There are several games that introduce chance into a Chess game.
One of these is Nightmare Chess. It adds cards to the game that
allow special powers or constraints to a piece. They also create
bazaar situations.

What I mean is a random way to produce positions that seem to be nearby to humans, possibly increasing the strength of one side or the
other. For example, one could declare that in 5 moves, a pawn would be added to one side or the other, somewhere on the second, third,
or fourth ranks. Then playing out one position might reveal that it seems to win an average of 0.3 points, whereas another move might
win 0.2 points. Of course, this does not guarrantee that the first position was stronger than the second, but it would provide
feedback that I believe would be valuable to people playing ordinary chess.

It might be that the randomization method should depend on the position, e.g., if the tactics are tight in one part of the board, one
could randomly shift undeveloped pieces in another part of the board.
