Goodbye, Mark and Christian.  It's been interesting, but can't stick
around with Corey Clark attacking me at every turn.  I don't
understand it, and don't have to subject myself to it.  Maybe we will
meet up somewhere else on the net.  And Christian, I can't really
understand why you think a Corey Clark moderated group is something
you want to participate in, but wish you the best anyway.

lol you've hardly received the brunt of it. I wouldn't have attacked
you again if you hadn't defended Steere's antisocial behavior. I mean
what did you expect by presenting yourself as an extension of Mark
Steere's insatiable ego? And what's more is that I'm not in the right,
you could've attacked me but you went after Zhang and he clearly
wasn't looking for a fight. So there's your answer.
