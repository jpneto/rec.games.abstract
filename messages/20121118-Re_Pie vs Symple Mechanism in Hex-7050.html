Hi Tristan.  Thanks for your response.  I don't believe Zermelo's theorem is immediately applicable to Symple Hex because the players don't "move alternatingly" (i.e. make one placement per turn).

You're not alone.  Symple Hex is "overly complicated", according to someone who played it.  It's a total kludge.

White's first placement would not be random.  Rather he'd claim the center cell.

Perfect play implies a predetermined win for either Player 1 or Player 2 in every finite-decisive game, including Hex and Symple Hex. It's Player 1 in Hex and unknown by me in Symple Hex, but predetermined nonetheless.  

Turn order advantage has meaning only in imperfect play.  11x11 Hex with pie, for example, is known to be well balanced (i.e. having only slight second player advantage) for advanced players.  Extreme experts might experience a significant enough Player 2 advantage though that they would opt to bump up the board size to 13x13.

The problem with 11x11 Symple Hex is twofold.  First, Player 1 will claim the center cell.  This creates an immediate, huge imbalance.  Secondly, Symple Hex allows several placements per turn.  As an extreme example, imagine a game called Hex-11 where Player 1 is granted 11 placements on his first turn in otherwise ordinary 11x11 Hex.  Hex-11 is an obvious one turn win for Player 1.  The average number of placements per turn in 11x11 Symple Hex isn't as extreme as in Hex-11, but it's pretty extreme.  Player 2 could win on his 5th turn, for example - less than half the minimum turns required to win at 11x11 Hex.  Reducing the number of turns has a direct, negative impact on balance.

For the above reasons, I would tend to agree with Marvin Spellbinder's posit that "11x11 Symple-Hex would certainly succumb to turn order advantage."
