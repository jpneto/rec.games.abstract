A discussion came up on Boardgame Geek to discuss abstract strategy
games, and I asked what people's thoughts were to have a world champ
at abstract strategy games in general, or one for chess variants as a
single category (rather than one variant).  The thread is here:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1663392">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1663392</a>

Well, I am curious if anyone knows if there is an official association
of abstract strategy players, or one for chess variants, to regulate
the determining of who would be champion of abstract strategy games in
general, or more specifically chess variants.

Anyone know of this for sure?  If there isn't one, is anyone here
interested in starting one?

Thank you for your time...

Again, is anyone interested in getting one started?
