I have an idea for a very careful addition to chess which keeps the
masters' skills relevant, but which could give it a much-deserved
boost among new players. A handicap system based on set openings. I
imagine a system based on a deck of cards, where the aces represent
the most equal openings, and the kings the most biased. Since there
are four suits, there are four possible starting positions for any
handicap level, giving some variation (ensuring that handicap 4 level
games will not always lead to open positions etc.). To make it extra
neat, spades and clubs could be openings where black has the
advantage, and hearts and diamonds could favour white.

To play a game, just sort out the four cards of the appropriate
handicap level, make the weaker player draw one, and play through the
moves written on the card. If unsure of the handicap level, draw from
a range of levels instead.

While you would need a special kind of deck that has the openings
printed on them, an expert would just memorize them, and thus be able
to improvise a handicap game with only a regular deck of cards (or
anything, really). This would make it much easier for the expert to
bring new people into the game, and make chess culture less
intimidating to outsiders. Chess purists probably won't mind; they can
just abstain from playing handicap games.

This a much better way of handicapping than the traditional way of
playing with a piece less: Card handicap positions are positions which
could have (theoretically, maybe) arisen in regular play, and so it
becomes the same game to a larger degree.

The big problem is deciding how big the handicap levels should be, and
finding a set of 52 openings that fits them. To some degree we could
use computer analysis, especially for the second step, but it would be
much better and reliable with input from a couple of strong chess
players.
