lol...What a complete loser you are.  Let's see...hmmm...you forgot to
include the title PYRAMID SCHEME at the top of your post.  And, you forgot
to tell everyone that what you did is illegal, and it violates state as well
as federal law regardless of what you say.

Notwithstanding all that, I would suggest that anyone who wants to get
involved do this:  Do not send any money to the players on the list he gives
you.  Instead put your name at the top of the list, and the names of some of
your friends in the other spots, and then email out your lists.  You still
won't make very much money, and the money you do make will come from people
who probably couldn't afford it that you swindled.
