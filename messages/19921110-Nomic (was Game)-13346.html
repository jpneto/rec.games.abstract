There is a totally awesome game invented by Douglass Hofstadter
called NOMIC where the game consists of making the rules for the game
itself.

Can be VERY amusing or VERY syupid, depending on who plays and what
kind of mood you're in.

I've never played by Hofstadter's rules but I have played several
times using home-brewed rules.  We started off playing a simple card
game.  Each time a player won a round he was able to propose a rule
change.  That got a bit silly until someone changed the rule-changing
rule so that all other players proposed rule changes and the winner
chose which one would become law.  That worked very well.  We evolved
such a fun card game that on subsequent occasions we just played the
game with no changes.  The best rule we came up with was this: When
you play a heart you say "throb, throb, throb", when you play a club
you say "bonk, bonk, bonk", when you play a diamond you say "twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle" and when you play a spade you say "dig, dig, dig".
You can tell what sort of mentality the players had!

So Biggs, you're the idiot who bought all these IBM PCs.  You're fired!
