Bill, doesn't your whole department at the University of Canterbury in New
Zealand watching you embarrass yourself (and them) change your game plan
now?  You almost did the right thing with your disingenuous, tear streaked
goodbye.  The only problem is, you came running back two days later! rofl

I would have bowed out quietly.  If I did have to say something, it would
be:

"Guys, it's been fun.  This shit has gotten out of control to where it's
impacting my professional life.  No can do.  Sorry.

Go crazy.   I'm out."

The major difference being that I wouldn't come running back two days later!

Bill, what kind of impression do you think this makes on your professional
colleagues at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand?  What about that
sexy Chinese lady you've being dying to get "down under" with since the day
she arrived?

She's on the phone right now with her parents in China, crying in Mandarin:

"Bill Taylor is bad man.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> bad man.  He uses bad word."
