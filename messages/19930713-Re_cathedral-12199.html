well, since i only played the game several times consecutively at a friend's 
house several years ago, i think the peroson that owns the game should 
describe....  all i recall for certain was that there was a cathedral (in 
standard cathedral crucifix shape, floorplanwise)  that weighed quite 
significantly strategically in the game.  unfortunately, i seem to recall 
picking it up fast enough to start winning consistently with minimal 
perspicacity - also sagacity did NOT seem to be crucial, either.  yes, a 
strategic type game, but not the first thing to come to mind as something to 
play to satisfy desires to play a strategic game NOR a game with singular 
pieces.  ...pretty cool though....
