Can anyone tell me what the rules to the strategy game Rubik's Magic.
I bought a set at a flea market and it didn't have rules with it.  I
have been playing with a set of rules I made that seem to work well,
but I still would like to know what the original rules to the game
are.

Here goes (this is from memory, so may not be entirely accurate):

One player plays circles, the other diamonds.

On a turn, a player must do both of the following:
	a) place one of his pieces in an empty space (either the
	   black or silver side up - his choice)
	b) flip an opponent's piece one square (that is, move it one square
	   orthogonally and flip it to the other side, as if it were
	   hinged on the border between the spaces)

The object is to get three of your pieces in a row (orthgonally or
diagonally), with the same side showing (i.e., all black or all silver).


Possible errors:
	I'm not sure whether both parts of a turn are mandatory.  I
	<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> you MUST play a piece, and you must flip a piece if
	possible, but there's no penalty if it's not possible.

	I'm not sure that you have to flip an opposing piece - nearly
	sure, but not quite.
