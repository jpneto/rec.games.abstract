It seems the problem with Mark is that he doesn't satisfy all

I give credit where credit is due.  When I accidentally rediscovered

Absurd, but remarkably familiar. I moderate a few mathematical 
mailing lists specialising in prime numbers. The number of 
times I see posters re-inventing the wheel (quite literally 
sometimes) is enormous. And most annoying. 

The information is out there. There are well-known classic texts 
documenting all the fundamental principles of both fields. There
is no reason why anyone should reinvent or rediscover anything
so simple and common.

If you can't have it (credit, that is), no-one can?

I tried the Vista speech recognition by running the tutorial. I was 
amazed, it was awesome, recognised every word I said. Then I said the 
wrong word ... and it typed the right one. It was actually just 
detecting a sound and printing the expected word! -- pbhj on /.
