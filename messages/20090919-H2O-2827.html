A colleague just told me her son invented this game during his
chemistry class.  It's nice and simple, though maybe the rules need to
be tweaked for optimal play. I haven't done an analysis of the game
tree.

Starting with an empty  m x n  grid, players take turns depositing
either one "H" or one "O" in a cell. If you form a molecule of water
(H-O-H), you get a point; if you form a molecule of hydrogen (H-H) or
oxygen (O-O) your opponent gets a point. Play continues until all
m.n  cells are filled. Winner determined by point total. That's it.

I assume the molecular bonds should be parallel to the sides of the
game board. I guess both linear and right-angled water would be
accepted
(since we can't get the real 108-degree angle here :-) ). Once an atom
is incorporated into a molecule it should probably not be allowed to
be used in a future molecule. It's not clear what should happen when
a newly-placed atom can complete multiple molecules at once -- I
suppose
the player who put it there should pick the one molecule to be formed
from his or her atom. Maybe the game is better suited to a hexagonal
board, with a water molecule accepted only when the angle at the  O
is 120 degrees.

Like Dots-and-Boxes it seems most of the game will continue without
much excitement until the end of the game, when a few decisions have
to be made very carefully.

Comments?
