Twixt is a game that was released as a board game by Avalon Hill in the 60s
and I've always thought it was really cool and even considered trying to
get a computer to play it.

You start with a board of some reasonably large size, the larger the board,
the longer the game, that is a square grid of holes, try 20 x 20 for a good
game.

Below is a diagram of a 10 x 10 board:

o : o   o   o   r   o   o   o   o : o
  :                               :
o : o   o   o   o   o   o   r   o : o
  :                               :
o : o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o : r
  :                               :
o : o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o : o
  :                               :
o : o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o : o

The line of :'s represent red lines.  The -'s represent black lines.  Each
play must create a boundary that extends from the edge past one of his lines
across the board to the edge on the other side (i.e. across his colored lines).

Play alternates.  There are two types of pieces, pegs and connectors.
On your move, you place one peg.  Then, as a second part of your move, you
may place connectors between any of your pieces that are a knight's move
(from chess) away from each other.  Thus, the selection of r's above would
all be connected in a position indicating a win for red.

You can easily play this on graph paper and its worth playing around with
a little to see how interesting it is.
