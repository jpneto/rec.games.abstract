The chess variant Renaissance by Matthew Montchalin -- 1975 -- also
features a piece called the resurrector that "gives birth" to a piece

Interesting. �Link? �Or a more specific description for those of us who

I don't think there's a link to it; I only know of the game from
direct correspondence with its inventor many years ago, and
publication in Pritchard's "The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants", in
the making of which Christian had a part, I believe.

I tried to find that book online but it's out of print.  There's a second
edition called the "Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants," but I don't
know if it will have Renaissance.

When you capture an opposing piece, it changes color and goes into
your reserve.  In Shogi, you can drop a piece from your reserve almost
anywhere on the board (there are a few restrictions) instead of making
a move.  In Shogi, therefore, there is no such thing as an "endgame",
but rather the game is a checkmating race.  In Renaissance, only a
resurrector move can bring pieces onto the board from the reserve, and
players also start with two pieces that are in the reserve from the
beginning.

So, how does the resurrector move?
