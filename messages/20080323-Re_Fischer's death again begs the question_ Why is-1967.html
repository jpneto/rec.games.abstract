<br>The GM Slugfest is the most famous that I'm aware of. It used BAP
<br>scoring. (Black win =3, White win =2, Black draw =1)
<br></blockquote>
<br>OK, that's a start.&nbsp; From what I can see, there were two of these
<br>tournaments, one in 2005 and one in 2006.&nbsp; According to [1], the 2006
<br>tournament was held over three days and had a field of fourteen
<br>players whose strength ranged from 2670 down to 1952 (USCF), with the
<br>following spread:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2600+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 players
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2500-2599&nbsp; 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2400-2499&nbsp; 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2300-2399&nbsp; 1
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2200-2299&nbsp; 3
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2100-2199
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000-2099
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1900-1999&nbsp; 1
<br>
<br>I've not found a full crosstable anywhere so I don't actually know
<br>what percentage of the games in the tournaments were draws.&nbsp; However,
<br>the very wide spread of abilities among the players would tend to
<br>reduce the frequency of draws under any scoring system, as would the
<br>pressures of a short Swiss tournament, where the only way to win the
<br>tournament is to win almost all your games.&nbsp; The wide range of
<br>abilities in that tournament seems very significant to me.
<br>
<br>
<br></blockquote>&gt; I'd also say that the BAP system is extremely unfair.&nbsp; In particular,
<br><blockquote type=cite>in the given tournament, we can probably assume that the 1952-rated
<br>player lost all his games, since he was the weakest player by nearly
<br>300 points[2].&nbsp; Half of the people who played against him were given
<br>the white pieces so their `free wins' were worth only two points; the
<br>other players were given three points for their wins against him.&nbsp; Mig
<br>Greengard[3] and GM Joel Benjamin[4] don't think BAP is a good idea,
<br>especially in tournaments with a wide spread of player strength.
<br></blockquote>
<br>A few points:
<br>
<br>The normal scoring system is biased toward White. BAP is biased toward
<br>Black (though the bias is less than White's with normal scoring) There is
<br>nothing fundamentally different about the two cases. Technically you are
<br>correct, however, that it is "unfair". Similarly normal scoring is "unfair" yet
<br>it hasn't prevented it from being used.
<br>
<br>In any Swiss tournament, the bottom player will almost never play the top 
players.
<br>
<br>The 1900 player I believe was Clyde Ballard (the "B" in BAP), included to give 
the
<br>experimental tournament an even number of players.
<br>
<br>The "beliefs" held by random folks aren't important; the strengths of their
<br>arguments are.

<br>[2] That is, every other player in the field would expect to win at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; least 85% of their games against him and the 2600+ players would
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; be expected to win over 99% of the time.

<br><blockquote type=cite>BTW, how does dreaming up ludicrous cheating scenarios help create a
<br>statistically significant number of games?
<br></blockquote>
<br>It is, as I have pointed out before, unreasonably of you to suggest
<br>that I am in some way deficient for failing to provide statistical
<br>evidence of the effect of something that has never been tried.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>I never requested statistical evidence. But the fact that you
<br>haven't provided <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>&nbsp; evidence is telling.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>You sound like someone who is desperate for these experiments not to
<br>go forth, lest they prove you wrong. Seriously, why is that?&nbsp; Why
<br>are you so attached to the status quo that you are willing to make
<br>irrational and false arguments to preserve it?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Please stop trying to side-track and personalize the discussion by
<br>casting aspersions as to my motives.&nbsp; Stop for a moment and see if
<br>your arguments are in any way specific to the matter at hand and you
<br>will see that they are not.&nbsp; That is a sure sign that something is
<br>going wrong.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I think motives are important. I suspect that you really
<br>are not so disconnected from reality as to believe your
<br>argument. More careful consideration on your part, including
<br>an examination of your motives, might let you see the merits
<br>of my arguments as well as put forth sounder objections to them.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>You have proposed a change to the laws of chess.&nbsp; I have suggested
<br>that this change has flaws.&nbsp; You accuse me of irrationality and fear
<br>of change rather than substantively rebutting what I am saying.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I have not proposed changes to the laws of chess, but to scoring
<br>which is external to the game itself. You have not simply
<br>suggested that the proposed changes have flaws (which
<br>would be correct), but claimed a specific flaw, which I believe
<br>I have characterized fairly, as well as have rebutted.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I'm the first to admit that whatever experiments are tried are
<br>bound to have glitches and might not bring the intended
<br>consequences.
<br></blockquote>
<br>On the one hand, you claim to accept that your idea might not work.
<br>On the other hand, anybody who gives an actual reason why your idea
<br>might not work (it makes cheating more profitable than the current
<br>rules) is presenting `irrational and false arguments'.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I would rather see [...] chess played under a mathematically sounder
<br>alternate scoring system.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Please justify your assertion that awarding less than half a point for
<br>a draw is mathematically more sound.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I suppose it is not pure mathematics, but empirically the half point
<br>draw has produced a situation where contestants routinely
<br>avoid playing real games. Imagine, for example, we awarded a
<br>draw the value of 0.9. What do you predict that change would
<br>make to the game, and would it improve the game? Same
<br>arguments apply to 0.5.
