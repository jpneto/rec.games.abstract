-- CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ---

Open Championship Computer-Roshambo 2003
========================================

As part of the 8th Computer Olympiad, taking place in Graz, Austria, on
November 23 - 27, 2003, an open competition in Computer-RoShamBo will be
organized. The competition will run on a computer located at IKAT in
Maastricht, the Netherlands. Participation is free of charge.

We especially encourage students to participate in the competition.


What is RoShamBo?
-----------------

RoShamBo is a game played all over the world. In Japan, where it is very
popular, it is called Jan Ken and in the USA and England they call it
Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game is quite simple. Two players sit facing each
other and on a sign they first stamp three times with the right fist in the
open left hand and then they simultaneously make a gesture with their right
hand.

There are three different gestures:
 "Rock" - closed fist;
 "Paper" - stretched hand;
 "Scissors" - two fingers spread.

Now it is time to determine who wins. The following rule applies: The
scissors are stronger than paper because they can cut paper. The rock beats
the scissors because it blunts the scissors. Paper beats the rock because
paper can cover the rock. If both players make the same gesture, nobody wins

Of course, the game is performed a number of times, because the thrill of
the game is to predict what the opponent will do the next time.

In Japan the game is often played at the dinner table or, as a gimmick, to
determine who has to do a certain job. The Japanese then say "Jan Ken Pon!"
to start the game.


Computer-RoShamBo!
------------------
The purpose of the competition is to write a Java program that can play
RoShamBo. Your program will play against all other participating programs
and the program winning the most games is the champion.

We have chosen the programming language Java because many students learn
Java in school and it is independent from the operating system
(Windows,Linux, Apple, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to put your
contribution
as a Java-applet on a website for everybody who wants to play against it.

When you write a RoShamBo program you must keep the following in mind. From
a mathematical point of view, the best approach is to play randomly (with
equal probability on the three gestures). In the long term, nobody can beat
you then. However, this does not help you in a competition like this,
because we do not play long enough. Therefore,
you should try to predict the moves of your opponent and react on that, or
you should try to be smarter than your opponent.


How do you participate?

instructions. On this site you will also find links to background
information on computer-RoShamBo.

Inform us as soon as possible, before September 1, 2003, by an email to
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:roshambo@icga.org">roshambo@icga.org</a> that you are going to participate in the competition
(subject: participation roshambo).

Your submission should be received before November 1, 2003, the competition
will be held on November 21 and the champions are honoured on November 23 at
the Computer Olympiad in Graz.
