Those last three words were a bit redundant, surely?   ;-)

Anyway, a major problem with accreditation of game design,
(not that anyone worries about it but a certain individual who
laughably heads up all his game presentations with "please don't
change the name or leave MY name out!"), is that games can be
changed in different aspects, so it's difficult to try and say
who discovered what.  As usual, academic attributional courtesy
tends to apply; successfully, until some paranoid berk with
a hugely inflated sense of self-worth poisons the patch.

It is a particular problem in connection games; where there
is both a global ("what is to ultimately connect to what") and
a local (combinatoric topology) aspect.  It is really a thankless
task to try to decide which is the more important.  So why bother?
Only one person here cares about it.  (He who puts paranoid
conditions on his published games!)

For a connection game that works quite will with NO grid:

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's a great idea for a game!  But alas it fails where all
attempts to construct continuous-region games fail - it is,
ultimately, an ill-defined game, which means an undefined game.
To define it properly, one would have to cover the board with
pixel-like cells to determine unambiguously what was connected
to what, (which is probably done in the screen implewmentation!),
which just makes it a grid game again, with an enormous grid.

It would be an intriguing game-design challemge (HELLO NICK!),
to design a game which was "clearly" a connection game "in spirit",
but had no grid at all!  I'm not sure how one could go about it
in view of the remarks above, but there seems no a priori problem.

It is my experience and belief that a strong Hex player, having

Indeed!  I suspect this is very likely to be the case.
And it is a telling argument in the debate.  I would make it
a "strong belief" of my own, if I indulged in having beliefs,
which I do not.   ;-)

This is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the case when moving to a non-trivalent grid.

That may well be the case if you lump ALL non-locally-hex games
together; but if again one restricts to, say, FCFC quad games,
(or any other single protocol), the same masters would again
shine at them all.  This tends to support your main point, though.

That Atoll is "fundamentally different from hex" because it has
8 (or more) goals rather than 4 is an odd assertion for you
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, there's no denying the Atol idea is a good one, and the
graphics on that Dutch site are great.  But like everything else,
it can be extended.  Joao Neto and myself are already playing
variants "Hexatol" and "Octatol" (sounds like a medicinal petrol!),
which have respectively 12 and 16 border colour-zones, compared
to Atol's 8.  Same basic idea, and all with local-hex.

The win-criteria in these two are simple but intriguing!
In Hexatol the winner is whoever connects 2 opposite zones
OR three alternating-Y zones, pretty common idea by now;
and in Octatol it is whoever joins two opposite groups
OR makes a Y that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>prevents<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the opponent from doing this.
This pro-&amp;-con criterion, (or at least wording), surprisingly
keeps the game win-loss complementary, and I am quite pleased
with this minor discovery!  :)

Locally-quad versions (whatever protocol) are also possible,
obviously, and Joao and I already play QuadrAtol as well.
(This time the prefix refrs to the local rather than global aspect!)

No doubt you-know-who will eventually claim that all these are
really his own inventions, or at least clearly "implied by them". ;)

Alas, such strict mathematical ideas do not apply precisely

The fundamental goal of hex is to connect one's goal areas.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True.  But this is not the whole story, as the case of "Free Y"
shows - this is clearly a connection game, but there are NO
personally-owned areas at all!  Actually it's also the case in Y,
though there is at least some approach to actual areas, there.

The number of goals is no more or less a fundamental change

This is rather sweeping, and I suspect rather untenable.
