Nonsense.  There has to be a first time for anything.

No there doesn't and the point is irrelevant anyway.  If and when
something happens for the first time, such a statement of surprise
would be any normal person's reaction.

Because no one
has run 1500 meters in less than 3:25, would you say, "People are not

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's not a good comparison.  Shaving one second off the world record
is not the same kind of qualitative change as in the chess example and
it certainly wouldn't startle anyone.  But suppose somebody suddenly
ran the 1500 meters in say 2:00.  That would be the kind of huge
qualitative change that would make any reasonable person say "People
are not supposed to be able to run 1500 meters in 2:00." (or say
essentially the same thing in different words).

It's silly.

You're the one being silly.  So silly in fact that I'm seriously
wondering whether you even understand the sentence in question.
It's as if you are removing it from context and attaching some
other meaning to it.

As I previously mentioned, it wasn't really a sacrifice for strategic

This is a nonexistent distinction.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

On the contrary, it's a very real distinction.
You may not be at the level of play where you can appreciate the
difference between strategy and tactics but there is definitely
a difference between choosing a move for strategic reasons and
choosing a move for tactical reasons.

Suppose you are playing a game (chess, go, whatever) against a
computer and further suppose you are not aware of any instances of a
computer program using strategy X.  Now suppose that much to your
surprise, the computer program uses strategy X.  Your reaction might
be

"Whoa!  I didn't know a computer program could do THAT!"

or equivalently,

"What?!  Computer programs aren't supposed to be able to do THAT!"

The two statements aren't equivalent.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

???
Nonsense.
If you really believe that, then you do not understand the above
statements.  They both are expressions of surprise that a computer
program did something that you didn't think they could do.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But I wouldn't say either one.
I know that, in fact, a computer program can do anything that a human can
do. It's only a matter of time, whether it's happened yet or not.

FYI, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>NOBODY<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> in the entire world knows that.  The very top people in
the world who have devoted decades of their lives to this issue cannot
agree on whether that is true or not.  The only way I know to prove
such a statement would be to show that humans are equivalent to Turing
Machines but nobody has even the foggiest idea of how to do that.
If you really have a proof of this claim, then write it up and submit
to an appropriate journal.  Believe me you would become world famous.

As I mentioned in my last post, you are saying something very similar
to what I am saying.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But that would not at all be the same as saying they are not "supposed"

"not at all" ???
Again our statements have only a small shade of difference in meaning.
You are reading some other meaning into my statement which is quite
simply not there.  I don't know what incorrect meaning you are
ascribing to my statement and frankly I don't care because no matter
what it is, you are arguing against a position I do not hold.

There doesn't seem to be much point in continuing this any further
and I for one am inclined to drop it.
