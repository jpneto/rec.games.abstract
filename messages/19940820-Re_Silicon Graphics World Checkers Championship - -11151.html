Hey guys I hate to ruin your party but this discussion group
is rec.games.chess, that's right <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>chess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> NOT checkers. You've
wasted enough bandwidth already and I have better things to do
than edit my kill file. Could you please move this f*cking
thread elsewhere? Thank you.

1) You have cross-posted your article to rec.games.abstract and

  you do a real bad job in representing rec.games.chess.

My newsreader did not act predictably when I posted my response. The problem
with the newsreader will be corrected. My apologies to those readers of the
other newsgroups who have been courteous and constrained their postings to
the appropriate newsgroups. Most reasonable people would correctly infer
that I did not intend my response to be cross-posted. However this may not
be such a bad thing as it gets the point across to those who have been
cavalier with their cross-postings.

Wrong. RGC has a charter and this charter does not include checkers. At the
very least any checker related material should be posted to the appropriate
checkers discussion group. Please don't try to rationalize cross-postings
which are clearly inappropriate because you have an interest in the subject
matter. If no discussion group exists for your subject of interest you have
several options: create a discussion group or form a private discussion group.
The latter was done in the case of the CBUFF utilities, clearly it would not
have been fair to the RGC readership to heap all the CBUFF discussions on them.

My rather caustic response was entirely appropriate because these checkers
posters displayed a blatant disregard for the charter of this newsgroup. The
last time a checkers thread emerged the checkers posters were politely asked
to move the thread elsewhere (not by myself). Maybe if I would have at least
seen some indication that an attempt was made to seek an appropriate channel
for these checkers postings I would not have become so irritated. My apologies
to the usual chess posters/readers on RGC for having to endure this, but none
will be extended to the checkers posters. This is my last word on the subject.
