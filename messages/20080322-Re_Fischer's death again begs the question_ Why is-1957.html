<br>Why do you assume Chess should be the same as most other things? 
Surely one of the attractive features may be it is very different 
to most human competition?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>It's especially
<br>offensive that this occurs in the last round of every major
<br>tournament -exactly when, in ordinary non-chess competitions,
<br>the drama is at its highest.

<br>When was the last time there was a decent FIFA World Cup Final? 
Most of the really good matches come earlier in the competition 
IME.&nbsp; The problem becomes there's too much to lose, even though 
there's everything to win.&nbsp; That is not limited to Chess.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>I don't know what sort of chess you play, but I don't know

<br>Irrelevant. Nothing says that they have to play the same
<br>openings against weaker players as they do against their peers,
<br>and frankly I'd be surprised if that were the case.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I think you missed Andy's point, which is people aren't always 
looking for draws: they'll play according to what they think they 
can get, to the best of their ability.&nbsp; You don't win by drawing 
every match, and you don't win by letting your opponents run away 
from you with big-value wins when you lose.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>In what sense is watching live football "extreme"?&nbsp; The
<br>fact remains that live chess, unlike most [all?] physical sports,
<br>and many mind sports, is utterly opaque to any spectator who is
<br>not of comparable ability with the players.&nbsp; That's not to say
<br>that we can't have TV programs about it;&nbsp; but it's not going to
<br>have mass spectator appeal.
<br></blockquote>
<br>So what? It can have more appeal than it currently does.
<br>It can appeal to amateur chessplayers, at least.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I suspect Andy's suggestion that the highest levels, at least in 
real time, are opaque to pretty much everyone outside of the Big 
Boys (and Girls).&nbsp; The Go club I'm in has hosted the Scottish Open 
for the last couple of years, and it's been won by (amateur) 5 Dan 
Chinese players.&nbsp; Their play is open for inspection by anyone else 
at the tournament, but there aren't crowds around their table 
because to the mere Kyu players it's not really very clear what's 
going on.&nbsp; I (10 Kyu) can look at a game well underway and have not 
the faintest idea who is winning.&nbsp; Considerably stronger friends 
report the same.&nbsp; I don't see any particular reason chess should be 
different in essence, because like Go it's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> deep.&nbsp; And these 
guys wouldn't hold a candle to the <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> good professionals 
themselves.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>My experience is that when the kids see the adult game, they
<br>don't like what they see. I think the draw-worshipping
<br>culture is certainly a component of that. But I certainly agree
<br>that there are other factors.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Primarily it has ceased to be a game in the broad sense of "fun 
pastime".&nbsp; My nephew was a pretty good player for his age, last 
time I played him I had to think pretty hard, so I was taking time 
over my moves.&nbsp; By "taking time" I mean up to, oh, maybe a couple 
of minutes each move at the very outside.&nbsp; It drove him up the 
wall, he couldn't <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>believe<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> I was taking so long!&nbsp; Kids don't like 
serious Chess so much because they have a more limited attention 
span than a Chess GM.&nbsp; It's not the game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>they<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play because hardly 
anything happens, even in vicous games played with the knives out 
on both sides.&nbsp; They just sit there staring at the board instead of 
moving, it's not High Octane Action (by juvenile standards) even if 
they are going for an out and out win.
<br>
<br>To reiterate, I'm not saying your idea won't or can't work, but I 
suspect two things:
<br>
<br>- the game is not as broken as you seem to think;
<br>- your attempts to fix it probably won't change much.
