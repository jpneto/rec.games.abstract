It's hard to determine a precise stack size for Monkey Queen.  Many of the
burn through games ended up with move totals in the low fifties.  To me that
seems a little short and I think stack sizes 13 or 14 would be better than
12.  But I'm going to leave stack size as an open option and suggest 12 to
14 checkers.

In the applet the initial stack on D6 raises off the board,
graphically, so space must be allocated for that size. Just to be on
the safe side, I've changed the graphics so that the applet now will
'hold' 16 men on the top row (or any row of course, but the top row is
where it raises off the board).

A Queen, especially a high one, will also hide a baby that's on the
square immediately behind it. Barring a diagonal display, this cannot
be remedied, but the applet will allow to flip the board.
Nevertheless, with a baby on C1, a large Queen on C2 and a baby on C3,
one of the babies will always be hidden behind its Queen.
