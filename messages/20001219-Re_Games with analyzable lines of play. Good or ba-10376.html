It depends on what you mean by solve.
It may be possible to prove Chess is a draw (or win for one side) with best
play, without having to look at every possible position.

For example consider Nim played with the one stack containing 10^100000000000
stones. There are more possible ways to play this game than can ever be
analysed explicitly. But I know that the right move is to take the whole stack
(under the normal win condition).

Let me echo Bruno's comments. I've seen some posts suggesting that the
only way to solve chess is to store the best position for all possible
boards. That is not actually the usual definition of solving a game.

I would suggest that if I could come up with an algorithm that would 
guarantee at least a draw for white (we know that such an algorithm
exists) then chess would be solved. To do so, I do not need to store
as massively vast a set of games as previous posts have implied.

One poster says that 6-piece endings can currently be stored in 32 G.
Adding another piece at worst will multiply that by 58 (spaces) x
5 (possible pieces at the new square) so we could store 8-piece
endings in 3 petabytes; knowing how combinatorics work, I'd expect
that the actual number would be less than a petabyte. Expensive, but
doable now. By 2020, would 10-piece storage be impossible?

So now all the algorithm would have to do is to reduce the intial
set of 32 pieces to a subset of the 10-piece solutions that include
no losses. We don't need a general purpose strategy -- which is what
is currently being attempted -- we just want to reduce the game to
a series of piece exchanges that will get us to our solution set.

It is not inconceivable to me that a specific set of openings
(let's store them in another 50 petabytes) could be found that 
give a narrow set of positions from which any good player (i.e.
one at Deep Blue level) can guarantee getting to the 10-piece
solution set we need.

The deeper question than "is it possible?" is "will anyone bother?"
