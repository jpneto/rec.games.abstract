INTRODUCTION  Cancer is a variant of Go.  The two players, Red and
White, each have unlimited stones of their own color.  They also share
an unlimited supply of black, cancer stones.  Draws cannot occur in
Cancer.   Mark Steere designed Cancer in February, 2012.

OBJECT  The object of Cancer is to completely annihilate your
opponent, emptying the board of his color stones.  If your placement
eliminates all red and white stones from the board, you win.  If your
placement eliminates all of your own stones while enemy stones remain
on the board, you lose.

PLAY  Starting with Red, the two players take turns adding a single
stone to the board.  On his first turn, Red must place a red stone.
 Likewise for White.  On subsequent turns, a player must place either
a stone of his own color or a cancer stone, subject to restrictions,
but not both.

CANCER STONES  The cancer (black) stones are permanent.  Once played,
they remain in place for the duration.  A cancer stone can only be
used to capture or to fill an eye.

CAPTURE WITH CANCER  Capturing placements, i.e. placements that
deprive one or more groups of all their liberties, can only be made
with cancer stones.  Groups of both players' colors can be captured be
either player (by placing a cancer stone).  I.e. suicides and suicide
kills can happen.

When multiple groups are bounded (deprived of all liberties) by a
placement, all such groups are removed immediately following the
placement, regardless of the groups' colors.  If a temporarily bounded
group is unbounded by the removal of a neighboring, enemy group, said
temporarily bounded group is still removed.

FILL EYES WITH CANCER  An eye can be filled with a cancer stone by
either player or with a stone of the surrounding color by that color's
player.   If an eye is a group's last remaining liberty, only a cancer
stone can be use to fill it, killing the surrounding group.

NO PASSING  Passing is not allowed in Cancer.   Players will always
have a placement available and must make one.

PIE  Cancer makes use of the pie rule.
