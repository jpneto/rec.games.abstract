Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Thank you. To answer your question, I'm an American.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Great! I've been in your country for 7 months and lived in communes.
America has many faces...

There seems to be two choices as how one can handle this.  First, one can
essentially reverse the board, giving the Lower Side four groups of negative
pieces and the Upper Side two groups of negative pieces.  This would give the
second player a more advantageous set-up than the first player.  The question
is the first player advantage that significant that it warrants giving the
second player such a strong edge?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I tested the reversed set-up. First, White won still all the games (!),
later it was  Black. It's not easy to reach a definite conclusion,
however, I suspect that Black has an advantage if the game is played well.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Second, one could give the Lower and Upper Sides the same set-up of four
groups of negative pieces.  This change would balance both sides and
would force the use of more positive pieces, which is more in the spirit
of the game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I do not really understand what you exactly mean with "the use of more
positive pieces".

Polarity will always remain in practice a variant of Give-away Checkers.
Whatever you chose as the initial set-up, getting rid of your own
negative pieces will always be far more easier than to capture your
opponent's positive pieces because it is far more difficult to
defend against an attacking negative piece (which wants to commit
suicide) than to defend one's own positive pieces which are attacked.
This doesn't depend on the initial set-up. Basically Polarity is a race
game: you try to get your negative pieces killed as fast as possible (there
are only 6, so it's not good to fall behind in the race). The positive
pieces are usually only used to get your negative pieces killed. I had only
one game, where a player had one negative piece left and had to play
cautiously, but he intentionally caused the situation himself because he
sacrificed all his other positive pieces to gain the lead in the race, and
he knew many moves ahead that he would win by losing all his negative pieces,
while having just one positive piece left.


However, just for theory, who wins when a player
loses his last negative and positive piece in the same move (by multiple
capture)? Is this a draw?

The question now is the first-player advantage still too strong?

Must be tried out...
