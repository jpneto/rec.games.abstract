I hope I have explained to you why I do not consider the points you have
made to be impurities. After doing fighting in armour, and in some instances
with obstacles in the way (such as fighting in woods and on bridges), I
consider Hnefatafl to be a very accurate simulation of real fighting given
the simple rules it has.

The problem now is that you are violating the central
 tenet of "abstractness".  The rules of the game should
 be able to stand on their own merits as a consistent
 system without reference to "accurate simulation".

By using real world symbols to create rule exceptions
 (such as the throne), you are adding impurities.

In Hnefatafl's defense:  numerous variants of this game
 exist, with board size (and therefore number of pieces)
 being the variable.  They are for the most part fair to
 both attacker + defender.  The box set "Best of Dragon
 Magazine Games" contains rules for several of these
 games.
