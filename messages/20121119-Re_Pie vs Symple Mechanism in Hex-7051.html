It's kind of ridiculous that this discussion is happening in two separate spaces, but what the hell, I'll participate, since this thread raises some interesting questions. 

I too have a bit of a gripe with Symple, but it's much, errrm, simpler than the questions about balance: it's that having to place like 8 stones per turn or more on some turns feels awkward and can lead to overwhelming analysis paralysis, for me anyway. I don't think I can really comfortably go more than 4 stones per turn in a placement game, and even that's pushing it.
