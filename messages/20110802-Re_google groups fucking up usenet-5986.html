Get a newsreader, Nick.  There's nothing technically wrong with
rec.games.abstract.  There are no delays, whatsoever.  All of my posts
appear instantaneously, without fail.

The problem is google groups.  Rec.games.abstract is not primarily a google
group.  It's a big-8 usenet group.  Rec.games.abstract existed long before
google groups.

Usenet is different from the web.  Google groups is simply a gateway to
usenet for people who are too stupid to use a newsreader, and can only surf
the web.  No offense to you in particular, Nick, but that's essentially the
problem many of us are having.

There's no place to move it.  There's Christian Freeling's bloviation thread
in the Arimaa forum with Omar breathing down your neck.  And there's the
yahoo group, abstractgames.  Joao is a good moderator, as far as moderators
go, but...  it's still a moderated yahoo group.  Abstractgames has stagnated
for years and I don't expect it to come back to life.  It's become a
wasteland for losers like Richard Hutnik.

Yes, google groups is annoying is hell.  When you post something via google
groups, I see it immediately with my newsreader.  (I use Newsrover though
there are other newsreaders.)

Bizarrely, even though I see your post immediately with my newsreader, it
may be a couple of days before <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> see it.  Google groups can actually
hide your own post from you for days after instantaneously passing it on to
usenet.
