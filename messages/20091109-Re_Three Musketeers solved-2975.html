Johannes Laire, this is why one should not touch Mark Steere's games

I've spent enough time online that I've learned to just laugh at
everything. :)
Fortunately there are more than enough games designed by others to
choose from.

Besides, I just noticed that MS is very hostile towards people
changing
the rules of his games. Given that he's not a good player himself,
there is
probably room for improvement in many of his games, so discouraging
experimenting with variations doesn't seem like a good idea to me. In
Cephalopod, for example, 5x5 board with 6-sided dice results in way
too
long games (an opinion shared by everyone at Vying Games). But if
that's
how he wants it, great.
