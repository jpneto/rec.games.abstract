My sister taught me a variation of Mastermind that uses
four-letter words.  Each player has a piece of paper on which
he/she writes his/her four-letter word which the other person
has to guess.  The word may not contain double letters.

We alternate taking turns.  I ask you the word "fish", for
example, and you reply "Two" if two of the letters in "fish"
match letters in your word.

I am hoping to present to you as many words as I can that
will cause you to answer "Zero" because then I can cross out
those four letters in my helpful list of the alphabet.

The winner is the first one to guess the other's word.

You can determine for yourself whether finding the four
letters is good enough (like "pots") or whether the guesser
has to say the word exactly (like "stop").  

It's fun to choose words like "onyx" or "gyms" which seem
unlikely in a jumble of leftover letters.

We've played this in a hike in the mountains, having only 
to pull out a scrap of paper and a pencil from our packs.
