It's just a matter of consistency. It doesn't sound logical to me to

Is it? I'd think it is never unbeneficial. Say a life group helps
capturing one or more groups, then the resulting group doesn't need
the removal to live. Area scoring makes the result identical.

It might confuse new players. So I think it's more logical
to establish the 'eye-opener' (nice word) as an automatic mechanism. I
know it's not comparable, but I wouldn't understand it if the rosette
in Medusa only secured life when the player wanted it to, or, more
properly, if players were allowed to pass their turn in Hex or
Havannah.

The Medusa example isn't comparable indeed, and Havannah? It isn't
explicitly mentioned either way, but as far as I'm concerned a pass
isn't illegal.
It's an approach issue I think. I can see the logic of your argument,
but I'd rather allow something that isn't 'unbeneficial' than making
it mandatory.

(Footnote: When I first read the word 'eye-opener', it reminded me the
unpleasant gadget which kept Malcolm McDowell's eyes open in that
scene from Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.)

Yes I saw A Clockwork Orange again, a while ago. These actors keep
getting younger!
