Chinook is now the "man-machine" world champion [...]

    What a swell victory.  Chinook is "world champion" without winning a
single game.  USUALLY a challenger has to have a + score to claim the title.
    Resigning the match sounds like typical Tinsley sportsmanship.  After
all, in the previous match, he bent over backwards to give Chinook a chance,
then played under conditions that were highly favorable to the machine ---
which after all never suffers from fatigue.
    Too bad the Chinook team doesn't have such sportsmanship.  IMO the match
should have been declared a draw with the champion retaining his title until
his health improved enough for a rematch.  Tinsley gave you guys every
possible break, and IMO you're just taking advantage of his overdeveloped
sense of fair play.  Guess that's just another area where machines are
superior, they don't suffer from that human weakness.

This is not the way we wanted the match to end.  While we wish the
best for Tinsley's health, nevertheless, we are all very, very
disappointed.

    But you can console yourselves with your undeserved and meaningless title.
