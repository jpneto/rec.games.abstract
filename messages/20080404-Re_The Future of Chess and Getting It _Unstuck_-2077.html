I have never seen anyone provide a single bit of data in
support of the theory that chess' popularity is near some
inherent limit. Holding that belief, given that high level
chess has a number of obvious defects, is nothing more
than a mindless defense of the status quo.

I believe, after reading various accounts, that Chess' popularity had
been declining for decades before there was a boost inspired by the
famous international competitions, which was then followed by further
decline.  Then the appearance of Chess on the Internet caused a surge
in popularity.

There's the added complication of an ever increasing number of other
quality abstract games to choose from.  But there should be some limit
to Chess' peak popularity.  For example, the percentage of people who
play Chess ten times a year or more, in real life or online, will
never exceed x percent.  I'll hazard a timid guess that x is less than
20.  I don't know how near Chess' popularity is to its limit now, or
even if the peak has already passed, but yes, there should be some
limit.  And there should be a lower limit too.  Chess' popularity,
measured as described, shouldn't drop below y percent over the next
millennium.
