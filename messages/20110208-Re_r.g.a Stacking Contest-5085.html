You hear that Gert?

Oh shut the fuck up Corey.  After Bill Taylor shows up with 200 of his
favorite sockpuppets, Monkey Queen will be dead last by far, and Grabber
will be second to dead last.  What a lovely way to turn a perfectly good
game contest into a popularity contest.  What bullshit.

No you shut the fuck up. I think its reasonable to limit voting to
people who we're already aware of in the abstract games community. I
don't see a problem with that. It's not like people will just come out
of the woodwork to vote for some contest and of course it would be
suspicious if they did. Heck just ban Bill altogether. Kornelliussen
doesn't strike me as the kind of fellow who would use sock-puppets or
even not vote for a game out of spite. If he is that sort of guy I
have nearly as much to fear from him as you do.
