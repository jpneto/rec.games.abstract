Does Mediocrity have a name? asks Corey in part 2.

Yes, Bill Taylor.

But to be fair, Bill at least posted about games, in particular about
the field of move modifiers. That may be an interesting field. If I
were a treasure hunter I wouldn't dig there myself, but I can't
exclude something extaordinary being found there.

But to say:
"this "Sweetheart Modifier" was one of our funnest ideas, though we
haven't as yet extended it to many other games. The field is open!" -
that's Mediocity trying to recycle Flattery.

"Not yet extended it to many other games", that's implying that it
might be an important meta concept and that we're invited to dig out
the hidden treasures now that the field has been 'unlocked'.

Let's hear Bill about Piet Hein and John Forbes Nash (the beautiful
mind from "A Beautiful Mind") who both discovered Hex:
"Great minds, a pity that their treatment of the corners was a bit
clumsy".

Or about Havannah:
"Since corners are a separate case it's 'ugly' to treat them as a
separate case."

However, as soon Bill finds something, anything, it's 'intruiging'.

How did Bill really expose himself? By by replying to the question
about the above statements:
"Do I detect a slight conflict here? Anyway, it's obvious I've stepped
on someone's toes,
so I'll politely apologize and withdraw from this topic."

What does Bill do, in all his politeness? He doesn't address me, he
addresses his perceived admirers at r.g.c.: "Hey guys I've stepped on
someone's toes".

"Someone" - I'm not worth addressing with my name, or even worth
addressing.
And then he bolts out, feeling insulted, feeling attacked, feeling
resentful.

Corey, why do you feel attacked by my characterization of Mediocrity?
Because it took refuge in your group?
