Of course, not having to count is a plus (and I've already said that
too), but I'm not sure whether it's worth it. After all, counting
takes actually much shorter than playing out a Redstone endgame, which
must be monstruous on a full 19x19 board.

To be a devil's advocate here, I doubt there'd be many occasions play
Redstone all the way to the end, since it would become clear who the
winner is long before then.  In this sense, it might be better than
Go, because if you're not sure who won in Go, you have to count,
whereas if you're not sure who won in Redstone, you can just continue
play, which is a more interesting way to find out who won.
