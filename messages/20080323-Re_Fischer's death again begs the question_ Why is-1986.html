<br><blockquote type=cite>By the way, just to inject some actual data on the magnitude of the
<br>draw problem in chess...
<br>
<br><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessgames.com">http://www.chessgames.com</a> has a large database of games, mostly
<br>between strong players.&nbsp; Their `opening explorer'[1] gives win/loss/
<br>draw statistics for the most commonly played openings.&nbsp; Of these, the
<br>moves 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 account for 98.3% of the 460,000
<br>games in the database.&nbsp; Restricting to those four opening moves, we
<br>see that:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; 36.8% of games (167,000) are won by White
<br>&nbsp; 36.6% of games (166,000) are drawn
<br>&nbsp; 26.6% of games (120,000) are won by Black
<br>
<br>We already have 63.4% of games ending in a win by one player or the
<br>other.&nbsp; Is it really necessary to `solve' this `draw problem'?
<br></blockquote>
<br>These statistics are, of course, not representative of the situation when
<br>top GMs play each other.The draw percentage is around 60%-70%
<br>in the world's most prestigious tournaments.
<br>
<br>Since 1981, when it became a world class tournament,
<br>nobody has ever won Linares with more
<br>than 2 losses, but some have won with as
<br>many as 10 draws. 3/4 of the time, the winner's draw percentage
<br>has been at least 50%.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Another issue is this: it is clearly seen that White has an advantage.
<br>White scores, on average, 0.551 points per game, compared to Black's
<br>0.449 points per game.&nbsp; Any system that reduces the score for draws
<br>will make Black's position slightly worse, since he gets more of his
<br>points from draws.&nbsp; The option of giving a third of a point for draws
<br>would give White 0.490 points per game and give Black 0.388: White
<br>goes from scoring 55.1% of the available points to scoring 55.8% of
<br>the points.&nbsp; This effect is smaller than I would have expected.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>This shows that not only is the current scoring
<br>draw-inducing, it is also just plalin unfair. Yet that
<br>fact doesn't seem to deter its defenders, who
<br>seem to relish its defects rather than attempt to
<br>address them.
<br>
<br>For chess to advance, we must abandon the visceral
<br>and illogical reactions. Instead, we must approach
<br>the problem dispassionately and analytically - what
<br>scoring system produces the best chess?&nbsp; We
<br>already know that 1867-rules will lose that
<br>analysis because it has produced such obviously
<br>anti-competitive practices for such a long time
