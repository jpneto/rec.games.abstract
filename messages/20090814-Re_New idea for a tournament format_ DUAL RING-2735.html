<br>Interesting. A few things strike me.
<br>
<br>One is that it would be possible for one individual to play many games and have 
none of them come to conclusion because their opponents keep losing in their 
other simultaneous match. I would imagine it might be frustrating to have your 
game at an interesting point, and then it is called off and a new one set up 
with a new opponent.
<br>
<br>When down to the final three, it seems very open to manipulation. If two players 
agree to stall on their common board (making quick non-threatening moves to save 
time and brain power), they can likely force the third player out on grounds of 
time or by direct win.
<br>
<br>The way of handling ties is likely to be critical, especially as in chess they 
seem relatively common. Letting the tie stand is not much good as it again seems 
to permit alliances, where two players exchange down to a tie, so as to 
concentrate on eliminating their other opponent.
<br>
<br>It is basically a different 'game' from standard FIDE chess just through having 
to play two sides at once. This may make rule changes like "tie = elimination" 
more acceptable, but I can't see regular chess tournaments jumping to use this 
format.
