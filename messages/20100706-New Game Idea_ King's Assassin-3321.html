I just posted this to my (rarely used) game blog:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-idea-kings-assassin">http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-idea-kings-assassin</a>

and I thought I'd repost it here for discussion.  Here goes:

In my quest to design the perfect abstract game, I sometimes modify
existing perfectish games to try to make them perfecter.  I just came
up with a really cool (according to me) idea regarding how to modify
Quoridor, one of the World's Greatest Abstract Games (TM), to double
its awesomeness. The idea is to concoct a cross between Chess and
Quoridor, as follows:

The game is for 2 players only and played with a Quoridor set.  All 4
pawns provided with the set are needed.

1. Each player has two pieces: one King and one Assassin
2. The goal of the game is no longer to reach the opponent's back row,
but instead to reach the opponent's King with your own Assassin.
3. As in Quoridor, on each turn you must choose between placing a wall
and moving your Assassin one space vertically or horizontally.
4. On any turn in which you choose to place a wall, you must (may?)
also move your King one space vertically or horizontally.
5. After you have placed all your walls, your King may no longer move.
6. You can never place a wall such that there are no paths between
your opponent's Assassin and your own King.

I don't know what the starting positions of King's and Pawns should
be.

I've not tested these rules, so there may need to be modified to make
a workable game, but I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> this should work.

I like this because now, instead of trying to reach any of a set of
unmoving squares, you're giving chase.  Your target occupies a single
space and it's moving, ducking behind walls, and you've got to corner
it as quickly as possible.  Cat and Mouse and whatnot.
