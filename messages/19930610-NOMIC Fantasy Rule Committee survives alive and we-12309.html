Since Nomic World has been shut down, the Fantasy Rule Committee is continuing
to function anyway.

As Judge for the current round I hereby open Fantasy Rule Committee membership
to the public at large, beyond the tiny elite of "Registered Nomic Players"
since the registration list does not seem to be maintained any longer.

Work is being done on an automated vote-by-e_mail program (in PERL) so that
Secret Ballots, which seem to be the only feature (aside from playing TAG)
of Nomic-World which canot be moved, say, HERE, can be implemented, and the
current Nomic-World ruleset (all 50K of it) can continue to be further
refined as the apiary nectar of The World's Longest Running Game Of Nomic Aside
 From Legitimate Legislative Bodies.




These are the Round 8 Fantasy Rule Valid Ordinances: 


Ordinance 8001 (Chatham):

Rule of Hypocrisy:
Any subsequently posted fantasy rule must violate any and all 
restrictions it would impose on future fantasy rules.

Ordinance 8002 (Chatham):

Each subsequent fantasy rule A must include an example of a fantasy rule
B that would be valid if A were valid and this rule (this very rule, the
one you are now reading) had not been posted.
                        
Ordinance 8003 (Davidb):

Any future Fantasy Rules Committee Ordinances must be written using words
of only one syllable.  The 8002 mandated example is:
         All new rules must have the word "smile" in them.


People hav until the 16th of june, THE TIME OF DAY AT YOUR OWN RESIDENCE,
to post round 8.1 fantasy ordinances.

Post fantasy ordinances by sending them to The Judge For The Current Round,
currently <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET">DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET</a>.

The winner, i.e. the last player to not lose by posting an invalid ord or
not posting in a sub-round, becomes the judge for the next round.
