I know that a number of abstract games use a hexagonal playing area.  Where
can I buy a basic board (something similar to a wooden GO board) that has a
hexagonal playing area?  The best would be a board with 8 hexes per side.
If I have at least that many, I can just put masking tape around the border
to make the playing six-hex-sided, as some games only require six hexes per
side.  Where can I buy a basic board?  Is there a good game that comes with
such a board that I could then use for other games?  Is a roll-up vinyl mat
another good option?  Where could I get one of those?

Thanks,
Lucinda
