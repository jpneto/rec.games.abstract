Kris clearly has a genius for marketing games.  He's tapped into a
motherlode of bgg me-tooers, championed by none other than Harald
Korneliussun, Gipf cheerleader in chief.  Harald is always first in line to
enter his favorite Gipf games into the latest bgg me-too poll.  The same
Harald Korneliussun who publicly argued that the pie rule confers an
advantage to Player 1 since Player 1 "has more time to study the board". 
The same Harald Korneliussen who accused Christian Freeling of disqualifying
Dave Dyer as a judge <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>one day<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> after Christian Freeling <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>suggested<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Dave

Of course not everyone who likes Gipf games is a total dope.  John McCallion
once handed me a shrink wrapped Yinsh.  It may seem obvious, but a few days
passed before it dawned on me.  The Yinsh gift was supposed to provide me
with inspiration, lol  It was a well intentioned gift but it never left the
shrink wrap and I haven't seen it around for a few years.  I must have
tossed it during a spring cleaning.

Kris's marketing genius doesn't preclude other types of genius, including
game design genius.  People say the gameplay is fabulous for all the Gipf
games, although there always seem to be corresponding mutterings of
shittiness - not enough pieces for advanced beginners, etc.  For me, the
problem is the architecture in the Gipf series, or lack thereof.  There just
seem to be heaps of arbitrary rules.  Even if the gameplay is fabulous, I
couldn't force myself to sit down and play a game that ugly (no offense, but
just IMO).
