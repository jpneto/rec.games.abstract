I find the idea of a random lattice very appealing.  It would provide for
very unusual strategy.  The obvious point about 3-D go, is that a tetrahedral
lattice is both regular and gives each point four neighbors.  I haven't seen
anyone raise this possibility yet.  As for what it would do to the strategy,
who knows?  I'd like to give it a try if anyone comes up with a way. 

The random lattice doesn't require three dimensions.  You can generate the
same network on two dimensions, you'll just have a lot more crossing lines
if you draw it out.

  Exactly what is meant by "randomly generated graph" may be harder to
make precise than you think.  Also, tetrahedrons don't tile 3 space.

Amen on the "randomly generated graph" point (although I did like
the Penrose tile suggestion in another post).  On the "tetrahedrons"
point, I assume that Randy King meant the diamond lattice, where
the connections running out of every
have tetrahedral symmetry.  "Tetrahedrons don't
tile 3-space" is correct, and the Voronoi polyhedra
in the diamond lattice are not tetrahedra, but there is a
definite "tetrahedralness" about the lattice nonetheless. (so that
you can make it out of undistorted, 4-coordinated carbon atoms)

We are faced with the very real possibility that "digital" and

We already have to deal with "flammable"="inflammable", and
"nonadiabatic" (instead of "diabatic") being the antonym of "adiabatic".
So why not? :-)
