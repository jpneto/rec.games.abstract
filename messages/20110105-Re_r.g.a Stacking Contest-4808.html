I hope you can spare a couple of them the disappointments on the road
ahead. They're not all the new Kris Burm, who is a clever inventor of
games that only can be played with specific material and appear
interesting enough to rather buy a copy than improvise one. Judging
from the lasting popularity of some games he obviously delivers the
goods. He will 'end up' fine I hope and I see no reason why he
wouldn't.

Kris Burm wouldn't invent Dameo or Oust, or, if he did, he wouldn't
consider them in commercial terms. And rightly so. Some inventors
invent for other than commecial reasons. They don't 'end up like Jim
Albea' either.

So generally speaking I appreciate your intentions, just don't try to
'save' those who have no commercial aspirations and just try to make
good games. They will 'end up' having made a couple of good games.
