Conversely, Luis, why are you inclined to believe that such a large, unoccupied area would lead to a draw?

I'm more inclined to believe that it could possibly lead to a draw than the opposite, but it's just speculation. My point is that turn alternation on a 3x3 board without colored board edges would necessarily end with the 'A' cell empty if that pattern were formed. That looks troublesome, but, of course, it doesn't prove anything. It might be the case that some of the pieces around 'A' will necessarily end up being part of the same group, which will enable playing on 'A', but maybe several occurrences of that 3x3 pattern on the board at the same time would prevent that. I'm not sure.

(Anyway, Trisq 2.0 seems better now.)

Why not look at smaller areas?  A draw would occur with only two spaces remaining, right?  I would look at various permutations of two remaining spaces and surrounding tokens on tiny boards - barely large enough to contain the two spaces and maybe a few surrounding tokens.

Yes, but why would there have to be only two spaces remaining? It's possible that a draw pattern exists with more than two spaces remanining but not with exactly two. Take Orcoon, for instance. I found draws of size 2x3, 3x3, 3x4, 4x4 and 5x5. The 4x4 draw had already 4 spaces which were unplayable for both players. If you ban all the smaller draw patterns, you'll ensure that the smallest draw has at least 4 spaces remaining.

Logically, if a draw can't occur in a tiny area then it also can't occur in a larger area that will eventually shrink to a smaller area.  Right?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't think that's right. Take Orcoon again. If you ban the draw patterns except the 5x5 one, you'll ensure that draws can't occur on areas smaller than 5x5, yet the game is still draw susceptible.
