I've got "Sentinel" for the BBC B, and the Atari ST. I've never seen
it for the IBM PC, but if I did, I'd buy it.

It's a great game with eerie background music. The point of the game
is to leapfrog through 10,000 landscapes (skipping about 30 each
time) to reach the top. Beating one landscape means you get a code for 
another landscape further up. At 30 levels a skip and ~10 minutes a level,
that's ~334 levels you actually have to play, and ~56 hours of playing time.

I got up to ~level 8,000 on the BBC B, and when I started the Atari
version, I tried using the BBC B codes to start from that level. &lt;grrr!&gt;
The Atari version had all-new codes, and I had to start from scratch
again! I'm almost afraid to check out an IBM PC version.

The game play was tricky, but once you'd mastered it, straightforward.
The levels didn't get progressively more difficult up to level 10,000.
As I remember, after ~ level 100 they were just randomly difficult.

I regard it as a classic: it's right up there with Elite, Archipelagoes,
Tower Of Bable, ...

Further details of the game structure &amp; gameplay available on request :-)

I am looking for a game that I heard about several years ago, and want to
find out if it ever made it over to IBM (or even Mac).  Please note
cross-posting.

        Several years ago, a French gaming magazine, the now defunct Jeux
et Strategie, had a gushing review about an Amiga game called Sentinel. 
Supposedly, the player was some sort of "creature" roaming/ telepathing
around an abstract park.  Each park was gaurded by a Sentinel that rotated
on the highest point of the park, and you job was to get to it before it
saw you (by telepathing to it/ and building stuff... I never really
understood how...).

        First, has anyone ever heard of the game; but more importantly,
has anyone heard of it or something similar on IBM?  

        Please mail me personally, since I do not read these newsgroups. 
(Sorry :-(..)

BUT POST IT ANYWAY. I WANT TO KNOW TOO.
