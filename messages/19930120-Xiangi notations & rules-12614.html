Some time ago there was a discussion about different notations in Chinese chess
in rec.games.chess. A suggestion to be approved by Asian Xiangqi Federation 
(AXF) was mentioned. Well, did they approve it?

The first Finnish association for Chinese chess was established not long ago.
We are planning to have algebraic notation as a standard in Finland. However,
if I send any games to this group, I will use the AXF notation, right?

I haven't noticed any discussion about pros and cons of different
notations. Here are some personal opinions of mine:

Chinese notations (eg. AXF suggestion):
     + compatible with Chinese game scores

     - ambiguous (eg. three or more pawns on the same file!)
       This is of course a theoretical minus. The following one is much more
       important.
     - difficult to find the mistake if you are following a game score and
       make a mistake in moving a piece. It is frustrating to start the game
       from beginning. If the mistake is in the score, it might be pretty much
       impossible to go through the game. It is very difficult to say whether
       the mistake is yours or in the game score (the poorer you play, the more
       difficult it is!).

Algebraic notations:
     + unambiguous
     + self-corrective: if you make a mistake in moving a piece, it is easy to
       back up the score and correct. Or if there is a misprint in the game
       score, it doesn't accumulate as it does in chinese notations.

     - incompatible with Chinese game scores

I have some experience of both types of notations, so I think I know what
I'm talking about.

There were some games in rec.games.chess, too, but I haven't seen any lately.
I would be interested eg. in endgame lessons, problems etc.

Does anybody have the exact!? rules concerning repetitive moves?
