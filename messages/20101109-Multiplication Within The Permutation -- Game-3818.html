This is a game for any plural number of players. Let the number of
players be m.

Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper, where n = k*m + 1, k is some
integer &gt;= 3.

In the first part of the game, players take turns placing x's in empty
squares of the grid, one x per turn, such that no more than one x is
in each row and in each column of the grid.

After exactly n x's are placed in the grid, the first part of the game
is over.

The second part of the game starts with a 1 being placed in the
leftmost square with an x in it. Players then take turns.
On the jth move (starting at move # 1) of the second part of the game,
the moving player places a (j+1) in any square with an x and without a
number already in it.
He/she gets added to her/his score:
|x(j)-x(j+1)| * |y(j)-y(j+1)|,
where x(j) is the number of squares from the bottom of the grid where
the square with the j in it is located, and y(j) is the number of
squares from the left side of the grid where the square with the j in
it is located.

So, what we are adding to the moving player's score (the score of the
player writing a j+1 in a square) is the product of {the change in
horizontal distance between the squares with j and j+1 in them} and
{the change of vertical distance between the squares with j and j+1 in
them}.

When the nth x is numbered with a n = m*k+1, the game is over.

Largest score wins.
