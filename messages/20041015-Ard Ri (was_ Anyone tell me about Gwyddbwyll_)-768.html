Where are the references to this?  I see it mentioned on a lot of web
sites, and David Parlett has reproduced the layout commonly associated
with it, in The Oxford History of Board Games.  But I can't find any
contemporary references to the game.  I'm starting to think that it's a
modern invention.

As an aside, the layout seems to me to create a game biased to an
unplayable level in the favour of the attackers.  I've reproduced a
partial game below that shows how easily white (the king) can be
trapped:

		Black			White
	1.      G5-F5                   C5-C6
	2.      A5-C5xC6                C3-B3
	3.      C1-C3xB3/C4             E5-E6
	4.      F5-E5xD5/E6             E3-E2
	5.      G3-E3xD3/E2/E4

I can't see any way for white to prevent this.  It's no different if
white moves first; all eight available moves are simple rotations of one
another.  A game where players are restricted to moving to adjacent
squares prolongs the suspense, but doesn't seem to allow the defenders a
way to break through.

Is there any way to make this game playable, or any references to show
it really existed, or is it a dead-end as far as research and
reconstruction go?
