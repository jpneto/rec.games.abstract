The World Othello Championships took place last week, Wednesday November 4th
until Saturday November 7th.  After a 13-round Swiss tournament, four
players continued on to the semi-finals.  David Shaman of Great Britain
and Marc Tastet of France advanced to the Finals, and Tastet beat Shaman
2-0 in the best of 3 match.

This is only the third time a non-Japanese has won the World Championships!

The team competition was won by Great Britain.

I'll post more results and game transcripts when I get them (unless someone
else is able to post them first).

Congratulations to Marc and all the participants!

Colin Springer
