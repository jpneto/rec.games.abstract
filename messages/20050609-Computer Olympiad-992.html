CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
10th Computer Olympiad
Taipei, Taiwan
In close cooperation with the Chang Jung University, the International
Computer Games Organisation (ICGA) organises the 10th Computer Olympiad
in Taipei, Taiwan. The organising committee consists of: Dr. H.H.L.M.
Donkers, Dr. M. Greenspan, Mrs. J.W. Hellemons (chair), Professor T-s
Hsu, Professor H.J. van den Herik, and Mrs. M. Tiessen. Many
tournaments are envisaged. Below 26 different games are listed for
which a program can be submitted.

A few remarks are in order. (1) The game of chess is not included since
a separate World Computer Chess Championship (the 13th WCCC) is held in
Reykjavik, Iceland from August 13 to August 21, 2005. (2) The game of
Renju, claimed to be solved, is still welcome since we have not seen a
fully-operational program on internet that plays perfectly. (3) We are
willing to host more games, such as Ataxx, Clobber, Dvonn, Mediocrity,
Onyx, Tamsk, TwixT and Zèrtz but we do not know of the existence of
adequately playing programs. We are awaiting suggestions and proposals
of programmers before we include them in the official list given above.

For each game a tournament will take place provided that at least two
programs enter the tournament for that particular game. The detailed
tournament schedule will not be announced until the closing date for
entries which is July 15, 2005. Notification of entry acceptation will
be given before August 1, 2005. Gold, Silver and Bronze medals will be
awarded to the leading programs in each tournament.

The Tournament Directors of the Computer Olympiad will be: H.J. van den
Herik and M. Greenspan (for Pool). The head of the local organization
is Professor S.-C Hsu. He is supported by a local team. For details we
refer to <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/olympiad2005/">http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/olympiad2005/</a>.

The rules of the 10th Computer Olympiad will be published on this
website.


The entry fees for the other tournaments are as follows:

Amateur:
  25
Semi-professional:
  100
Professional:
  250

A participant is expected to be ICGA member in good standing ( 40).

"Amateur": programmers who have no commercial interest in their
program, and are not professional game programmers. Applications for
amateur classification must supply information to justify their claim.

"Semi-professional": Any program submitted by an employee or associate
from a games-programming company. The program's name must not be
derived from or similar to a commercial product.

"Professional": A program whose name is the same as or derived from a
commercial product.

Any entry received after August 1, 2005 will be subject to a penalty
fee, doubling the above fees.
