Games which UCT excel at seem to be reduction games where the moves
tend to diminish and/or there is some "force" driving the game to an
end.
As an observation, many (if not most) of Mark Steere's games seem to
have that property so perhaps Mark has created fertile territory for
UCT :).

Contrast that with positional games which can stalemate.  I'll make an
arguable and brash statement that, in general, if a game can end in a
draw (typically with pieces cycling around the board to no end), then
it's likely not a good fit for UCT since I believe UCT will have a
hard time finding the narrow line(s) of play which leads to a win.

Just your luck Mark, with a style based on hard finitude, cyclophobia
end the eradication of draws from the face of the universe, you end up
making cannon fodder for MC/UTC evaluation, while those damn cylic
misconceptions dodge the bullet ;-)
