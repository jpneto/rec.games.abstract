I'd consider allowing that, otherwise the mechanism would hamper
itself, which is mostly an indication that something is wrong.

Or maybe you can take "slide &amp; unite" as the basis in the first place:
"A black stone may strike if the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>resulting black group<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> equals the
striking distance."
That way the original target can be one or more separate white stones
or groups, with or without black ones attached.

I think this might make the strike distance too large too quick which
is what I was avoiding.  I see though how this would solve the problem
that you were concerned with.

On another note, I got a chance to play Corey in the sandbox at iggc.
He had an interesting suggestion.  The "helper" stones could be the
number of stones in the group adjacent to where the striking stone
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>left<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it's position as opposed to where it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>arrived<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

I will play test both versions (as well as a few more) over the next
few days and try to determine what the difference is between them and
which one lends itself better to the game.  I also get the feeling
that a base7 hexhex board might end up being the standard size.
