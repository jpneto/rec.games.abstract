Hi all,

In a shop yesterday I saw a noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) set where the
pieces are bulls and bears.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.bizaar.co.uk/acatalog/Bears___Bulls.html">http://www.bizaar.co.uk/acatalog/Bears___Bulls.html</a>

On the box it said "This game is for adults", although there was no sexual
content. The idea baffled me - can they really make money selling a noughts
and crosses set for adults? I am not sure what I would think if I visited an
adult friend and they said "lets play noughts and crosses"..... and then
pulled out an expensive brushed steel set. A lot of people have more money
than sense, but I can think of no better way to advertise the fact.
Incidentally, I think the shop price was a lot lower than the 20 quid
charged at the website above, but at any price it's a lot dearer than the
usual noughts and crosses set, i.e. a pencil and paper.

The shop also sold a draughts set using the same bulls and bears, but it
didn't look possible to create a king by stacking two bulls or bears on top
of each other. There was room to put two of the things next to each other on
a square, but that would make moving a "king" mildly inconvenient.

Can companies make money from attractive but pointless takes on games like
this?
