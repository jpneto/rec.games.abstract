Hello Glenn,

1rst: a historical approach (doesn't work well with modern games)
2nd: a logic approach based on ONE common feature of all games: I decided
to chose the goal (object) of the game. Every game has a goal, a way
to win or to lose.

This has been done before quite often.  Most authors have defined them as
race games, ...

I doubt that there are "race game". Abstract games (which i know best)
have usually one final goal, sometimes two final goals which are equally
important (Example: Ninuki Renju --&gt; capturing 5 x 2 = 10 stones OR
5-in-a-row).  Backgammon (including diceless backgammon, diceless
ckeckgammon) is "normally" considered a "race game". But what is a
race? In any finite abstract game players try to reach a goal as fast as
possible. Otherwise you would waste moves and this isn't good in any game!
You have mating races in Shogi, connection races in Twixt, killing races
(semeais) in Go, etc. BTW, "racing" is not the final goal in
these games nor it is in Backgammon. The goal in Backgammon is to bear your
pieces off the board (and speed just helps you to be the first player to
achieve this goal). It appears that Backgammon is logically
related to Phutball or Alapo. But Checkgammon or Nardy bez Kostey (checkless
Narde) should, nevertheless, form a special subcategory:

(incomplete diagram - don't have the time now to show the full system)

                            --&gt; your opponent's base row
                                --&gt; with your own piece (Alapo)
                                --&gt; with a neutral piece (Phutball)
                            --&gt; a common base row (Racing Kings)
                        --&gt; other place(s) of the board
                             --&gt; with some of your pieces (Octi)
                             --&gt; with all your pieces (Salta, Halma)
                    --&gt; off-board (chessgammon, nardy bez kostey)


Keep in mind: this only relates to the final goal.

I've been trying to follow your thread, but am having some difficulty in
discerning your precise system.  Would you please elucidate?  Thanks.
