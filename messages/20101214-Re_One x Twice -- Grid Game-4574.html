(This is a game that maybe is technically inappropriate for
rec.games.abstract, since luck plays a role {although the 
random-number generators are only the player's own minds}. 
But it uses more strategy than you might first think.)

For 2 players.
Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper.

A move consists of both players each secretly picking an integer 
between 1 and n. Both numbers are then revealed. An x is then 
drawn in the grid-square that has the column number of player 1's 
number, and has the row number of player 2's number. So, in other 
words, player 1 picks the horizontal position of the number, and 
player 2 picks the vertical position.

If the x lands in an empty square, then the game continues.

But, however, the first time an x lands in a square that already 
has an x, then the game is over. Player 1 wins if this final x 
was written on an oddly numbered move. Player 2 wins if this x 
was written on an evenly numbered move. So, in other words, if 
there are an odd number of x's at game's end -- and an even number 
of squares with x's -- then player 1 wins. If there are an even 
number of x's -- and an odd number of squares with x's -- then 
player 2 wins.

What kind of strategies will help you win at this game (if you 
cannot read the other player's mind)?

I'm not sure if I'll have time to work on it, but I like the 
idea of the game.

I think a mixed strategy will be needed, but it will probably 
require a computer program to solve for it, since every move 
creates subgames,and those subgames (and their subgames) need 
to be analyzed first.

Actually, the solution is easy, no need for a computer analysis.

James Dow Allen showed the way for the case of a 2 x 2 grid. 

For an n x n grid, Player 2 can force a win, using the following
strategy (a straightforward generalization of James' 2 x 2 solution):

   1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, ..., n, 1

In other words, on move k,

   if k is odd, Player 2 chooses row k

   if k is even, Player 2 chooses row 1

which guarantees a win for Player 2 no later than move 2n.
