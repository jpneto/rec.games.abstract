<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:marksteere@gmail.com">marksteere@gmail.com</a>'s message of Yesterday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Checkers, Chess, and Go are all magnificent achievements for their
<br>simplicity and fundamental uniqueness.&nbsp; Checkers especially has
<br>probably been more imitated than any other game.&nbsp; How many games
<br>include the Checkers jump?&nbsp; The jump is a wonderful mechanism.&nbsp; It's
<br>simple, unique, and easy to perform. But every time I see the jump
<br>appear in a new game I want to barf.&nbsp; Designers: Just leave the jump in
<br>Checkers and come up with your own mechanisms.&nbsp; It's challenging but
<br>not impossible.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I think rather differently where mechanisms are concerned.
<br>
<br>Some mechanisms in new games appear contrived to me.&nbsp; I can't think of 
an example here and now, but at least one of Sid Sackson's games struck 
me this way.
<br>
<br>In contrast I find some of the older mechanisms beautiful in their 
simplicity, and some games still find elegant ways to use them.&nbsp; I like 
movement to adjacent squares, or by sliding in a given direction; 
I like capture by jump, replacement or surrounding.
<br>
<br>I don't dislike strange new mechanisms altogether.&nbsp; Cannon is a new game 
that appeals to me, though it uses non-traditional mechanisms like the 
cannon firing, and the movement of a whole column that I've seen in 
another modern game (Epaminondas?), in addition to more traditional 
forms of movement and capture.
