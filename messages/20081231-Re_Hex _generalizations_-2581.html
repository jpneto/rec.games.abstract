Technically, this is NOT a 7x7 Hex game, for two reasons.

The most important reason is, all experienced Hex players and all the
Hex servers on the Net use the swap rule. After the very first stone
is placed on the board the second player has the option at that
moment only to swap sides. This makes the game much more balanced and
interesting. But here, after 6  moves by each side, swapping sides in
Y is forbidden.

A non-issue, surely? If you trust your opponent to build the borders
before starting the alternative game, then you should trust your
opponent to play the first move of the alternative game, and offer you
a swap, before the artificial borders are constructed.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The bad Y moves that led to the 7x7 Hex position were LEGAL. Swapping
sides in the middle of a Y game is ILLEGAL, regardless of what the
players might think. So now you are talking about some modified rule
set.

No I'm not. Read what I wrote again but this time please ensure that
you've engaged your brain.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh, perhaps you mean the first move of the Y game should be within the 
Hex board region. For that matter, you could ignore all those border line 
moves, and both players agree to play within the Hex region, and the 
loser of the Hex game will agree to resign. But what does this have to do 
with the claim that Hex is some sort of subset of Y? Isn't that what this 
discussion was about?
