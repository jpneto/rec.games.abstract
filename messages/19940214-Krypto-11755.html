When I was in grade school  We played this game called Krypto.  It was
adeck of cards number 1-25.  Each player got five cards and a card was
placed in the middle.  You had to use all 5 of your cards and
addition,subtraction, multiplication and/or division to get the number in
the middle.  I had a set of cards but something happened to them.  Anybody
heard of this game and know where I can get a deck of Krypto cards?
