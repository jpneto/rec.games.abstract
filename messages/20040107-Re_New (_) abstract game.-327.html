Joao Neto and myself have discovered a new abstract board game, which seems

  I feel that it's not quite as natural as, say, Checkers or Hex,
because it requires adding multiple pieces at a time to the board as
the game goes on.  I can't say <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>why<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that feels weird, since obviously
it can be played with either stones or paper-and-pencil just as easily
as Hex.  But it feels... weird.  :-S
  It's a very interesting game, though.  Looks just simple enough, and
just complex enough, to be fun.

We initially played it on a hexagonal board, but it seems just as adaptable

  Square grid has the disadvantage(?) that you can pass right through
a diagonal line, by traveling on the perpendicular diagonal.  It's a
change, anyway.  Assuming you allow diagonal motion, I guess.

Because first-stymied is the loser, this is clearly a "standard" type of
Nimmish game, a la "Winning Ways", though I don't recall ever seeing it
noted there.  Theoretically, the first mover (probably, for most sizes)
has a sure win, but it would take Deep Yellow to work out what it was.

  How did you work that out?  Surely any algorithm that would show
that the first player had a win in a Nim-like game, would also show
what that win was.  (I don't think the symmetry argument from Hex
applies here, but I could be missing something.)
  In fact, the second player wins on the trivial 1x1x1 and 2x2x2 hex
boards (with 1 and 7 pips, respectively).  So I think it's not as
trivial a game as all that.

When the remaining reachable areas become small or thin, ordinary CGT

  CGT analysis?  Could you give a pointer to more information on
whatever that is, please?  (Scary... I took combinatorics last
semester and I've already forgotten how to analyze big Nim-like
games...)

So anyway, has anyone ever heard of such a game?  And whether or not you
have, give it a whirl - it's a lot of fun!  And maybe an eventual member
of Richard's play-by-email server?

  What's that?  Sounds like something in which I might be interested.
