No.  If you are in a three-player game and both opponents are using this
mixed strategy, they will choose the same number with probability 1/2,
and so if you choose 3 you will win with probability 1/2.  

For the three-player case, I believe an equilibrium strategy must 
choose j with probability p_j satisfying the equations
p_j^2 + (1-p_1-...-p_{j+1})^2 = (1-p_1-...-p_j)^2 , j = 1,2,3...
together with, of course, sum_j p_j = 1 and all p_j &gt; 0.

This is because if two players are using this mixed strategy, the
third will have no reason to switch iff his probability of winning
is the same for all pure strategies, and his probability of winning
by choosing j is sum_{i=1}^{j-1} p_i^2 + (1-p_1-...-p_j)^2
(i.e. he wins if both opponents choose the same number &lt; j or 
both choose any numbers &gt; j).  This system of equations looks
rather formidable to solve; for n &gt; 3 players, it will be even
more complicated.

In any case, there can't be an equilibrium strategy that involves 
sometimes using m and never using m+1, because then each player would 
have an incentive to use m+1 instead of m (if the opponents never use 
m+1, then m+1 would win in every case where m would win, and would also 
win in some cases where m would not).
