  (AA meeting format:) Hi. My name's Dave, and I eat Kix for breakfast.
  Hokay - got that off my chest. Anyway, on the back of the cereal box 
  they have a game; I figured I'd post it here. 

  The board is a hexagon with a center, and one of the edges removed,
  like this:

	   0-----0
          / \   / \
         /   \ /   \
        0-----0-----0
         \   / \   /
	  \ /   \ /
	   0     0

  There are 2 players, each player has 3 pieces on the board. The pieces
  inhabit one of the "0"s above; the lines between the "0"s indicate
  valid moves from that location. The goal of the game is to leave your
  opponant without a move. The pieces are initially placed around the 
  perimeter of the board, alternating. i.e. the center is vacant, and
  the order of the pieces is (white,black,white,black,white,black) around
  the edge.

  I haven't analyzed the game, but it ought to be a piece of cake.
