But one issue that I'm guessing will be central is: how much of a
stone-advantage on board does one player need before his win becomes
inevitable? If he doesn't need much of an advantage, then the game
could be decided in the first capture or two, which would mean that
the rest of the game, all the cycling, would be pointless. That would
be a drag. Any thoughts as to whether that would be the case? I pose
this question to everybody, since I'm guessing the question probably
qualifies as too Plebian for you (Mark) to bother with.

I think that might indeed be the case. Looking at the game between
Mark and Luis (hexhex base-5, 61 cells) Mark gave up in a position
with 5 cancer stones and a fairly full board (26 white, 14 red).
Looking at the final position, one tends to wonder why those 5 black
stones are there anyway. This obviously is a very benign cancer, not
likely to spread. ;-)
