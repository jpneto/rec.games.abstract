Hi All,

I thought I would lurk here for a few days and gain a little insight on
the theory and practice of abstract games. But all I find appears to be
insults and flames.

"Surely", I think "there must be some underlying structure, message, or
underlying pattern in these postings?"

But try as I do, I cannot fathom the objective, play, or scoring
mechanism for this 'Abstract Insult' game.

Does any competitor (or fellow lurker) here have a suitable reference
for a forum where abstract games are discussed?

Cheers,
Mike

Hi Mike,

First of all, there's an alternative:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/recregamescombinatorial?hl=en">http://groups.google.com/group/recregamescombinatorial?hl=en</a>

It's a closed group with the ambition to "to discuss abstract games in
a productive and encouraging environment".

Mark's not allowed in there - it can't be the insults, because Bill
Taylor <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> allowed in there.
I've left on a voluntary basis: the members include a number of
interesting and intelligent people, but I'm in contact with most of
them as it is, and I don't need a cosy refuge from Mark. What I hear
is that the group is as good as dead, but you can easily check it out.

I try to post something halfway interesting at times, but threads all
seem to diverge from any subject not being Bill Taylor, who is the
world famous patron saint of games mediocrity.

Bill Taylor doesn't like Mark.
Bill Taylor doesn't like me.
Bill Taylor likes profanity.

On a personal note: I wouldn't express my opinions quite the way Mark
does, but I'm not bothered by it. Mark has an undeniable talent and
for me that goes a long way. Sometimes I wish he'd take a more
interesting subject than Bill Taylor, but I'm no moderator and this is
not a moderated forum. On the same note: I wish Bill would keep to
"discussing abstract games in a productive and encouraging
environment" - but he keeps showing up here.
