I see a variant off this where players before starting, can decide
whether to have a queen, elephant or hawk in the queen space to start.

Any comments?

A funny thing happened on the way to wanting to promote Seirawan
Chess.  IAGO World Tour, in response to the question, was told by one
of the designers to "buzz off", and that he didn't like Chess
Variants, didn't care what the chess variant community named them, and
didn't want to have anything to do with chess variants.  This is the
nutshell of the correspondence.  So IAGO World Tour won't be able to
do Seirawan Chess.

Well, in response to this an alternative to Seirawan Chess was
developed, that does similar, but is far more robust in its style, and
designed to evolve over time.  It also incorporates the world of chess
variants into it.  It goes by IAGO Chess, and is on the chess variants
website at IAGO Chess System (this was due partly due to an oops in
trying to get the rules up on the website).  The URL is here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSiagochesssyste">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSiagochesssyste</a>

The pieces follow the standard Capablanca piece, and is designed to
add new pieces later (such as the Empress), and accomodate just about
all variants of FIDE chess that you find on the chess variants site.

Please feel free to check it out and comment.  It isn't meant to be
some revolutionary, "I am more brilliant than everyone else, pay
attention", but a practical solution to enable chess to continue to
evolve and integrate variants into its framework, without them being
viewed as some unwelcome freaks.

By the way, FIDE Chess is also in there, for those who don't want to
do variants.
