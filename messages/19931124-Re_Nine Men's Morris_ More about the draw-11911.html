This appears to be a mistake.  Er, let me rephrase that.  "The evidence
supplied does not prove your conclusion."

In building the 9-9 and 9-8 databases, you would have used the smaller
data bases.  Retrograde analysis starts from the smallest, and works
up.

Say some position in the 8-7 database is a draw.  Then in the 8-8
database, a position where the player may close a mill and reduce to
the drawn 8-7 position gets marked as a draw (assuming there's no
winning move).

You don't need the 8-7 database in doing the opening search, because
you don't need to know why the particular 8-8 position is drawn.  This
is NOT the same thing as

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The fact that you didn't need the smaller databases in the opening
search just means that no player need close more than one mill *DURING
THE OPENING* to reach a draw.  It doesn't mean the player doesn't need
to close a mill during the middle or end game.

The correct statement, based on the evidence you give, is "neither
player need close more than one mill, and only during the opening, to
reach a book draw."  Well, now that the initial position of NMM is
solved, we could even say "neither player needs to make a move to reach
a book draw."  Of course, if your opponent doesn't agree, you still
have to play out the book draw, and that (may) require the smaller
databases.  Or may not require the smaller databases.  I have nothing
to contradict your statement.  I'm just asking for more support.
