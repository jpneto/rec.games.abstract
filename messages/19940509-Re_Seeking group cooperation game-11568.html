A friend of mine who does management training seminars asked me
if I could devise for him a game that would illustrate the synergy
of group cooperation.  The Prisoners' Dilemma does this to some
extent but he would like a game which also has an individual

The only constraints on the type of game are that it be suitable for
play in a management seminar (i.e., we are not talking rocket scientists).

There is a company in Plymouth, Michigan which produces some 
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>excellent<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> materials for exactly this purpose.  I have no
idea what they charge, though, or even whether they provide
just the materials or the materials and training.  

The company is:

	Human Synergistics
	39819 Plymouth Rd.
	Plymouth Township, MI  48170
	(313) 459-1030

Several years ago, the company I was working for held an in-house 
seminar centered around an arctic survival scenario.  I was so 
impressed that I took down the name of the company who published the 
materials for it.  It sounds like just the sort of thing you're 
looking for.
