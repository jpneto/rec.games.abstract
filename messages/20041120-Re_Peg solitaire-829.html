Hi,

i'm writing my own version of the peg solitaire game.
The problem is that my program run too slow. On configurations with 32
pegs, the
programs can run even for 30 mins.

I use simple brute force, with a cache that store invalid
configurations (those that cannot
be reduced to only one peg).
I order the edges of the search space with a function that try to
minimize the covered area
and the "dispersion" of the board.
This function work better if i use the look-ahead technique.
But if the move at deep 10 is wrong, than the program simply have to
consider too much configurations.

I don't have access to two of the most important books on the subject,
so i really don't know how to go on.

I know, for example, that there are some necessary conditions called
"pagoda functions". Can someone explain me how to use and generate
this functions? Can i use a pagoda function with an arbitrary
configuration
of pegs?

I've found genetic algorithms to be quite effective in solving problems of
this kind. As a simple example, I wrote a GA program to solve the 8-queens
problem in chess which it does successfully in only a few seconds on average
(and would take less time if it wasn't displaying the results as it goes). I
used a similar program to solve a much more difficult problem of finding a
precursor to a Game of Life position on a large grid (well, it never quite
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>solved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it, but after several months' runtime it got pretty close...)

I won't go into details of GAs and how they work (there's plenty of
information on the subject freely available). The only problem I can see is
in a sequential game like peg solitaire I'm not sure how you'd encode the
'genome' - there's probably a standard method but I don't know it. The most
obvious idea that presents itself is to have a gene for each possible board
position, but of course that's unworkable in practice. The other is to have
one gene for each move and the alleles would be the numbers of the pegs, but
then firstly the vast majority of strands would be impossible in principle
(because a particular peg can't be moved at that moment or has already been
removed) and secondly this would put disproportionate weight on the initial
moves, 'locking in' the early moves and making them hard to change.

I'm quite tempted to give this a go now. But I can't. Still, a project for
later. Anyway, hope that jargon-ridden answer helps.

Danny
