I picked up a game the other day called YALi, from a company called Jumbo
International.  Looks like it was released around 1996.

It caught my eye because on the surface there appeared to be some
similarities to Abalone, a long-time favorite of mine.  Essentially, the
board and the marbles (or in this case steel balls) are an integral part of
the game.  In Abalone, it's the pushing of the marbles that defines the
game.  In the case of YALi, it's the tipping of the board from side to side
that defines the player who can move next.  Certainly appears to be an
interesting concept.

We haven't had a chance to play it yet, but I just thought I would throw
the name out there and see if anyone has any thoughts/comments on this
interesting looking game.

Best regards,
Allan
