I already said in some other thread that, though I like Redstone quite
much, I don't think it's the ideal Go variant. These are my (arguable)
reasons:

a) It's an annihilation game, a theme which doesn't fit as well with
the mechanics as a territory theme. Redstone's endgames, unlike Go's,
are unnecessarily long and a bit too "combinatorial" for my taste. Of
course, not having to count is a plus (and I've already said that
too), but I'm not sure whether it's worth it. After all, counting
takes actually much shorter than playing out a Redstone endgame, which
must be monstruous on a full 19x19 board. 200 generations of Go
players haven't played No-Pass Go instead for a reason.

b) The red stones are ugly, especially considering that they are only
rarely used in the game.

c) Loose, like Redstone, is finite, (soft-)decisive and inspired by
Go, but it doesn't suffer from the mentioned problems.

The positive thing of Redstone is that it's more or less Go without
cycles. That's why I like it despite its ugliness, but that's not the
same thing as saying that it's the ideal variant.
