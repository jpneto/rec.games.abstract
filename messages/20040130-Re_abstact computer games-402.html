I enjoy abstract board (or table, or whatever the term I should use is?)
games, and often play them with friends either in real life, or over e-mail.

However I there are also good abstract games which perhaps would not work
without a computer (tetris is of course by far the most obvious example).

Tetris is not "perfect information" which means the player or players have
access to all information about the game. In Tetris, tetrominoes appear at
random at the top of the screen. You can see a preview of the next one,
but nothing beyond that, so Tetris does not qualify as an abstract game
by this definition.

But even if you did see all the upcoming tile shapes and where and when
they will appear, Tetris is still a puzzle not a game. Abstract games are
between two or more players.
