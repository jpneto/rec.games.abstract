|&gt; Marseillais Chess
|&gt; Balanced Marseillais Chess 
|&gt;... [etc]...

Many thanks to Robin King for posting this list. There were another few 
variations we used to play back in college days, which were quite fast-moving
and lots of fun. They can be played either as 
kill-all-the-opponents-pieces-to-win, (fast &amp; furious &amp; clod-hoppery),  or as
kill-the-opponents-king-to-win,  (frustratingly delicate, at times).


Hand-grenade chess:  
   After a move, every enemy piece adjacent to the moved piece is removed.

Kami-kazi chess:
   Ditto, but if this happens the moved piece is also removed ! 

Death-ray chess:
   After a move, every enemy piece attacked (standard-chess-wise) by the 
    moved piece is removed. 
   (NOT cumulatively, i.e. when an enemy is shielding another enemy.)
 
Anti-deathray chess:
   After a piece is moved, every enemy piece which <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is attacking<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the moved
    piece is removed.

This last one gives rise to a fascinating game when played take-king-to-win
style. I only wish I could have played it for longer, it was so interesting.
The reason is, powerful-moving pieces (Q,R,B) are more vulnerable, so not
so powerful in fact, especially in the opening and middle game. In fact, they
may be rather useless !  B and Q are especially vulnerable to opening pawn
moves.  It's worth a look at this one, if you have a like-minded friend on hand.
