Eureka!  I have found it!

I happened to stop in my local game store, The Game Keeper, and inquired
about Cosmic Wimpout.  Not only did they know about it, they had a few
copies <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>in stock<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>!

However, the only edition they had was the basic edition, not the
deluxe version.  The person assisting me looked through their catalogs
and came up empty about the deluxe version, but he is going to check
with the home office tomorrow (Monday, May 30) to see if they can get
it for me.  He will be in touch...

In the meantime, if you wish to order the basic edition, the details are:

The Game Keeper
7997-L Tysons Corner Center
McLean, VA  22103

Phone:  (703) 821-5468
Fax:    Same as above.  Call voice first.

Cosmic Wimpout.  Basic Edition  $5.75

They accept various credit cards, etc.
