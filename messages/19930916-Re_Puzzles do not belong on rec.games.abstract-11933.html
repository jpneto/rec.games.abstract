|&gt; This puzzle was posted less than three days ago.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Puzzles do not belong on rec.games.abstract; they belong on rec.puzzles.
|&gt; Please try to post articles to appropriate groups.
|&gt; 
|&gt; Thanks you.

I agree with Kevin that puzzles do not belong here. However, before you
start taking number puzzles like these to rec puzzles, let me - a regular
rec.puzzles reader - quote from the FAQ:

  0.  INTRODUCTION AND CONTENTS

  The rec.puzzles newsgroup is generally a friendly one, and the
  signal-to-noise ratio is relatively high compared with that of other
  Usenet newsgroups.  However, many rec.puzzles readers have a MAJOR PET
  PEEVE -- seeing the same old puzzles (and the same old answers, and
  the same old discussions) over and over and over and ...

  [...]

  3.  FREQUENTLY ASKED PUZZLES (GENERAL):

  This section gives information on some general categories of puzzles
  that pop up over and over again.  

  [...]

  3.3.  Sequence puzzles
  
     O, T, T, F, F, S, ?               ==&gt; series.06 &lt;==
     5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 5, 7, 5, ?         ==&gt; series.21 &lt;==
     ...

  The problem with letter sequences is that we've seen most of them,
  quite possibly even that one you just thought of all by yourself.
  Check out the archive, in the general category "series", to make sure
  yours isn't there.
  
  The problem with number sequences is that many puzzlers find them
  unsatisfying, since there are infinitely many formulas that will fit
  any finite sequence, and the concept of "simplest" or "best" formula
  is a slippery one.  Since number sequences inevitably lead to the same
  old discussion, it's probably best to avoid them in rec.puzzles.  Fans
  of number sequences may enjoy <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>A Handbook of Integer Sequences<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, by
  N.J.A. Sloane, Academic Press, New York, 1973, and _Supplement I to A
  Handbook of Integer Sequences_, Sloane, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, New
  Jersey, 1974


So that's it, you would definitely want to follow rec.puzzles long
enough to get to read the entire FAQ, (or look it up in news.answers).
Then you would also learn how to access the rec.puzzles archive and
consult the rec.puzzles oracle.
