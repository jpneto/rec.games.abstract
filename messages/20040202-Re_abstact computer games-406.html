Hello!

I enjoy abstract board (or table, or whatever the term I should use is?)
games, and often play them with friends either in real life, or over e-mail.

However I there are also good abstract games which perhaps would not work
without a computer (tetris is of course by far the most obvious example).

I was wondering if there are any sites or groups which discuss abstract
computer games? (or should I talk about them right here? ^_^ )

You make a good point - there doesn't seem to be a great interest in 
computer applications here (except maybe Zillions Of Games).  Not saying 
there should be, just making an observation!  I don't know of any better 
newsgroup, though.

My game Zen ( <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bindweed.com/zen/zen.htm">http://bindweed.com/zen/zen.htm</a> ) is a 2-player abstract 
game which would be difficult though possible to play without a 
computer.  But games based on Conway's Life are not uncommon, and seem 
to be more popular among programmers than players...  If folks are 
interested, Zen is probably one of the better ones, and the computer 
opponents are decent.  (Windows only.)
