So tempo is key.  I'd like to make the observation that the usual
proof of a win for Black (first mover) breaks down if White is given
a double-move at the end.  This is also true for Hex.  (For example,
consider a trivial 1x3 "majority wins" game -- White wins.)  However,
in practice few games of Hex (between humans?) fill up the board.
Or can it be true that under perfect play White can keep Black from
winning up to the point where only two cells remain (on an odd board
of sufficient size) -- thereby winning with a double-move?  It seems
highly unlikely but I'll propose this as a problem for the Hex
mathematician :-)

What is the smallest number Wn such that White wins nxn Hex if he is
allowed to make moves number n^2-Wn+1, ... , n^2?

I would take the rule "White gets to play the last two moves," to mean
the last
two moves of the game, not the last two moves needed to fill up the
board.
That is, if the board is half-filled, but White can win by playing two
moves in a row, then he can put down two stones. This seems to me to
be too much of an
advantage, although it might be worth experimenting with. 

I agree that only letting White put down the last two stones to fill
up the
board would not be particularly useful.
