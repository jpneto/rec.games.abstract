For anybody interested in three dimensional chess:

I have written a version computer program based on the rules
of the original Raumschach (space chess).

The sourcecode is written in C++ and is at the ftp-site ftp.csh.rit.edu
under the directory csh/joer/3dchess (anonymous login). All files in that
directory should be copied in oprder to compile. Compile-instructions are in the README-file.
The directory also includes a "rules"-file, which was posted before on
some newsgroup by Bruce Balden (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:balden@van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca">balden@van-bc.wimsey.bc.ca</a>). In a subdirectory
called moves is a visuilation of the moves of every piece.

The program is developped mainly for a two-player game over the network on
two different terminals. Setting it up for your own computer shouldn't
be too difficult as, most of the files are well-documented.
The interface is text-based. In the rules is move-checking included. The com-
puter also detects check, but is unable to see check-mate.
Still, the version is well playable.
A computer opponent is included, but it does not play very sophisticated and
interesting and should only be used to get an example on how the game is
played.

Please mail me any comments, feedbak and suggestions.
Have fun playing it.
