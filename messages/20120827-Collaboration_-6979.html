I'm old and running low on inventing energy.  Soon I'll be like
Christian, dwelling in the past and muttering about my unappreciative
audience.  I'd never have considered a collaboration before, but maybe
now's the time.

Anyhoodles, here's an outline.  Goban, Player Black and Player White,
each with their own stones, exclusively.  One stone placed per turn
except after kills.  Odd sized board starts out empty, ends completely
filled.  Winner has most stones on board.  No moving stones.  Only
placing and removing.

NON-CYCLING MECHANISM: There should be opportunities to kill
singletons, or maybe multiple singletons per turn, or maybe groups,
around the middle of the game.  You begin your turn by placing a
single stone of your color, and if you don't kill anything, that's
it.  If you kill an enemy stone, you place another friendly stone
during your turn, and so on, until you make a non-capturing
placement.  (I don't like placing multiple friendly stones without
killing or any enemy stones).  ***So there ends up being one more
stone on the board at the conclusion of your turn.***  If you kill two
singletons, add two more stones.  This could be used for group killing
too.  Just require that you add as many friendly stones on your turn
(after your initial placement) as enemy stones you removed.  That's
plus one stone.

All that remains is a killing mechanism.  I think it would be cleaner,
given the outline, if singletons or multiple singletons were killed,
instead of groups, but can't rule out groups.

I wouldn't want it to be a variant of anything. Especially not Oust.

'Nother idea.  Hex starting out without colored sides.  The side
colors are determined during the game, based on shit that happens
during the game.  Might require a special tessellation, with colored
tiny cells interspersed among the larger cells, for example (just
thinking out loud, might not make sense).
