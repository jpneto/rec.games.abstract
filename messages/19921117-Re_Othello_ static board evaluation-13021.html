I plan to implement a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta cutoffs. This
works good enough, as this is a minor project for school, and not an
olympic winner-to-be. However, I find it hard to implement a good
static board evaluation. The one I'm currently using gives every
position on the board a specific value if the computer occupies
it, minus that same value if the player has it, and 0 if it's
currently empty.

This is the method used by most "beginners" trying to make an
evaluation function, and as you said it isn't very good. In my program
I use these factors:

  1) How many legal moves does the opponent have. A small number is
     good.

  2) I have built a table of all possible combinations of pieces on an
     edge (there are only about 6500) and assigned each of these a
     value. This is (of course) not done by hand, but by a program
     that makes an exhaustive search of all plays on the edge. A legal
     move is is of course one that flips pieces on the edge, but in
     addition to these I have considered three different lines of
     play: in the first, the opponent is able to move in any empty
     square except corners, but you only by flipping. In the second,
     it is opposite and in the third both are able to move anywhere
     except corners. At the point where no further moves are
     possible, the number of safe (unflippable) pieces are counted,
     with the corner counting extra. The values of the different lines
     of play are added using weights that reflect playing strategy. A
     high weight on the case where the opponent has the advantage
     gives a defensive play, where a high weight on your own advantage
     gives a more aggresive play. Once the table is made, it is fairly
     quick to look up any edge position in the table.

  3) I look at the control of the diagonals. If the diagonal space
     next to a corner is occupied and the corner itself isn't, the
     values of the neighbouring edges after a move by the opposite
     colour in the corner are used to modify the value of the
     position. If a move to the corner is immediately possible, the
     effect of it counts more than if not, especially near the end of
     the game.

Note that I nowhere use a weighted sum of the occupied squares.
However, near the end of the game all remaining moves are explored
fully, and a simple sum is used as value. The program plays reasonably
well, though nowhere near as good as the program Colin Springer is
coauthor of.

Other things you can consider is to make extra deep search of forced
moves and passes, counting safe pieces not on the corners, counting
the number of "good" moves rather than the total number of moves when
counting mobility. A good move could be defined as one that does not
move next to an empty corner.
