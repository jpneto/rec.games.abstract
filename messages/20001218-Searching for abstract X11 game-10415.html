A few years back I had a X11-based computer-moderated multiplayer game
which I am trying to find again to play with my kids. The game was
played simultaneously in real-time on a tessellated (sp?) plane (in
varying geometries) with each player attempting to 'fill' all tiles on
the board. Certain tiles we assigned to be sources for each player and
subsequent tiles were 'filled' by connecting them to source tiles. A
tile was controlled by whichever player had the greatest amount of
supply connected to the contested tile.

This was a great game, although fairly unconventional. Has anybody got
source, or even remember the name of it (so I can do my own search)?
