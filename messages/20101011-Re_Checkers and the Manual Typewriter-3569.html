What is robustness and why does robustness matter?  An oversimplified

I agree with most of this Mark. I agree that a "robust" game has a low
or 0 percent draw rate and a low turn order advantage. I disagree
however that you cannot gauge how high a draw rate will be in a given
game before playing it hundreds of times. Often, there are ways to
estimate how large a draw rate or turn order advantage will be based
on the mechanics alone.

Ok, but you can't know that your game will not succumb to high draw
rates with advancing skill if you've done hardly shit to advance the
skill.  New tactics could develop that could blow the game out of the
water.  You'd have to "divine" the future gameplay like Christian
Freeling, a skill few of us have (not even Christian Freeling, I
suspect).

It wasn't my intention to roast Patrick Carroll here, though I
certainly support your right to do so.  It was just that in a sea of
vacuous Checkers posts at bgg, Patrick's floated a little higher.

That does sound a tad constipated.
