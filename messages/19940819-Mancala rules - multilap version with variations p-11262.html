Here is a mancala game with some variations and a couple 
challenges. 



The board is 2x6 with a store on each end.

                          North
                     f  e  d  c  b  a
North's holes ----&gt;  4  4  4  4  4  4
North's store --&gt; 0                    0 &lt;-- South's store
                     4  4  4  4  4  4  &lt;---- South's holes
                     A  B  C  D  E  F
                          South

The player begins by lifting all the seeds from one of the 
holes (A, B, C, D, E or F for South, and a, b, c, d, e, or f 
for North) and then drops them one at a time counter-
clockwise in all the other holes, including the player's own 
store but excluding the opponent's store. This lifting and 
sowing of all the seeds in a hole is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lap<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

There are five possible outcomes to each lap. They are:

1) If the last seed of a lap falls in the player's store, 
   the player gets another turn to start a lap from any of his 
   or her own holes. There is no limit to the number of extra 
   turns.

2) If the last seed of a lap falls in any hole other that 
   the store with at least one seed in it, the player lifts 
   them all and continues sowing. There is no limit to the 
   number of laps per turn.

3) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the 
   <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opponent's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> side of the board, the turn is over.

4) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the 
   <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>player's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> side of the board, and the hole directly across 
   from it on the opponent's side is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>empty<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, the turn is over.

5) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the 
   *player'* side of the board, and the hole directly across 
   from it on the opponent's side has at least one seed in it, 
   all seeds in both holes are captured and placed in the 
   player's store, ending the turn.

Also, if you start a lap from a hole with more 12 seeds, you 
do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> skip over the starting hole on your way around. In 
other words, the 13th seed ends up back in the hole it 
started in. (This is the opposite of the rule in Wari.)

The game ends when all the seeds are captured. A player who 
has no seeds passes. You are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> compelled to give your 
opponent a seed to move. The player with the most seeds is 
the winner.


The trouble with this version is that the first player has 
enough options to make it possible to win before the second 
player even takes a turn! Of course, when we were kids, we 
played a lot before I figured this out. 

Here is the challenge:

   Find the maximum number of seeds the first player can 
   capture without the second player getting a turn. Give 
   the sequence of moves and the total captured. (So far, 
   30 is the best I've done.)

   What is the maximum number of seeds the first player 
   can capture regardless of the moves the second player 
   makes. Is it possible to force a 48 to nothing win?

Email me your results and I'll post a summary and the best 
answer.



To make the game playable make one of these modifications:

A) Change the number of seeds in the holes. If you play with 
   six seed per hole, the game is nearly identical to 'Dakon' 
   as described by Laurence Russ in 'Mancala Games'. Of course, 
   with a little study, the first player can win more that half 
   the seeds outright in this case also.
  
B) One player takes all the seeds from one hole and places 
   each of them in any holes on either side of the board. The 
   other player then which side to take. Finally the first 
   player decides who goes first. Another variation is for one 
   player to distribute the seeds anyway at all. Still, with 
   careful study, the game is decided in one or two turns.

C) Ignore rule #2 and play the game with single laps only. 
   This changes the game completely. This is identical to 
   'Kalah' described in 'Board Games Round the World' by Bell and 
   Cornelius. That game uses either 3, 4, 5 or 6 seeds per 
   hole. This seems like a very common version, at least in the 
   US.

D) Change rule #1 so that when your last seed lands in your 
   store, your turn ends. This also changes the game 
   completely. This is similar to Congklak also described in 
   BGRW. That game uses a 2x5 board with five seeds per hole.

E) Do not sow into your store. This also eliminates rule #1 
   and limits you to a one multilap turn.

F) Do not allow players to touch or count seeds in holes before
   picking which hole to play from. You may 'eyeball' the hole, 
   but that's it. This is a common rule. It may not prevent you 
   from running the board right from the start if you've memorized
   a winning sequence, but combined with variation 'A' you've got
   a good, playable game without changing the nature of the game. Of
   course, you can't help but count the seeds when you're playing
   through the email!
