Bill is actually a fairly representative Christian, mainly with the
bullying.  Or I should say attempted bullying since nobody here is
intimidated by Laughable Bill, with the possible exception of Harald
Korneliussen.

Grotesque hypocrisy, another hallmark of Christianity, is Bill's defining
characteristic.  Screaming about egos while sporting a huge ego himself. 
And screaming about how I ruined the group while taking two months out of
his life to try and ruin the group.

Bill's ego is not troublesome in itself.  It's the fact that it's totally
baseless.
