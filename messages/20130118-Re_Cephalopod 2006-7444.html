I really do not care about what you think.
I just wanted to show your contradictions.
You see similarities where you want but when it comes to your games you become blind.
Exasott is a game based on 2 rules.
Forcibly it will look like any other game.
Try it and you will see how deep is the game.
You have no idea about the game itself.
The huge difference between hold that line and exasott is that you can start your "line" anywhere on the board.
The huge difference is that you have to manage your sticks such as in the end you will always place your remaining sticks.
Some tokens will remain isolated.
The game seems simple but for someone who never played it he will not know what is good move and bad move.
I have a variant with more sticks and one "blocking" ring. A blocking ring is a ring that you can move under conditions. Its goal is to prohibit your opponent from removing one of the tokens on the board.
The game will be more sophisticated and lenghty.
Exasott was inspired by the need to use sticks.
I have 5 games using sticks.
Puzzle-games are unexploited as kind of abstract games.
Let me tell you one thing :
You loose nothing by pointing out to similarities to any game.
The goal is to build a strong and funny game.
My hope is that some political system will abolish once for all the intellectual property.
No one would claim intellectual property because it stop any creativity.
How can someone claim intellectual property when he was feeded intellectually by the society where he is living??????????????
The science belongs to all the cultures!!!!
Picasso as an example made lot of money from African culture.
Some artists are stealing First Nations Australian art.
Others here in Canada are stealing Inuit art.
And so on.
People are making money by stealing plants.
No European country knew potatoe before they stole it from Indian american (South America I mean).
