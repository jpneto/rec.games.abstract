Another possibility is to use speed chess as "Overtime", like the
did recently with Chess960 as a way to tie-break.  Don't like to go
there, well then win?

I'd much rather see joint champions declared than have ever-more
ludicrous tie-breaks used to separate them.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ok, do joint champion then, and the first one to get defeating in a
chess tournament ends up losing their title, making the other champion
the regular champion.  The player who beat one of the champs gets a
title shot against the champion.  You need a regular chess schedule to
make this work.

Doubling certainly wouldn't work in a tournament -- somebody might
well win the tournament just because his opponent stubbornly kept
redoubling in a lost position.  I don't think it's a good idea in
matches, either.  Doubling works in backgammon because small mistakes
and bad luck can cause the lead in a game to be exchanged back and
forth between the players.  There's no luck in chess and mistakes tend
to be more serious so it's not so common for the players to trade the
lead.  Usually, one player or the other builds up a steadily growing
advantage and the question is whether his opponent will be able to
hang on for a draw, not whether the leader will make a mistake and let
his opponent win.

Point here is to drive a game to closure, and have each game advance
the reaching of a closure point.

The last option is to add new rules to chess, to make the game new.
Of course, this is heresy to hardcore players of the game, who think
the FIDE rules were handed down by God and immutable for eternity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've already pointed out that there have been non-trivial changes to
the rules in the last few years.  This idea that chess players believe
the laws to be immutable is a straw man.

The changes will have worked, when the rest of the world starts to
actually care about chess, rather than know what it is, and thinks of
it akin to Calculus.
