     Okay, I've got a puzzle I need help with. Actually, it's my brother's
puzzle and it's driving him crazy. So, if anyone knows the solution to this
problem let me know. The object is to draw a line through every line but only
once. I know it sounds easy, but it isn't.

I know the drawing looks odd but it's supposed to be two boxes on top of three
boxes. It's an old puzzle, but I need to find out if there is a solution. Just
e-mail me if you know how to solve it.
