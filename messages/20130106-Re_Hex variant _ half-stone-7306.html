Well, I won't argue with you, Luis.  Atoll is definitely my least original game because of 8-Sided Hex.  Sometimes I withdraw games once I realize that they're unoriginal as I did with Mosaic and a game that was similar to a Bill Taylor game.  Atoll I let stand though because it was, in my view, a vast improvement.  It's a generalization that works with 8 sides, or 10 sides, etc.  The non-obvious thing about Atoll that made it work was treating each segment as a line of stones of the player's color.  That feature is what sets it apart and what makes Mobius possible.

You didn't answer my question about what designer has invented more original abstract games than I have.  I'm not saying they're all great, but almost all of them are extremely original.  I'll take your silence as confirmation of the fact.  Nobody else even comes close.
