It appears there are two versions of this game - the orginal poster
had obviously seen the one in Games magazine, in which the pieces
are initially arranged in the order N Q K B R. However the version
I know of starts with the pieces arranged R N B Q K. In this version
you are allowed to castle, and there is no "20-move" rule.

Given that the board is so much more restricted than the full chess
board, I wonder if one of the top-level chess playing machines
couldn't actually solve these games completely?
