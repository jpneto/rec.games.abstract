What will be interesting is if you start doing games where players can

Do you mean inside the game? If so, that's just another rule for the
game. You can define the movement of the chess pieces in terms of rule
changes, if you really want to. I don't understand why you care about
this.

I was thinking something along the lines of "Magic: The Gathering" but
chess related.  The idea of in-game mutators, working a bit like
Nightmare Chess works, but working in a deterministic manner.

Or do you mean outside the game? Then it's politics, and using
politics to redefine the game as to "hinder your opponent" is just an
ugly metagame I'm not interested in playing - or writing an AI for.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

All games are played in the metagame, particularly on the higher
level.  Players do things within the rules to get the edge.  This is
part of the game.  Even gaming the scoring system to win.  Because a
scoring system is a game, it gets gamed.  Might as well acknowledge
this, and allow players the freedom to experiment in the metagame.
One thing this would do, is force AI research to consider new things,
beyond trees and min-max.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But for AI for a game with "rules that change" (or more properly,
there is one position in the game which has an infinite number of
possible moves), that can be done. MC programs in principle need only
a description of the game in order to play it, these descriptions can
be arbitrarily large.

But you want it set up so players are gaming each other, not just
maximizing the environment for their advantage alone.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I recently learned that Cameron Browne (game designer and author of
"Hex Strategy" and "Connection Games") has already done this,
developed a language to describe games and and MC/UCT player that can
play them well. He used it to evolve the game of Yavalath.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nomic ties into this, as does the random Fluxx, and there are others.
Not saying that this is meant to be mainstream, but I say it could tie
into the greater whole of the chess experience.  You play around this
area and allow the best forms to bubble up, and people play to see
what combination of rules in game break it.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There are games which are hard for MC prgrams. There are games which
are easy for MC programs, but which are even easier for humans, like
Go. But this proves nothing. I'm sure it would be easy to evolve an
anti-human game with Browne's system. Indeed, I suspect the computer
will play better on most large randomly designed rulesets.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Will need to see how a Mega Zillions program would do, or how an AI
does a game like Magic: The Gathering.  Now take Magic, and mix it
with chess.
