The pie rule ruins Monkey Queen according to one guy, who happens to be a
good Shogi and Chess variants (and Monkey Queen) player.  The theory is that
the pie rule prevents White (Player 1) from "exploring the depth of the
game".

If exploring the depth of a game requires exploiting a significant initial
advantage, I don't want to explore that game.  First move advantage sucks. 
It ruins games.

The theory continues,

"Xyz Chess variant has great gameplay but there's an overwhelming first move
advantage and draw rate."

I'm just not buying that.  Robustness and quality of play are two different
things, but they're closely related, I believe.  I don't want a game that
people only want to play if they can move first.

I also don't want a game you have to play ten times straight, hoping that
someone will "break serve", to borrow a term from tennis, and hope that both
players don't break serve.  In tennis, play often ends up in a tie breaker
which can carry on long into the night, until one player drops from
exhaustion.  Sports games are not the ideal model for abstract games.

The notion that a game has great gameplay if you don't care if you win or
lose, or even if anyone wins, doesn't fly with me.  A game should be a
platform, not a wall.  Chess sucks.
