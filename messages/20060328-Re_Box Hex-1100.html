As long as the pie rule or some other equalization protocol is used,
it seems like it could be an interesting variant. And I apologize for
getting caught up in an adversarial conversation. Hex is my 2nd
favorite game, and I tend to get defensive about it when anyone claims
some variant is an improvement in some way.

No problem on the spirited debate.  Most of us gamers like to dispute
matters and we're generally pretty good at keeping etiquette in view.
If you like Hex and Go (I'm guessing that's your other favorite game),
there's a fair chance you'll like Tanbo or one of my other games.
Cephalopod, my most recent non-variant (February, 2006) seems to be
showing some promise, though time reveal any problems that may crop up.
 They're all played at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.superdupergames.org">http://www.superdupergames.org</a> and I always keep
challenges open there.  The server is painfully slow, but hardware
upgrades are in progress.
