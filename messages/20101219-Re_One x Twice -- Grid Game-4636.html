Because this game has such wonderful elegance,
I decided to add a C program solution
as one of the very short example programs
at my website.  So, naturally I was disappointed
when the game turned out to have strategies
guaranteed to win.

I tried various ways to upset this.  Let one player
win on prime numbers rather than odd numbers.  Vary
the size of the grid.  Let the payoff be related to
the number of X's in the grid.  Whatever I tried,
the game still had a pure winning strategy.   :-(

If anyone wants a "good" variation of this game with
optimal <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>mixed<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> strategies, you can try a 6-by-6 grid
with the first three moves dictated (a-la checkers):
  (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).
Even here, Odd's main chance is his 1-in-3 chance
to win immediately.  To make the game fair, let
Even victory be worth $1.31, Odd victory just $1.

All this is predicated on my computer program
being sound to start with and not corrupted by the
various experiments.  That's probably a much less
than even-money chance right there.   :-)
