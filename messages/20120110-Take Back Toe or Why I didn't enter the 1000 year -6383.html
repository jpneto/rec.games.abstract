Truthfully I didn't enter this contest because I had my doubts an
abstract could win. The only reason I feel some abstracts made it to
the finals was because most of the entries were abstracts. However
this ridiculous game called Take Back Toe won anyway so I have been
vindicated in my assumption that the games would not be judged on
their overall quality. I expect Nestor's shibumi contest to play out
much the same way which is why I stopped worrying about entering it. I
don't know why this trivial, gimmicky game Take Back Toe won but I'm
going to assume nepotism played some part in this. It seems James
Ernest is already an industry insider like Solis so perhaps they have
some former acquaintanceship. See what we have is a case of class
warfare here, the published vs. the unpublished. We're the 99 percent!
Oh well Nick. sorry you got screwed, Ketchup was a clear winner in my
book. I'd like to say I'm not saying I've lost all confidence in
contests, I think the RGA contest was conducted in a fair and
impartial way and I would like to commend Daniel Schultz for the
effort he invested in running it. Oh and one more thing,  Daniel Solis
can go blow it out his ass!
