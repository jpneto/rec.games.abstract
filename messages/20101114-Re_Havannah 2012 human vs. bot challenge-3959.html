What Taylor said was pretty asinine but I can't control that. I mean
I'm certainly not going to ban him because he thought the corners
being excluded as part of the adjoining edges was "ugly". The most I
can do is defend Havannah and tell him that I disagree. I'm doing my
part to keep the peace there but please let's not have this escalate.
I certainly wouldn't call it a deal breaker that Bill Taylor doesn't
fully appreciate Havannah.

C'mon, that's not the point. I couldn't care less. I <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>know<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> what
Havannah is, so what should I care about Bill's opinion. "Opinions are
difficult because they're too damn easy" remember?

What I care about is that his argument about corners in hexgames _in
general_ is paradoxical. What does he mean by "Corners have always
been a slight annoyance in connection games" ?

Within which context please? And how long is "always" - I'm sure Bill
understands the paradox here. Bill means "corners have always been a
slight annoyance in my clean pure mathematical mind" and Hex would be
circular had Bill had any say in it, I'm sure.

How can anyone whose credentials read:
Research Interests:
Probability, with emphasis on discrete probability processes and the
connection between probability and logic.

start an argument with this fuzzy statement, not to mention 'solving'
the slight annoyance.
And be above replying, for that matter.
