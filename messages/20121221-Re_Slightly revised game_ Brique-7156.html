This is correct.  I simply don't have patience for details.  If a game is organic enough, there are few details to worry about.

Dieter Stein may be overrated, but Corey Clark and Nick Bentley are both highly regarded, original designers who each have at least one very well thought of game, which is one more than most designers have, including you, Lopez.  I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.  You seem to be creative and independent, both requisites of good design but neither ensuring good design.  Not to put too fine a point on it, Lopez, but the only person you've amazed so far is yourself.  I think you have potential but you have to focus.

As has been revealed on bgg, some of your games bear a similarity to Sid Sackson's games.  Should we consider you a plagiarist as well?
