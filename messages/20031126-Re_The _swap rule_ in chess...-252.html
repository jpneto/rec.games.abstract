<br>Gosh, changing a rule will change the game. Amazing...

<br>
<br>Just in case you're really this stupid:
<br>
<br>Obviously, changing a rule changes the game. That isn't what I was 
talking about. I said it would change the CHARACTER of the game.
<br>
<br>As an analogy, suppose you change the spot for a penalty kick in soccer 
(or football, depending where you're from) by 2 yards. Does this change 
the game? Yes. Does it change the character of the game? No, because the 
strategies are still the same, the play of the game is still the same, 
and the teams that were good before will still be good.

<br>But the amount of scoring would not&nbsp; go up, which would make a better 
analogy with the reduction of draws we want in chess (assuming that is 
the goal we wish to achieve)
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>OTOH, if you change the rules so the goalie can no longer use his or her 
hands, that completely changes the character of the game. Some teams 
that were good might not be so good anymore. Scoring would go way up.

<br>Kewl. Good idea.
<br>
<br>I'd personally go for discarding the 'offside' rule, allowing for the 
basketball term 'fast-break' to enter this game. But hey...
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Changes in game play might occur that we couldn't predict. THAT'S what I 
meant.
<br></blockquote>
<br>We want a drastic change: less draws
<br>Making puny changes will not cut it.
<br>
<br>And anything else that comes with it we'll have to wait and see.
<br>
<br>Maybe the mere thought of having to play through an entire draw 
situation will make players want to avoid them more :)
