I can see the value in a random initial setup.  It keeps the opening moves from becoming cataloged and stale.  What happens though if a particular random setup is more favorable to one player?  I don't even know if that can happen in this game, but if it can, and one player objects to the opening setup, is there any procedure for objecting and re-shuffling the pieces prior to playing?

Randomness will not change the game in favor of one of the 2 players.
The probability that a starting configuration is in favour of one of the players is very very very low.
Just try to imagine such configuration! 
For experts who have enough skills I will opt for placement phase (18 moves per player!!!!).
Anyway this game is the standard one.
For now I will playtest it alone using some hypothesis then we will see how it eveolves. Lot of minor things to fix.
Thank you for the feedback.
