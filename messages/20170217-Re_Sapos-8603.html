The 2 are correct 
Sapo=frog=toad 

Instead of talking words talk about the game.
At first glance the game is deeply flawed.
Starting for a square 2x2 anywhere on the board :

pp

I can play indefinitely by jumping at left and then at right 
.pp
pp

then 
pp.

or vertically too

Ask this dumb game designer why not removing the captured piece instead of replacing it on the reserve?
There are at least 10 flaws.
Rey Alicea does not burn his "brain" more than one second.. He wants other players to design "his" botched game. He just throws rules randomly. Who knows why?
No play test! No even a little burn in the brain! Nothing!!!

You my friend are a grade a pussy, you talk a lot of shit, follow the rules and play the game or simply shut the fuck up. Not are fault your parents threw out the baby and raised the placenta.

But seriously play the game, the game ends in three possible ways, 

1) blocked into a corner
2) all of your 16 pieces are on the board before your opponent
3) Pieces that you own are separated thus unable to move

How many turns both players could play without capturing each other?
I assume that the 2 players are collaborating

Is the game sensitive to mirroring play?

There are many questions you need to answer to and for some to fix them.

In reality you did not invent a game. You have just thrown a draft hoping that others will solve for you.
You remain crappy game designer as long as you do not burn your brain and play test your game or at least some mechanics.

I will post 5 games (some are completely new games with no borrowed mechanisms) in the next few days.

I have played the game many times, the problem you are having is you are trying to play it in your head. Follow the rules and play the game then you can comment
