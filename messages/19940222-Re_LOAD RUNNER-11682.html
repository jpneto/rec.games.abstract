Hi;

This is the first time I post on the group. I am looking for a game called
"load runner". I believe it is a very very old game (at lest as old as
APPLE IIe or IIc). Also has pc version.

I asked most of peopel around. But they either gave me the wrong one or just
know nothing about it.  I tried to use Archie, but still fail.

Hey!  I love that game.  I used to have it for my C64.  Whee, those were
the days.  The only thing like it I can think of off the top of my head
is a game called Hyper Lode Runner for the Nintendo Game Boy.  The game
play is exactly like the old Broderbund version, except the screens are
different, and one level is too big to fit on the gameboy's tiny little
screen, so it scrolls around a bit.  If you find anything for either the
IBM or Amiga, please let me know, okay?

Chris
