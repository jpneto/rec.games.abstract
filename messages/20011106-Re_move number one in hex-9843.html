Same question for a similar game played on a triangle
of hexagons rather than a rhombus, where the first
player who connects to all three sides wins.

I believe this variation is called Y.  I haven't seen a similiar

I thought Y was played on a board in which most cells have 5 neighbors,
rather than 6.  Or is that called "Mudcrack Y"?

 From <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/revugy.htm">http://www.gamepuzzles.com/revugy.htm</a> :

"An early version of the game, played on a triangular 
array of regular hexagons, was invented about 40 years 
ago by Charles Titus and Craige Schensted. But both it 
and the game of Hex, on which it was based, had a 
problem: Plays near the center were so powerful that
the edge areas were largely irrelevant. Around 1970, 
the inventors added three interior points that border 
only five other points each instead of six. This 
subtle change not only caused the edges of the board 
to curve but also made the entire board important, 
greatly enriching the game's strategy and tactics."
