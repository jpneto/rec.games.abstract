I remember reading the rules many years ago (10+) and coming to the

I agree.  (But I admit that I've only read the rules, and never tried to
actually play it.)

There is a beautiful 3d chess set on the market called "hyper-chess" or

If it's the same one I saw a couple of years ago, I've played it once,
but I thought some of it was rather arbitrary.  (If you're going to put
the cells into an irregular 3-d arrangement, then why be concerned with
having exactly 64 of them?  Also, a knight can, as usual, move from point
A to B whether or not the "intervening" cells are occupied, but is this
move permitted if those cells don't even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exist<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>?  I don't think the rules
made this clear.)

It seems to me that the "obvious" 3-d generalization of Chess should be
played on the cells of a cube.  Mack's Space Chess does this, with a
5x5x5 board; the smaller radius makes short-range pieces more powerful
than in 8x8 chess.  But it can be hard to visualize the moves, and I've
been told that it tends to be draw-prone because you need more material
to force a mate.  (I'm pretty sure K+Q vs K is a win, though.  And you
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have 10 pawns to promote, so maybe having a Q advantage isn't so
unlikely.)
