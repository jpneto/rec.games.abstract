Before I reveal how it works, I'd like to find out whether I could
make some money on it.  Can one resell Legos commercially?  How about

Uh, Karl, exactly what were we supposed to get out of your post?  The mere
juxtaposition of two lines from a previous post isn't really very useful.
We aren't psychic; are we supposed to know what you're thinking, just by
your completely uninformative "hmmm..." ???

And - "reb" - Some people don't get <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>what<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ??  What is your point?

There is nothing inconsistent with the Daniel LaLiberte's desire to embark
on a capitalistic venture, and his support of the LPF.  Perhaps one of you
could enlighten us all as to exactly what you're trying to say here, because,
to be perfectly honest, I find this sort of coy innuendo to be offensive and
not at all informative.

The League for Programming Freedom seeks to provide an environment in which
people can freely write their own code without fear of legal harassment.  It
targets large companies that can afford to launch frivolous lawsuits as a
means of intimidating and bankrupting smaller companies who don't have the
resources to mount a proper defense or engage in a sustained civil suit.

I don't recall anything in the LPF charter that objects to people coming up
with unique ideas and trying to make a profit from them.

Now, either speak your minds clearly and unambiguously, or shut the f**k up!

Thank you.
