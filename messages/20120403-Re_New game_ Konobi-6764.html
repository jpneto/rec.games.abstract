The tactics are quite befuddling
at first until you realize how strong that restriction is.  I can't
think of another connection game where you have to be so wary of
illegal formations.  Interesting.

An applet could solve much of the initial 'visual dexterity' problems and in time it might become natural in over the board games. Come to think of it, there's a class of games where over the board play encounters difficulties that either don't exist or can be easily remedied using an applet. Here it may enhance clarity, in Stapeldammen it eliminates the need for manual dexterity, in Symple it highlights legal multiple placements, there must be quite a list of games that in the past would not have had a chance because of these 'over the board' complications.

Thus Stapeldammen always seemed to morph into Jenga ;-)<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/stapeldammen-588http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/stapeldammen-588http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga</a>

Of course Jenga is more or less the reverse, although an applet might be funny if you managed to get it to work.

There's no doubt that Stapeldammen benefits hugely from the computer
format.  (That is, unless you enjoy picking game pieces off the
floor.)  I played through the sample game, but column checkers games
aren't really to my taste, although I do acknowledge their tactical
depth.  I prefer regular-style checkers games, with International
Draughts and Hexdame being my favorites.

As far as Luis' Konobi goes, I think the Zillions implementation might
benefit from the following:  if you right click, all your legal moves
are highlighted.  My guess is after Konobi is played a number of
times, this really won't be needed.  But at first I think it would be
very helpful, the reason being the surprising restrictiveness I noted
before.
