Bill Taylor doesn't seem to be getting over this shit.  What do want from
me, Bill?  An apology?  Ok, Bill.  I'm...

No, Bill. I'm not sorry.  Quite simply, you started it.  When I found out
about Nick Bentley's statement that I had chased "great minds" out of
rec.games.abstract, which, knowing Nick, and with all due respect to Nick,
was an obvious reference to you, a visceral guffaw issued from my belly.  It
was completely involuntary.

Bill, you do not have a great mind.  I don't know how you got so old without
anyone telling you that, but allow me to be the first.  Maybe you're a
"great mind" somewhere else - with the drama students in your math
appreciation course perhaps.  But not here in rec.games.abstract.  Here
you're mediocre, Bill.

Instead of responding to my perceived insult against your "greatness" rofl
in kind, you upped the ante by spamming the group.  You spammed me, I
spammed you.  Bill, I never had any hopes of "getting [you] in trouble with
[your] bosses".  If there had been any chance of that, you hopefully
wouldn't have been stupid enough to wage your very public campaign of
belligerence against academic forum rec.games.abstract, behavior totally
unbecoming a professor and totally embarrassing to you and your university,
The University of Canterbury in New Zealand, in the first place.  Any of
your colleagues could have stumbled onto your bellicose rampage here at any
time, or any of your students, etc.

No, you weren't worried, Bill.  You've got the sweet deal at U of C. 
Tenure.  Right?  You're abusing your tenure and you're certainly making all
of your colleagues resent you.  Are we to believe, Bill, that this is the
first time you've embarrassed your colleagues? rofl  There is undoubtedly a
consensus among your colleagues of, "Oh great.  What has fathead Taylor done
this time?"

New readers, these are the two "private" emails from Bill's colleagues I
posted here earlier that Bill continues to endlessly lament.  As you can
see, there's nothing private about them.  They're just alarmed reactions
from two professionals upon learning of embarrassing behavior from a rogue
colleague which reflects horribly on them.

========================================
Dear Mark
Thank you for alerting me to this. I hope it is all a misunderstanding but I
have forwarded it to his head of department to follow up urgently.

Regards
Jan Evans-Freeman

Hi Mark

I can assure you that whatever's going on in your newsgroup is the
action of Bill alone, not our department or university.

regards,

Richard Brown

And now, even after all this, Bill Taylor continues to embarrass himself and
his university here in rec.games.abstract.  Show me one constructive post
from Bill Taylor in the past two months.

Please notify Bill Taylor's superiors at the University of Canterbury in New
Zealand of his conduct unbecoming a professor here in rec.games.abstract:
