As I write this, Mark Steere has removed both his original post, in which he was trying to discredit me by suggesting I was playing 'king of the hill', as well as his apology (!) for completely misinterpreting my words.

Mark is a lonely man sitting behind a little troubled window, overlooking a Grand Delusion: that he, Mark Steere, is the best inventor of abstract games that the world has ever known, and the standard against which all that live in his shadow must be measured.

I know of no writer, no artist, no scientist (except Sheldon Cooper), no musician and certainly no other inventor of abstract games who lives under a similar spell. Whether you consider inventing abstract games as an art, a science, a way to earn a living, or, as I do, a weird hobby for the benefit of others, the concept is not applicable.

I feel Mark is caught in an infinite cycle in his head, involving a father who fails to recognize the poor little spoiled brad's genius. He must prove daddy wrong! A troublesome relationship, especially if you depend on him for money. 

Now he's added cowardice to his impressive list of abominable character traits. Lonely at the bottom.
