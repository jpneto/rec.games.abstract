En España, la palabra "glorieta" es de uso corriente. Debemos de estar
anticuados... :-P

Now seriously, it looks like a great improvement on Coil.

the version where you keep playing neutrals until someone makes a loop
feels over-tactical to me, in the realm of say, go-moku.  The neutrals
are powerful and as they build up they swiftly bring the game to an
close. It typically ends for me around move 8.  That's short.

It's a bit longer if you play it on a square board with only
orthogonal adjacencies (8 stones minimum to form a loop).

This sentence inspires me a little drawless game:

- A loop is defined as the smallest subset of a chain of stones which
surround at least one cell.
- Players take turns to place stones of their own color (Black or
White) on vacant cells.
- When a loop of stones of any color (Black, White or both) is formed,
the player with more stones in it wins. In case of a tie, the player
completing the loop loses.
- If a play forms two or more equivalent loops, only the one which is
most favorable to the moving player is counted (this is necessary on
square boards, but not on hex ones).

In case you're interested, I once mentioned here a game of mine (Vogo)
which used this mechanism to claim territories. Unfortunately, I felt
it was too easy to prevent the opponent from making territories, but I
fixed it long ago with the forced use of neutral stones which could be
part of them. In the main variant, neutral stones can't be placed on
edge cells. I didn't publish this revised version out of apathy, I
guess. Besides, I am still not sure if there is any obvious strategy
to win, although the game mechanics are quite intriguing.
