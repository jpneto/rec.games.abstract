Here is gambling cardgame for 6 players based on RPS multiplayer ( <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.abstract/ufhRwoUP0DU">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.abstract/ufhRwoUP0DU</a> ).

Game name : Take All The Money

Goal of the game : to win money

Material :

24 cards for each player (6 sets of cards numbered from 1 to 4)

Rules 

Each player take his set of cards (24)

The game start 

Players bet before playing the same unit (example : 1 dollar)
Each player drop 1 dollar on the table.
Players choose secretly one card out their set and drop it on the table face visible down 
Once all the players drop their card they show simultanously their face visible up
The winner is the one who win the RPS multiplayer (read my post)
There is ONLY one each round.  
The winner take all the money on the table and all the cards played are discarded.
The round is finished.
Players redo the process until all the 24 cards run out.
At end of the game some people will win others are going to loose their bets.
This game could be player with any number of players starting from four players.

TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME WORKS.

The game is an abstract one (no randomness).

Good luck!

VERY IMPORTANT : Sorry I forget when it is tie.
When it is tie then the money remain on the table and the next bet is added to the money
