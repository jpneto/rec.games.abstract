I'd like to know about funny games (card games or games where only paper
and pen is needed) where only two players are required. Name of the game,
rules, ..., any link or information would be great.

wari, you only need stones and holes in the ground. 
Go, pente, connetrix, Go-Moku Pente (btw all connect4 variants), twixt, all 
battleboat variants, go on a small board 9x9, the big board variants are 
more serious, you only need paper and pen.

And as card game 
And backjack, poker, blackout or any 4player card game played by two is 
really funny. 
Bridge with two open heads and two players how donï¿½t know how to play 
bridge.
With backjack you have the dealer and the player.
And with poker you can use instant of money for any thing else. pieces of 
paper, little stones, pens, water, the money variant is the serious 
variant.
Blackout with three hands where one hand is constantly closed.
