Corey Clark wrote in bgg:

"No Howe I took your comment and reposted it in a slightly different
context in the hope to evoke empathy and simulate the frustration it
caused me..."

Of course.  Now it all makes sense.

"The only person being petulant here is Howe because he cannot keep up
with this argument as it ascends into the status of a mature
intellectual debate. Instead of participating in that debate, he'd
rather paint me up to be an emotional baby who got upset because he
didn't like my game. It is his attempt to do this that is the ultimate
source of my anger."

What a relief to see Corey Clark psychotically obsessed with someone
else, other than me.
