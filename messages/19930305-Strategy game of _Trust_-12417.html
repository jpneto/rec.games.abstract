[Hopefully, no one will be offended by this post being here rather than
 rec.games.design. Comparing the usual discussions, this place seemed to
 be more appropriate.]

I wanted to create a game with a very simple syntax and rules, yet would
promote backstabbing, cooperation, and trickery among all the players. I
intend to implement this on a computer. The simplicity was necessary to
hide knowledge of who would be human or computer players.

Anyway, I wanted to get some feedback on the rules. They are a little
abstract at points, but the ideas are easy to see. I have a few ideas about
what problems there could be. Here are the rules:

Rules for "Trust" (or Government, Congress.... what would you call it?)
-----------------
A game for N players, each starting with X points. The object of the game
is to get Y points (where X &lt; Y &lt;= NX).

A round is composed of the following:

  (a) There is a D (=10,15) minute period where players are allowed to
	discuss, argue, comment, and make proposals among each other. Talk
	is limited to a preset group of nouns and verbs and modifiers, in
	order to hide differences between computer and human players, to
	make programming computer players "easier", and also to provide a
	bit of purposeful ambiguity.

  (b) After D minutes have passes, discussion MUST end. Each player then
	creates Z (=3) proposal(s), which can be of the following kinds:

		"I will give to &lt;player&gt; &lt;#&gt; points."
	    or  "I will take from &lt;player&gt; &lt;#&gt; points."

	[I couldn't think of any other forms at the time.]

  (c) When all proposals are finished (possibly a time limit on that), all
	players vote for/against/abstain for all other proposals, NOT
	knowing what they are yet. The basis for their voting is personal
	choice and what they discussed among themselves (therein lies the
	fun!).

  (d) Lastly, votes are tallied. Any proposals at ties, those who abstained
	MUST vote. Any remaining ties are broken by the chairman (computer)
	who votes for the proposal with a variable % chosed by game players.
	After all proposals are decided, they are reported to the players
	and all those proposals that succeeded take effect.

  (e) Start next round......


I see a couple of problems, but the biggest one is if someone is coming
close to getting Y points. In such a situation, I imagine that no one will
vote for any proposals he makes, and no one will propose to give that person
any points. I can think of a few possibilities: (1) hide all points from
players except their own, (2) change # of votes a player has based upon
the amount of points he has (either proportionally or inversely). Neither
of those sounds terribly pleasing though.


I would really like to implement this game, and would appreciate many many
many many many many comments and suggestions for these rules. Also, anyone
who feels like playing a game by email to test it out, send me mail and I
will arrange it. If (for some strange impossibility) I get too many game
entries, I will limit the game to 20 players.

Thanks to all in advance for your patience.
