                     *** UNACHESS ***
                  Invented by Jeff Miller 
 
 
Unachess is a game that eliminates the arbitrary standard setup in chess  
without replacing it with another. (It is really less a chess variant and  
more a game that happens to use the same equipment. So no need for die 
hard chess people to get snooty for messin' with their game. Jeff is a 
master rated chess player. I'm a novice at best.) 
  

The Rules of Unachess: 
 
 1. All pieces are exactly the same as in standard chess.
 
 2. The board is initially empty and each player has the normal complement 
    of 16 pieces 'in hand'. 
  
 3. The players alternate turns. White plays first.
 
 4. During a turn, a player may do one of three things: 
    a. place a new piece on the board
    b. move a previously placed piece to an empty square 
    c. move a previously placed piece onto a square occupied by an opposing 
       piece, capturing it.
 
 5. Captured pieces are NOT returned to the game ala Shogi. Once a piece is 
    captured, itï¿½s out of the game completely.
  
 6. Pawns may be entered on the second, third or fourth rows. Pawns entered 
    on the second row have the power of an initial double move and en 
    passant as in standard chess.
 
 7. Upon reaching the eighth row, pawns may be promoted to any piece without 
   restriction. 
 
 8. Pawns MAY be dropped in to deliver checkmate. 
 
 9. Bishops are NOT required to be placed on opposite colors. 
 
10. Castling (though unlikely) is allowed if King and Rook are on 
    traditional squares, and all the normal conditions required for castling 
    exist.
 
11. A player MAY NOT make a capture until her/his own King is on the board. 
    Your pieces have no real power of check on the opposing King until your 
    own King is placed. Your opponent can legally place his or her King 
    right next to your Queen if your King is still in hand. There is no 
    additional rule governing when you must enter your King. 




Jeff has been bugging me to play this game and tell him what I think of it. 
If you want to play Unachess, just email me your first move. I do not know 
to what degree chess skill matters. Jeff played with some of his friends 
who were inferior chess players and got clobbered more than once. The games 
can be VERY quick.

All comments, ideas and suggestions welcomed. Reply by email and I'll post 
a summary here.

Some comments on the game so far:
 
 
UNACHESS sounds like an interesting variation. However, it belongs under 
a category already established in the forties, I think, maybe earlier, 
namely  Randomized Chess.  See also Unorthodox Chess in The Oxford 
Chess Companion. 
 
In my opinion, the problem with Randomized Chess, in general, is that 
the resulting positions can be so entangled, that one has a lot of 
trouble working up a real desire to try to find a solution. Yes, it's 
more like solving a maze than playing chess. 
 
--- Augustin R. Carreno 

Jeff's comment --- Randomized chess replaces one arbitrary setup with
another. Unachess eliminates the setup. As to entangled positions, yes
that's true. That's sorta the point.

I thought I "invented" something very much like unachess when I was in 
college.  The differences were these: 
 
The king must be placed on the first move. 
 
No castling. 
 
No pawn promotion, en passant, or 2-square moves. 
 
I played with friends a number of times, and we agreed that the 
positions became <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>extremely<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> complex and tangled, very quickly.  We 
streamlined it somewhat by allowing each player only one of each piece, 
and four pawns.  This helped a bit and made for a more manageable 
tactical game.

--- T. Moody

Jeff's comment --- In this variation, the second player's King will be
under attack from the outset. I believe white has an unfair advantage 
that does NOT exist in Unachess.

=====

In the chess variations I've seen, there is always a requirement that 
bishops come into play on opposite colors.  There is probably a reason for 
this, but I'm no master. 
 
There is also another rule to consider (from Shogi): Pawns cannot be 
dropped to deliver checkmate. 
 
--- Jeff Hunter Johnson

=====

While playing for the first time, I felt as if there was tension as to 
who would drop their king first. I wanted to wait as long as possible, but
still drop mine first. I think you are in good shape if you can drop your
king in leaving your opponent in check. Knights may be much more important
than in chess.

It seems to be an arbitrary restriction for pawns to be allowed to be 
entered only on rows 2 - 4. Without that rule, perhaps players would try to 
acquire multiple queens at the outset. But the ability to interpose a pawn 
can be important in this game. Jeff said he experimented with and without 
that rule and this way was most popular. What do you think?
