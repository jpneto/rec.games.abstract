How does the group rec.games.programmer fit into this?

I'd have thought it was pretty obvious that games programmers have a major
interest in AI for games (hence comp.games.ai). Indeed, for the strategic 
games, the AI can make a huge difference to the playability - many games 
just have the computer players cheat to give a good opponent, but the good 
ones play under the same rules as humans.

Discussions on AI in computer games does occur on rec.games.programmer,
and indeed, sometimes on comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic as well.

Consequently, a forum like comp.ai.games is likely to be of great interest
to some readers of these groups.

Given that the discussion about such a group would seem to be of interest 
to many readers of the group rec.games.programmer, and sounds pretty much 
"on topic" for the group, it seems pretty sensible to include it in the
groups crossposted to.

I'd think that any formal RFD's etc on this probably ought to go to
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.strategic also, but I'm more prepared to concede
that one.
