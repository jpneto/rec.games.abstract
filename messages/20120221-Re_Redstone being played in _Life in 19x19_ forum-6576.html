You may think I drove Bill Taylor out with my "despicable" act of
spamming his university.  And you'd be wrong.  All that shit was just
a blip on the timeline, preceded by years of Bill Taylor lording over
rec.games.abstract.

You couldn't help noticing everyone paying homage to Bill Taylor -
everywhere.  Not just here.  Being quoted in books.  Bill Taylor said
this.  Bill Taylor said that.  Bill Taylor, Bill Taylor, Bill
Taylor.  I went along with it at first.  There was no reason not to.
But then something happened.  I started designing more and more
games.  Bill Taylor meanwhile was doing his best not to recognize or
even acknowledge me.  According to Bill, I needed to "earn" his
respect.

And I started to wonder.  What the fuck did Bill Taylor ever do to
earn all this glorious adulation?  Eventually I began to wonder
aloud.  "What the fuck did you ever accomplish, Bill?" - the
perpetually unanswered question.

The answer boiled down to Taylor's constantly hyped "credential" - his
teaching certificate.  Lots of people have teaching certificates.
Torben Mogensen has a teaching certificate, and he too knows fuck all
about abstract game design.

Everyone was paying homage to this fat fuck, Bill Taylor, sitting on a
milk crate.  I never wanted Bill's milk crate.  I just wanted him to
stop taking up space.   But no matter how I tried, I couldn't pry him
off it.

Then it occurred to me that if Taylor is locked into never
acknowledging me, maybe I can persuade another world renowned designer
to come here - Christian Freeling.  Let's see if Taylor can ignore
Christian too.  How thin can Taylor spread his non-acknowledgment of
real designers?

Then one day Christian shows up and hands Bill Taylor his walking
papers.  Poof, gone.  Yes, Taylor gradually tapered off his bellicose
appearances in a face saving maneuver, ironically making even more of
an ass of himself.  But the moment Christian Freeling arrived, Bill
Taylor was out.  Taylor just didn't know it yet.

I goof on Christian for all his holy grail shit, but I was impressed
by the ouster.  Christian succeeded where I failed.  He cleaned up rga
without even trying.  And now we have Redstone, in its final, glorious
form.  Redstone wouldn't have happened in the Bill Taylor era.  The
climate was wrong.  Rga was a collaborative nuclear winter.  We were
up to our tits in Nim variants and nothing else because Bill Taylor
wouldn't allow it.
