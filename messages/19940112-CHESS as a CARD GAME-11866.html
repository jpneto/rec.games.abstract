here's an idea of mine which i tried to
bring to reality some years ago; 
unfortunately i wasn't able to do it
in a satisfying way.

perhaps you already know of such a thing,
perhaps you have ideas to do it,
perhaps you simply like the idea.



the goal is to develop a card game,
which can be mapped onto chess
isomorphically.

people who learn the card game and
don't know that such a mapping exists,
shouldn't be able to detect it at once,
but should be impressed of the
complexity of this new card game.

furthermore the card game should have
a simple set of rules (chess isn't
this complicated, either).


one can state a few simple things at once,
(it is a two player card game, etc),
but there are other aspects not very clear
at the moment.

imagine for example we would use a homo-
morphism instead of the isomorphism. then
every state in chess would have &gt;=1 corresponding
state in the card game. hence, the graph of
the card game will have classes of paths
through states, which are equivalent in
respect to the corresponding chess paths.


i stop here and leave some room (be sure: there
is enough!) for your thoughts.

please follow-up or reply!
