How about that, a dynamic goal connection game in the LOA tradition
(well ... tradition?). Am I right that any group could be 'slid' into
a line and travel endlessly on an endless board (even picking up 'side-
joiners' as it were)?

That's right. There are no limits on how many vacant points a group
can advance on a single turn, just the same as with singletons. And,
yes, joined units in the sides are incorporated to the moving group
(not singleton).

The game would appear very 'organic', more so than say LOA. I like
that. I don't particularly like the initial set-up (Konane, Grabber,
Cage, to mention a few that use it) but I would agree that it is the
one the organism itself suggests.

It's certainly clearer than LoA: you needn't count anything in
Raindrops to check if a move is legal or not. As for the initial set-
up, another option is the pseudo-checkered set-up for odd-sized
boards, which is already mentioned in the ruleset. As a designer, I
went for simplicity, but I wouldn't be surprised if this one turns out
to be even better.

Could you elaborate on why the 'last to finish' with one unit wins?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually, the goal is being the first player to have exactly one unit
on the board. If both players have been reduced to one unit at the
same time, the player who made the last move wins. Is this wording
clearer? If so, I'll correct that bit in the ruleset. I must admit
that I've been struggling with English to write a clean ruleset. It
was easier in Spanish :-)

It's really the same as in LoA (well, some LoA rulesets consider
simultaneous connections as draws, but that's another story).
