here's an idea of mine which i tried to
bring to reality some years ago; 
unfortunately i wasn't able to do it
in a satisfying way.

perhaps you already know of such a thing,
perhaps you have ideas to do it,
perhaps you simply like the idea.



the goal is to develop a card game,
which can be mapped onto chess
isomorphically.

people who learn the card game and
don't know that such a mapping exists,
shouldn't be able to detect it at once,
but should be impressed of the
complexity of this new card game.

furthermore the card game should have
a simple set of rules (chess isn't
this complicated, either).

Hi.
It seems to me that it might be possible to overcome the both the problem
that card games tend to involve luck and the problem of hidden cards simply by
dividing the cards into suits before the start of the game. Give two suits to
each player. This way, as in chess, each player knows where the other is
starting from and no luck is involved in the setup. Maybe that oversimplifies
things, however. Good Luck.
