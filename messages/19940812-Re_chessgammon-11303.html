 &gt;In the recently posted rules to chessgammon, it is stated that the rules 
 &gt;for castling and en passant capture apply "in the obvious way."  Castling
 &gt;has subsequently been explained.  Darse, please tell us how en passant
 &gt;capture works.  

Sorry, I was wrong to have assumed the rules would be obvious, since
not everyone plays both chess and backgammon.  By trying to be brief,
I left too many gaps -- thanks for the questions.

 &gt;Must a 1 be rolled and used on the first roll after a pawn is double-advanced,
 &gt;or can the agressive pawn be captured at the first subsequent opportunity?
 &gt;With a white pawn on e4, black pawn on d6, if black rolls 1-1 and plays d6-d4,
 &gt;and white rolls a 1, can he capture en passant?  And with a white pawn on e4,
 &gt;black pawns on d5, c7, if black rolls a 1 and plays c7-c5, and then white rolls
 &gt;1-1, can white play d4-d5-c6 capturing en passant?

En passant is only possible when the opponent's pawn has used it's
two square jump option with it's initial move.  The rule exists to
prevent a pawn on an adjacent file from evading capture with the
double move option.  Hence our capturing pawn will always be on the
fifth rank (relative to our own back rank), and the enemy pawn will
have used the double move to land directly beside our pawn.  To
capture that pawn, we pretend that it moved only one square forward,
and make the usual diagonal capture, removing the enemy pawn from the
board.  The en passant option is only available once, on the move
immediately following the enemy pawn's double move.

In chessgammon, all the same criteria must be present.  With respect
to en passant, the two opponent moves on the previous turn are
considered to be simultaneous.  So if the opponent makes two moves,
one of which is the two square pawn move vulnerable to en passant,
the actual order of those two moves is irrelevant.

Example 1: White pawn on e5.  Black pawn on d7, bishop on c8.  Black
rolls 3-1 and must move a bishop, and chooses d7-d5 Bc8-f5.  Even
though the pawn had to move first, White may capture the d pawn if he
rolls a one next turn, with e5xd6 (ep).

Example 2: White pawn on e5.  Black pawn on d7.  Black rolls 1-1 and
choses to make two one-square moves, with d7-d6 d6-d5.  This pawn is
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> vulnerable to en passant capture, because the two move option
was never used.  On the other hand, if Black decided to play d7-d5
d5-d4, the pawn <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>would<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be vulnerable for the next White roll only.
 
 &gt;Much as I love the en passant rule, I submit that it serves no particular
 &gt;purpose in chessgammon.  Nevertheless, I do love it.  I suggest that the rule
 &gt;by the following:  A pawn which moves more than one square on its turn, either
 &gt;by double-advancing from the second to the fourth rank, or by moving twice on
 &gt;a throw of 1-1, may, if the next throw of the dice is appropriate, be 
 &gt;immediately captured by an opposing pawn which attacks any of the squares 
 &gt;through which the first, fast-travelling pawn has moved.  Interestingly, this
 &gt;rule would allow long strings of consecutive en-passant captures in certain
 &gt;circumstances.

En passant situations do actually occur regularly in chessgammon, and
can even be decisive.  In one game, I had a White pawn on d5 and a
bishop on f4, attacking the Black King on d6.  Black rolled a one,
and blocked the threat by moving his pawn from e7 to e5.  I rolled a
lucky 3-1, and won the game with d5xe6 (ep) Bxd6.

The basic idea behind en passant could be generalized to apply to
rolls of 1-1, but I don't really see much advantage in this extra
complication.  I'll try to remember this option during future games,
to see what difference it would make and how often it might arise.

 &gt;I look forward to trying out this interesting game soon.

Thanks for your comments.  This discussion has already been helpful,
since I now prefer playing with the first roll pawn-move options
described previously.
