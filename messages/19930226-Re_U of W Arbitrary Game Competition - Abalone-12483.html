Q: Why the KO rule? I have the original board version of Abalone,
and there is no such rule in the board version of the game.
If it has been added to avoid endless repetitions, what's the problem?
It's up to the programmer to put some randomnesss in his program
if he wants to avoid draws this way. When neihter of the programs
does anything to avoid endless repetitions, it's a fair draw, isn't it?

I'm not connected to the competition, but I have some guesses for the
answer:

The two questions are related: if you allow repetitions, you must have
an upper limit of the number of moves to decide the outcome of the
game. If you don't allow repetitions, there is a natural (if huge)
upper limit to the number of moves in a game. My guess is that the
organizers prefers to solve the problem by a Ko rule rather than
putting an arbitrary limit on the length of the game. Chess has opted
for the arbitrary limit solution, but in a slightly roundabout way:
there can only be a finite number of moves between irreversible
changes.

I actually haven't played Abalone before (though I might try now), so
I cant say which solution is best, but my guess is that I would prefer
the Ko rule. Ko rules tend to reduce the number of draws in a game. In
Abalone there can be no draws if the Ko rule is used: it is impossible
for both players to lose their 6th marble simultaniously, and they can
not avoid captures indefinitely, as there are only a finite number of
configurations for a given number of marbles so eventually a player
will be forced to capture or repeat a position.

This, however, leads to a question: what happens if a player is unable
to perform a legal move? That is, any move he can make will repeat a
previous position. Does he lose?
