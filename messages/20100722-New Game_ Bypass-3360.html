Hello all,

Bypass is a connection game for 2-6 players.

You may find complete rules at the following link:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75816/bypass">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75816/bypass</a>

The board consists of a hexagonal grid of hexes. Six hexes, located
along the outer edge of the board, are labelled with a letter.
Players, on their turn, add a path of their colour that connects two
adjacent hexes and a wall that blocks a path from being built there.
In addition, players may convert a path to a wall and a wall into a
path. Eventually, the six lettered hexes will be connected by a
network of paths. At this point, the game ends. There will be three
scoring routes on the board. Each scoring route connects a pair of
letters and usually contains paths owned by more than one player.
Players score one point for each path they own along each route. The
player with the highest score wins.

Thanks!
Raymond Gallardo
