I doubt it. There are many theorists of chess who can't actually play the

I disagree. Any proof to back this up? And remember, "many," not just
an isolated case or two.

**By all means doubt, Steven. I suppose my proof is my direct experience.
But I am sure this is not a satisfactory answer to you, since you match my
generalism with your own general quare on it.

What I mean is that there are 1500 rated players who know more of some lines
than I do, but who I defeat by move 10 - and I supposed out loud that just
knowing the lines is not the same as understanding the relative merits of
the positions.

I suppose it is in the definition, but I would not accept a 1500
player as a theorist, not would I agree that they "know more" of some
lines - unless you mean rote memorization. But if you beat them in 10
moves, well, how many "lines" last that few moves? if lost at move 10,
they would have had to commit a serious error by that time.....

A theorist would have to be someone who knows a lot about theory, or
generates new theory - just my definition, but I think it is
reasonably accurate.I've not known anyone below Expert/master level in
playing ability who could also be considered a "theorist."

You would perhaps also accept that theoretical knowledge in chess, or
anything else, is different from an ability to use that knowledge on demand,
in a competitive situation?

"Ability to perform a task does not signify an understanding of that
task." - SBD, around 1995 or so..... the inverse strikes me as true as
well.

But also time controls, physical fitness, nerves....


I thought you were talking more about such people as Zuckerman, Rolf
Schwarz, Gruenfeld, Korn, Cheron, whose chess playing ability did not
match their theoretical knowledge and contributions (although Zuck
gets unjustly slammed as too much of a book monkey - I've seen his
games, and the won games still had to be won).
