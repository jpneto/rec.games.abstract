IMHO, you can arrange three kinds of world championships, human only,
computer only, and mixed. This is certainly true for both chess and
checkers, and I think it woul'd be quite silly to try and forbid any
of them.

In practise, it is of course an open question what kind of championship
that different organizations will want to arrange, and which kind that
will be considered most interesting.

Not true. Jonathan Schaeffer's team (Edmonton, Canada) is working on
solving more and more positions for their Checkers position library,
(used by the Chinook program). This is a huge task, but according to
the posting by Robert Lake, they seem to be half-way.

No true either. Samuel's programs were a great step forward for the
early sixties, but their play is mediocre by current standards. Any
simple (and non-learning) program written according to current
knowledge will play far better.

The reason that Samuel is so praised is that he pulled of an early
successful learning result. But what was written in those days must
be reevaluated before you compare with today.
