There are several difficulties facing anyone who tries to discuss
abstract games, especially in a forum about abstract games.

What did I bring to the world of abstract games? A couple of good
games.
What did I take? Nothing.

An example of what I'm facing. I posted some reflections on the Star
theme and the parameter involved at the Arimaa off topic forum:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/forum/cgi/YaBB.cgi?board=other;action=display;num=1236541162;start=280">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/forum/cgi/YaBB.cgi?board=other;action=display;num=1236541162;start=280</a>

I ended with:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Finally, here's an idea for wannabe inventors: What if the parameter
were set to a negative number?
In other words: what if the count were of the general form "number of
(such and such) points, plus '2n' points for every group", where 'n'
is natural? Obviously connecting groups would be <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>disadvantageous<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.
I'm satisfied with Symple, but I'm sure there's a game there,
somewhere. Have fun."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just an offer to consider the implications: a possible 'disconnection
game' if you like. Then I get the following reply:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I don't understand. Just after Forum Admin has declared that one
should not bait people to violate forum rules, we get a disrespectful
notion of "wannabe".
 From <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe</a>
A "wannabe" (slang for "want to be") is a person with an ambition to
be someone or something that they are not. The term is mildly
pejorative, intended to convey the foolish nature of the desire due to
the incompetence of the "wannabe" to accomplish the goal.
Of course, it could be that the above definition does not capture what
you meant. I would just hope that you clarified it. Mark's comment
"don't encourage them" supports my understanding that there is hint
that others are not as capable to design good games.
All this is in good spirits. I am just baffled, that's all."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in a 'polite' spirit.
My <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>conduct<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is politely questioned.
My <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>motives<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> are politely questioned.
And finally there seems to be a hint that we're not all equally good
at inventing games.
Oh horror!

But all in good spirits of course.
Not in the spirit of the article, however, that was about the effect
of changing the value of said parameter. The suggestion to consider a
shift into negative values, was directed at anyone who might want to
invent an abstract game. No value judgement implied.

But the sheer <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>suggestion<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> that I might have wanted to imply the
notion that not everyone is equally gifted, is enough to distract
attention from the subject, in favor of my 'behaviour'.

And guess what: <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Not_everybody_is_equally_gifted_at_whatever<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>!
But that has nothing to do with my article or my suggestion.

Now this isn't all that serious, but it shows how one must weigh every
word or have one's motives questioned, or one's behaviour questioned,
by simply sharing insights and asking nothing in return.

The symple mechanism that eventually turned out to be an independent
meta-mechanism, not restricted to the particular Star theme in which
it had revealed itself, has meanwhile only attacted the attention of a
few people - the rest was too busy not discussing abstract games.

One of them, currently lurking at r.g.c., is Benedikt Rosenau
(Zickzack). He's an expert, especially in the field of Draughts
variants, and he was also the one who kept pressing me about the Star
theme and the 'missing game' therein. I mailed him immediately after I
had remembered my vision of the symple mechanism, the previous night:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"You asked for it, so don't complain if this works ;-)

Take a hexhexboard, two players, first move swappable.
On his turn a player has two options, and he may use either or both or
neither.
Def.: a group consists of one stone or two or more like colored
connected stones.
Option one: Put a stone on a vacant cell, thereby creating a new
group.
Option two: Grow every existing group by one stone. A stone connecting
two groups is considered to have grown both, so a stone may not
connect two groups if one of them has already grown in that particular
turn.
Option one, if used, precedes option two.
The game ends when the board is full (a vacant cell will always be
advantageous to at least one player).
The count is the number of stones minus two points for every group.
Hexhexboards have an odd number of cells, so the score cannot be
equal.
A first move in a corner is obviously worse than one in the center,
hence a swap will have a balancing influence.

First question obviously: is there something wrong?"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To which he answered:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hi Christian,
And a wow. You changed the multimove approach into something less
fixed, with effects that can be "configured" during the game. A
strange and fascinating race should ensue. Generally, I do not like
games which have to be played until the last breath, but here it is
different, and the multi-move makes it quick.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Option one, if used, precedes option two.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I guess that just means: if you start a new group, you may not grow
your other groups.

Amazed,
Benedikt"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was a wrong guess, because in my vision the organism did still
sprout and grow simultaneously, but it didn't take me long to see that
reigning it in the way he had understood, would lead to what
eventually turned out to be the central dilemma the mechanism implied.
So credits to Benedikt for spotting this aspect of it before I did.

An important second aspect is that the symple mechanism is a meta-
mechanism, adaptable to a number of themes, as shown by Symple,
Lhexus, Charybdis and Sygo, none of which were taken notice of, under
the Christmas Y tree.

I started with "several difficulties facing anyone who tries to
discuss abstract games".
Here's another one. When I say the above is interesting, my motives
are not to share insights.
I'm just glorifying my work.
