The Scoop: I'm fishing around for a Masters Thesis Topic in Computer Science.
I'm interested in working up a program for a game, but not of the typical
search variety.  One vague idea that I've been toying with is to work on a
game where each piece could have a mind of its own and limited information
about the overall game.  Centralized-but-slow strategies could be contrasted
with strategies where less information is shared between pieces, so small
groups can act fairly independently and quickly.

Such an approach obviously wouldn't work with games like chess, where only
one piece can move at a time, so a fully-coordinated approach is needed.
However, a game like Icehouse
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.wunderland.com/icehouse/IcehouseTOC.html">http://www.wunderland.com/icehouse/IcehouseTOC.html</a>) has several features
that lend themselves to my approach.

So what I'm asking you, dear reader, is for interesting games (from an AI
standpoint) with simultaneous movement or time-sensitive games in which
several pieces have the option of moving on any given turn.  Also of interest
are other nondiscreet positional games, where there aren't "spaces" per se.

Thank you for your insights interesting pointers.
