Problem 1:  H (Horizontal) to play and win
       7 - - - - - - - 
      6 - - V - - - - 
     5 - - - - H - - 
    4 - - - V - - - 
   3 - - V H V - - 
  2 - - - - - - - 
 1 - - - - - H - 
  A B C D E F G 

Most people said H-C4, but that loses to V-E2.
H must play D2.  Then he can connect the left
edge to the D2 unit (this is the hard part), D2
to F1, and F1 to the right.  I.e., H answers any
of the labeled plays below with another play
in the same set, in order to preserve his links:

       7 a - - - - - - 
      6 a a V - c c c 
     5 a a a - H c c 
    4 a a a V - c c 	Decomposition after H-D2
   3 a a V H V c c 
  2 a a a H b c c 
 1 a a a - b H c 
  A B C D E F G 

Why is the LEFT-D2 link secure using the points
marked 'a'?  Because H has two threats, C2, which
links using the points marked '*' below:

       7 - - - - - - - 
      6 - - V - - - - 
     5 - - - - H - - 
    4 * - - V - - - 
   3 * * V H V - - 	One way H threatens to link LEFT-D2
  2 * * H H - - - 
 1 * * * - - H - 
  A B C D E F G 

and C4, which uses a similar set of points:

       7 * - - - - - - 
      6 * * V - - - - 
     5 * * * - H - - 
    4 * * H V - - - 	Another way H threatens to link LEFT-D2
   3 - - V H V - - 
  2 - - - H - - - 
 1 - - - - - H - 
  A B C D E F G 

The only hope V has to stop both threats is to
play at the intersection, namely A4.  H-C4 then
forces V-B5, followed by H-B4 forcing V-A5,
followed by H-B2 and H links up.

       7 - - - - - - - 
      6 - - V - - - - 
     5 V V - - H - - 
    4 V H H V - - - 	Position after A4 C4 B5 B4 A5 B2
   3 - - V H V - - 
  2 - H - H - - - 
 1 - - - - - H - 
  A B C D E F G 

Congrats to John Tromp, the only correspondent who gave the
correct solution (his proof was less wordy too).

My Hex program solves the above problem in about 30 seconds
(on a DECstation 5000) (4323 nodes of search), using analysis
very similar to the above.

Problem 2:  Horizontal to play and win

       7 - - - - - - - 
      6 - H - - - - - 
     5 - - - V - - - 
    4 - - - V - - - 
   3 - - - - - - - 
  2 - - - - - - - 
 1 - - - - - - - 
  A B C D E F G 

At first glance I was confident that V was winning, but H can
just barely stop him.  The key moves are H-E6 and H-D3, and the
order probably isn't important.  After H-E6, H threatens
to win at C7, and V will have to play there (or near there) to
stop him.  V might first want to play a forcing move against
the E6-RIGHT link, and it turns out there is only one potentially
useful forcing move to be played there, namely V-F5.  (I won't
explain the analysis of useful forcing moves here, but note that
V-G4 is met by H-F5, after which that G4 stone isn't going to be
useful to V.)  V has no useful forcing moves against the
LEFT-B6 link.

       7 - - - - * * * 
      6 - H - - H * * 
     5 - - - V - * *
    4 - - - V - - * 	H's E6-RIGHT link.  V's only good forcing move
   3 - - - - - - - 	is F5; any other * move would be locally refuted.
  2 - - - - - - - 
 1 - - - - - - - 
  A B C D E F G 

So let's say V plays F5, H responds at F6, then V plays C7
(or equivalently C6, D6, B7, or D7).  Now H plays D3:

       7 - - V - - - - 
      6 - H - - H H - 
     5 - - - V - V - 
    4 - - - V - - - 	H wins, but it's still complicated.
   3 - - - H - - - 	In some sense, V's moves are forced to this point.
  2 - - - - - - - 
 1 - - - - - - - 
  A B C D E F G 

This is a won position for H, but I can't find a concise proof.
There are some tricky lines; e.g., against V-B3, H must play C2.
I'll leave the rest of the analysis as an exercise for the reader :)
My program did 8600 nodes of search before claiming that all V
moves lose.  Unfortunately, when I ran it on the original problem,
it clunked away for twenty minutes and then seg faulted :(
