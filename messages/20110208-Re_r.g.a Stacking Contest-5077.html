THE FUCK WE DO.  MAYBE YOU NEED THEM.  I DON'T.

If you guys want to have a popularity contest, move it bgg, a much more
appropriate venue for popularity contests.  It doesn't belong here in
rec.games.abstract.

I left RGC precisely because of the "we-among-us" mentality. I'm a
games inventor. I invent games for people who like abstact games. If
there's a contest I need them to vote and hope the best game wins.
Obviously 'the best game' depends on a range of criteria that will not
precisely match mine, or yours. It may even differ depending on the
context: 'the best game' may not be the best game for a competition
like this one. I submitted Grabber because it is easily accessible,
and playing a few games can give a fair impression. That's all part of
the territory. If you 'don't need voters' because there's a presumed
conspiracy to prevent MQ from winning, then you underestimate the game
or the voters or both. If you think MQ should win because you think MQ
should win, then there's not much anyone can do about it except asking
you to read that sentence again.
