So why does anyone bother entering?  Perhaps because they /like playing
Chess/?  people who like playing will often like watching, and will
appreciate quality play whether or not it ends in a draw.  A draw is an
outcome reflecting similarly good play on both sides: it is fair and is
not necessarily dull.

What is important to understand is that a tournament is a version of a
game, and it will get gamed by people to maximize their chances to
win, irregardless of what each game calls for.  If a scoring system
rewards draws more, there will be more draws.  It goes with the
territory.

Good points! In fact, if scores for draws are the same as averaged win/lose, 
then there is no particular emphasis on avoiding draws, or playing for a win 
<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>in terms of scoring<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> - and other factors become important; Andy Walker 
mentioned ratings as one factor, and the other is one's position in any 
tournament, or how feisty you feel.

To follow the language above - if the scoring system rewards draws with 
black more than white, with 0.6 and 0.4 of a point respectively, will that 
factor disrupt 2 things? (a) if players collude to draw they do not get the 
same reward , and (b) will it produce less draws overall by stimulating the 
white player to fight on, and not draw?
