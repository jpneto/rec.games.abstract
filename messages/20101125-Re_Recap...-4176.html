Of course  :)  My point was not that I like to sadistically beat my opponent
as badly as I possibly can.  It's just that in Quadrature, normally a brutal
game of annihilation, when an opportunity presents itself to cut and run for
the goal, you do it, unhesitatingly.  And it kind of seems like a cop out in
a sense.  Hard to explain.  I've got a challenge open at GamesByEmail
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamesbyemail.com/">http://www.gamesbyemail.com/</a>) if you're willing to give Quadrature a try..
You will almost certainly be brutally annihilated though, lol

I'll take the risk. You have still a Symple game open against
Benedeikt by the way (albeit with 'group penalty' set at 2 instead of
the usual 4):

Well, before Havannah landed at LG and the computer guys came in,
there was only a rumour of a draw that had once occurred.
When the programs started on base-4 boards, and eventually got better,
the first real draws would tickle in (both bot v bot and bot v human).
Now we've had them at base-5 too, and one base-6 if I recall
correctly. Still thousands of games base-7 and up, without a single
draw. That's interesting I think.

Yes, I agree.

[DISCLAIMER: Christian, if it ever seems like I'm picking on you or your
games or your principles here, I'm not.   I may have strong views which
directly contradict yours, but they aren't intended to diminish.  Consider
Amazons by Walter Zamkauskas.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>love<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Amazons, but I would never have
markers being placed on squares.  Not intended as a put-down.  It's just
that I can appreciate things that aren't my thing.  I'd be bored to death if
everything was my thing.]

So, in all probability, would we ;-)

If you (Christian) had a bunch of grandmaster hopefuls studying your game,
that base-8 base-9 business would be going through the roof.

Meaning more draws would occur? I really doubt that there will ever be
any significant number of draws upwards from base-7, but time will
tell.

Sorry about the rambling nature of this, but - that being said - I'm not
repulsed by infinite games.
