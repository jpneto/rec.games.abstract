Easy to create a chess variant.
You play chess with all the classical rules but you add a new capture mechanics.
Queen can not capture an opponent queen
Rook can not capture an opponent rook
Bishop can not capture an opponent bishop
Knight can not capture an opponent knight 
Pawn can not capture an opponent pawn
King can be adjacent (orthogonal and diagonal) to the opponent king.

All the gameplay will change! 
Why? Because pieces are going to be used as blocking pieces.

Try it! 

I hope you will like it.

It's been done already. I actually looked at this because some think you are a decent designer, and if you hadn't been anticipated, I might have suggested you offer it to the chessvariants.org website. The best I can get out of this is now you seem to be using Kanibalno capture as a mutator, a la JP Neto. But it's been done. In fact, the inspiration for the anticipation is the Lion, an extremely powerful short range shogi piece: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/lion.html">http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/lion.html</a>
