Heya Mark!  What magazine did you read this in?  If it's not available 
here in North America, can your forward a photocopy or whatever, if I pay 
postage?

No problem, just email me your address. Here's a summary:

The article was a single page in Games &amp; Puzzles magazine, issue 66
(Nov/Dec 1977), entitled "Do we need simpler chess?".

It outlined two chess variants, the first of which was invented by A. Wardley
and played on a 6x6 board. The reduction in size is accomplished by removing
two pieces from each side. So you could play a game without the bishops 
(i.e. the starting lineup is RNQKNR), which apparently increases the strategic
importance of the knights, or without the knights, which changes the role of the
bishops. Removing the rooks means castling is impossible, and the inventor even
considers a variant in which the two missing men are the king and queen!
(In this game you are "morally obliged" to promote a pawn to a king in order to
give your opponent a chance to checkmate you. It's not clear from the article if
the inventor actually played any of these variants himself.)

The second chess variant is called "Petty Chess" and was invented by B. Watson,
who described it in a letter to the British Chess Magazine in 1930. This is
played on a 5x6 board, formed by omitting the two middle ranks and all the
"duplicate" pieces on the queen's side of the board. (So the starting line up
is QKBNR.) Mr. Watson reports that the game makes for some pretty endings.

On the same topic, Martin Gardner describes a 5x5 version of chess in chapter
eight of his book "The Unexpected Hanging". Here the starting line up is KQBNR.
Gardner also describes draughts/checkers on 4x4 and 5x5 boards, and Go played
on a 3x3 grid.

On a related but different topic, some weeks back someone posted details of
how to obtain a copy of David Pritchard's forthcoming book "An Encyclopedia
of chess variants". I omitted to note these in good time, could the original
poster please re-post?
