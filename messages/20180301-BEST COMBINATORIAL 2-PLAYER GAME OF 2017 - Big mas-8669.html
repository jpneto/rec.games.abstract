Every year they (whom?) reward the crappiest abstract games.
But this year is a special one : reward will even go to plagiarized games.
For now I can not stop laughing because all this circus is full of manipulation.
For sure there will be no sexual scandal or something like that (example Oscars and so on) but who knows what is done behind close doors.
Is is easy to know the winners.
Read the ayatollahs`s comments and you will know long before who the winners are.
But be sure that no rewarded game in such contest will be played more than once (and less if we removed in the list the game designer).

You are invited to applaud and applaud and applaud.
Your job is to applaud and that`s it.
Les des sont pipes depuis le debut.

This year the organizers will introduce a ceremony in some hotel or something like that financed by Nestorgames!!! ha ha ha 
When you lack credibility you buy it!!!
