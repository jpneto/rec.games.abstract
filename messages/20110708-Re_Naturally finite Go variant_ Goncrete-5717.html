Yes, I do. My aforementioned Paper and Pencil Go was compared to
Kropki by the fellows at Sensei's Library, and was in fact partly
inspired by it. In my opinion, however, Kropki's fundamental idea is
better applied in Zheng Wang's Rin, a subtly different and more
elegant game:

It has a 'means to an end' simplicity that may well work and after a
while it will probably even feel natural. So I'm not saying it's a bad
game, certainly not. But I doubt if Go players will deem it better
than Go.

I doubt it too, partly because even I am not as confident as to deem
it better than Go, and partly because Go players usually love ko
fights, even if the ocurrence of ko implies the eventuality of
superko. I won't deny that Goncrete tactics are somewhat simpler,
mainly because snapbacks are trivial to figure out, but otherwise
creating life requires about the same effort than in Go, which is
roughly halfway between Paper and Pencil Go (capture ensures life) and
Reversi Go (capture never makes life).

As you can imagine, Reversi Go is simply Go with an othellonian
capture, disallowing suicide so that making true life is not
impossible:

Intriguing how sekis can secure life so often in a game which is,
apart from that, as unfriendly to life as the planet Jupiter :-). That
kind of life is also possible with suicide allowed, of course, but the
game would probably be trivial.
