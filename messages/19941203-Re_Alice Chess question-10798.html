I agree with rhk; it seems to me that, logically, en passant is capturing
the "virtual pawn" that moved one space instead of two -- and hence is on the
second board, just behind the real pawn.  In other words, white moves
e2(home)-e4(second), and black moves d4(second)-e3(home), which captures the
white pawn on e4(second).

The trouble is that e3(second) might already be occupied, in which case
black's move either makes two captures at once (if the occupant is white)
or is illegal (if black).

I think that's the best decision here.  But then, I never really liked
the en passant rule anyway; it's a kludgy solution to a non-problem caused
by a rule change that shouldn't have been made in the first place.
