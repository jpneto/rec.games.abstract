Of course, you saw postings for Arimaa...
I am going to run Zillions on it to see how well it handles it.

How well it handles it?  Aren't you really testing many things at once?  How
well it was implemented in Zillions; how well you yourself play Arimaa; how
well you are able to eliminate your bias with regard to Linebreakers....  I
don't know about that last one, but I am honestly curious how you plan to
adjust your analysis for the first two.  Are you going to have Zillions play
itself?  That would tend to get rid of the second concern.  Note that I have
not asked how you plan to determine that Zillions is qualified as a testing
ground--my own bias is that Zillions is perfect for such a test, assuming
perfect input.

I wanted to see how competently Zillions played the game.  Apparently
the designer of Arimaa says it doesn't play a good game, as expected. 
I am curious how well Zillions will play my Linebreaker game.  I would
need to code that.

The developer of Arimaa actually ported over the game to Zillions...
