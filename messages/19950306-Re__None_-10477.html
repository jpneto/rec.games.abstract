I think you can prove the unsolvability of this problem with graph theory.
Use the theorem that a path going through all points is only possible if
there are max. 2 points with an odd number of exits. (Can't remember if it
was an if or an if and only if). Use as points the middles of the squares,
and as exits the lines you have to cross. Then the upper left point has 5
exits, the upper right point also 5 exits, and the down middle point has
also 5 exits. Therefor there are 3 points with an odd number of exits. Hence
the puzzle is unsolvable.
Only left to proof the theorem, which is used. I think you can find that
proof in a book about graph theory.

It's in fact trivial. The line starts and ends in at most two regions. Look
at any other region: the line must enter it a certain number of times, and
leave it the same number of times: each entering or leaving crosses one edge
so the number of edges must be even. For the same reason, the number of edges
of the regions the line starts and ends in must be odd (unless it starts and
ends in the same region, of course).

In fact the above diagram has four regions with odd numbers of exits: remember
to count the outside.
