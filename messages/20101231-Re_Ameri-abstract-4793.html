lol, Gert, sorry about the non-confrontational European/German complaint. 
Like I said, I've been to Germany and found the Germans to be a lovely,
friendly people.  They're no more or less confrontational than the rest of
us, and they're no more or less humor...  Well, moving on.

(just kidding)

I don't know how or why the whole non-confrontational game philosophy got
started but it was silly from the outset, and has progressed to become
obnoxious.  Now it's Ralf Gering, stereotypical boot snapper from the cast
of Hogan's Heroes, saying "Oh, we're above aggression.  Games of aggression
are for aggressors like Americans."  Yes, we're aggressors because we can
be.  Not real complicated.

A small introduction for Gert: Gert runs a game review website, the link to
which I can't seem to find now.
And Gert is my number one play partner at Flume at iggc.  Thanks to Gert
I've started to understand the game, and how awesome it is to play.
