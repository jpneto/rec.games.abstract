Intriguing.  Questions:

Thinking about the rule that only the player with the most checkers
showing gets to make omni-directional moves.  On the one hand, it
seems like a rich-get-richer mechanism, because the player who already
has the advantage of having the most checkers showing earns thereby
all the extra degrees of freedom imparted by the omnidirectional
moves, but at the same time, a reverse move takes a player farther
from his goal, so it's hard to gauge the value of reverse moves (a
fact I like).  Do you find them to impart a strong advantage to the
player who can use them?

What would the game be like if a player can only make omnidirectional
moves when she has <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fewer<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> checkers showing than her opponent?  If
having fewer checkers showing is a disadvantage, but having the right
to omnidirectional moves is an advantage, then this rule might lead to
a nice strategic trade-off between showing checkers and
omnidirectional moves.
