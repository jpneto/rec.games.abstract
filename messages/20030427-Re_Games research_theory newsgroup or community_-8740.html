Huh. I never heard of "game researchers" before. Except possibly folks like
Stewart Culin and Sir William Henry Wilkinson, who combined their interest
with games with their interest in anthropology or cultural studies
(international relations) -- and thus provided some of the earliest known
records of the game of mah-jongg (see

1. I wonder what's the purpose of this research, if not for the purpose of
deriving (designing) new games...?

2. You can always have a discussion with designers that isn't specifically
about design but is completely, totally, and obviously relevant to their
activity.

alt.game.research.

You have two choices: have these discussions in existing forums (like one
for designers of games - and yes, perhaps players of games as well), or
start your own forum.  The process of making a newsgroup is not that easy,
and nobody else is going to do that work for you.  Why don't you go ahead
and start your discussions now (I still recommend rec.games.design). Then
once you've gotten a passionate enough group, then go ahead and start up the
new forum.
