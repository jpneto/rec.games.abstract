|&gt;    Sorry if this is the wrong newsgroup to post this to...  If it is, could
|&gt; someone tell me where to post?  Thanks!
|&gt;    Last summer, I learned a game called 'Mao' from some people in a summer
|&gt; camp.  The basic idea is similar to Uno, but there are many rules involved and
|&gt; associated actions.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  I need to know more
|&gt; rules (I only have 20), and this is only the beginning...  E-mail back if you
|&gt; know anything about this game.  Thanks in advance!

	I am very familiar with this game but I'm not sure if posting the rules
is a very good idea.  You see the game is extremely fun, esp. with a large group
of people, but only if a fair portion 25-50% DON'T KNOW THE RULES.

	At least that is the way we alwasy played.  It is also of vital 
importance to have a good dealer, one who is EXTREMELY impartial and not
at adverse to screwing with people :)

	However, you are right in that it is very uno-like.  (that in itself is
probably giving too much away :)  Remembering back to when I first played it
is very fun trying to figure out what the hell is going on :)

	IF you are wanting the rules to start playing with others who don't 
know email me and I'll mail you a set ( Or at least as much as I can remember,
its been a few years).  Though I strongly discourage anyone from posting the
rules here. ;) It would take all the fun out of someone who might later play it.
