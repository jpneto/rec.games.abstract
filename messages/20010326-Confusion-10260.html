a fascinating game, but the games are too short! For experienced players
Zertz will eventually only consist of an opening and an endgame phase.

Maybe. I think your comments are a bit too simplistic unless you have
first-hand experience.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


First hand experience? I played the game and afterwards I analyzed some of
the games I played. A game took hardly more than thirty moves (Japanese
count). First you have lots of choices (rather Go-like and fascinating),
but then you have less and less. Zertz will probably develop a rather
Fuseki-like opening strategy (i.e. no fixed moves as in Chess but opening
lines as in Go) that soon is followed by an endgame

Ridicoulous to define chess variants according to these rules. The goal is
to capture one or several pieces or stalemate the opponent. Since we could
as well take all pieces as the defined goal, we get another chess game in
Checkers, and yet candidates are Abalone and Octi.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You should better think first and re-read what I have written.

I declared that the goal of "chess" variants is to capture some DEFINED
pieces. It doesn't matter whether they are called king, osho or gipfs.
Draughts belongs to a different group of games where you capture all
stones. This group is further divided into many "families", for
instance, there are games in which you capture only your
opponent's pieces (this group is further subdivided) and games in which
all pieces belong to both players (or none of them -- depends on
your point of view) when you start the game (Mancala variants - this group
also consists of several categories).

The goal in Octi is not to  capture pieces but to control certain squares.
Capturing pieces is just a means to reach a goal as in Go connections
are a means to make territory (but Go isn't a connection game like Y or
Twixt). You do constantly confuse the goals with the means.

There are only two possible classifications systems of abstract board games:

1rst: a historical approach (doesn't work well with modern games)
2nd: a logic approach based on ONE common feature of all games: I decided
to chose the goal (object) of the game. Every game has a goal, a way
to win or to lose. Usually people mix all these systems together and
get an arbitrary artificial system which is neither historically nor
logically consistent. My system is logically sharp as a knife, but it is
a-historic.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
One of the other standard requirements to chess games is to have various
different properties for the pieces. So, with the potentials, Gipf is
starting to look slightly more as one. (In the stanard tournament version
there are only 2 kinds of pieces)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This of secondary importance. BTW Schachdame "feels" like Draughts but is
a chess variant --  you don't have many different pieces in this game.
Forget about all this marginal things and come to the essentials! You need to
have a focus or this will just be another arbitrary system. This is typical:
to get lost in details. One time you stress 3-in-a-row, then a connection,
then the mode of capturing, then the goal (territory) and so on. I don't
want a to use an unscientific subjective system, but one which is logically
stringent -- and unmerciful like a law of nature. And my hypothesis was
that the goal of a game is its most essential characteristic.Next I
analyzed the different goals and tried to find out the essential
differences between different "capture" games, for instance. But it's not
essential how you capture, but what you capture.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Another is to require that the pieces move 1 by 1 on the board and capture
by replacement. Of course this is not true in Gipf either.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


which is not true... In Senterej (Ethiopian Chess) there is no move
1 by 1 during the opening phase and in Shatra (Altaian Chess) pieces do
not only capture by replacement. All your (pseudo-)requirements
are not really essential characteristics of chess variants.

Abalone
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The player having the first move is said to have a sure win. The game
doesn't sell well after the winning strategy was published on the
internet.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have no idea what you are talking to, nor which version of Abalone this
is. The problem with the original version was that it is too easy for one of
the players (usually the second) to block the board and give a draw. (see

players usually do not have any more restriction either in Othello or
Reversi. Still, it seems more appropriate to call the game Reversi, which
afaik, only differs slightly in the starting setup.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is no starting set-up in Reversi (the board is empty). You get two
different board positions after the first four moves are played in
Reversi, one of them is the starting position of Othello. So what are you
doing when you play Othello? You introduce a four-move restriction (i.e. a
fixed starting position you would get after 4 moves). Come on, this is a
very simple logical analysis. They call it a starting position, but in fact it
is a 4-move restriction!

Pente
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually the Japanese traditional board game Ninuki Renju, but with
primitive backward rules that give the first player a sure win (if you
really play good).  The only true rule change compared to Ninuki Renju as
played in Japan 100 years ago is that White starts while in Japan it is
Black. Very original indeed!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, I have no idea what you are talking about. I sure hope you explain
things like this more clearly in the book you say you are writing. "backward
rules"? There is a 2nd move restriction for the 2nd player, and with this
restriction the game feels like a slight first player advantage still for
casual players, but essentially not noticeable. For stronger players I think
it is around 60/40 in the first players favour.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A Pente world champion said there is a sure win for the first player.

The Ninuki Renju rules restrict the moves the first player is allowed to
do much more. Why? Because they found out in the 1920s that the restrictions
they used before (and are still in use in Pente) are not enough to balance
the game.
