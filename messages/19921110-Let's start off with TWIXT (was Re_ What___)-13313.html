Sigh.  Doesn't anybody read the newgroup messages anymore?

Anyway, to begin, has anybody started working towards a theory for the
old AH game TWIXT?  I haven't been able to work on it because I suck at
playing against myself with any kind of honesty, and I seem to be able
to crush anybody else I play against by just starting off with this
simple strategy and then playing reasonably until I win:

O = RED (opponent) (moves first)
@ = BLACK (me)

Note: only the central portion of the board is shown in this diagram.

           RED

   . . . . . . . . . .        1. RED plays.
   . . . . . . . . . .
B  . . . . . . . . . .  B     2. I play so as to block his longest possible
L  . . . . O1. . . . .  L        doublecross move
A  . . . . .\. . . . .  A     3. RED, eager to get a bridge, fails to
C  . . . . . O3. . . .  C        play with tempo.
K  . . . . . . . . . .  K     4. I jump out with a large doublecross and proceed
   . . . . @2. . . @4.           to march toward either of my goal sides.
   . . . . . . . . . .           Anytime one of my doublecrosses is threatened
   . . . . . . . . . .           I just fill it in.

           RED

I understand that the simple way for RED to attack me is to try to turn
the tables by playing, say, 3 at 4, but not having found opponents that
also realize this has prevented me from being able to work out what
happens beyond that point.

So, does anybody already know if this is a first- or second-player win?
If not, how about some more data on how the game progresses during an
even match?

Also, I'm not going to attempt to describe this game called HexMeister,
but I would like to hear from anyone who has heard of it and played it
and found a way for the second player to be in any position other than
totally hosed from the beginning of the game.  Thanks.
