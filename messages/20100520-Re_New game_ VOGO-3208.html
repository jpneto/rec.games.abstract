Yes, I knew your old saying, and I agree with it. No bad idea can be
succesfully patched in a way that does not feel a bit artificial. It
is tough, but true.

The point is that I'm not sure whether mine is a good or a bad idea. I
was just expressing my most pessimistic view when I talked about
trivial and overly defensive play. In fact, it is apparent that the
game starts to be overly defensive at the point where an attacking
player can't surround a territory faster than the other player fills
it, thus making it impossible to take advantage. The turning point
occurs at territories whose area (territory) equals its perimeter
(surrounding stones), i. e., 4x4 territories. Thus, it is probable
that, say, a 19x19 Go board provides enough room (or rather chances)
to create several 4x4 or bigger territories, making for an interesting
game. It is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>probable<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and my limited playtesting suggest it, but...
who knows?

Anyway, Mark, I appreciate your frankness and advice.

Any comment about the variant I suggested in case the main one is
broken?
