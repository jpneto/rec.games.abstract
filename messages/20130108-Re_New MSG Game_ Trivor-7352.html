Yes, it is 'drama'.  "Boo hoo, Mark Steere criticized Symple."  You've dredged up the exact same criticism countless times already.  

Why have I "pre-determined" that Symple sucks?  Because it requires a calculator, and because there are a huge number of moves per turn on average, making it opaque.  You've overpromoted Symple as a "great game", a "perfectly balanced game", a "quintessential game", ad nauseum for years on end - all bullcrap intended to mask a bad game.  You bet the farm on Symple, and you lost.  Now you wander the ghetto of abstract games, destitute of credibility, pissed off at the world for "conspiring" against Symple.

Nobody but you has yet spoken in favor of Symple in all these years.  Your fellow Dutchmen have programmed it out of Dutch loyalty.  And you've convinced fellow European ninnyhammer, Luis, that Symple is "perfect" in some perversely misguided sense.  But everyone else simply ignores Symple, in spite of you relentlessly prodding and browbeating them for failing to understand how "great" it is.

Do you recognize creative genius when you see it, Christian?
