lol, Is this for the imaginary readership who didn't witness you ripping

I hardly call an entreaty to, who I thought was a reasonable person,

game in which I shit all over the board self-serving.

It's not too late for the truce, as far as I'm concerned, but it needs to be
extended to all respected members of the abstract games community, including
most notably Christian Freeling.  Tone it down.

lol it's not like the truce was a huge relief for me or anything.
Flame away if you want. Christian Freeling needs to "tone it down" now
he's moved this dispute elsewhere on the internet, that's bad enough
but he's dragged me in to it just to facilitate the joke which is
pretty lame in the first place. I think I'll just make a game called
Christian Freeling Loses His Shit and let this dispute go.

Christian you need to think CRITICALLY about what you are doing. I
apologized for my insulting remarks directed towards Query and as I
recall you accepted that apology. Even if I hadn't apologized or you
hadn't accepted my apology this goes beyond some flaming in a news
group, it's practically defamation of character. What's so bad about
leaving my name out of the description of the design process for this
game? Can you tell me that? It's not lying if you simply leave my name
out of the description. I'm not even that upset that you provided a
link here, at least people might see me trying to defend myself then.
