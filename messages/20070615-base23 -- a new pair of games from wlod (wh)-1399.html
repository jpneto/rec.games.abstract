Let

    n = Sum(b_k(n)*2^k : k=0 1 ...}

and

    n = Sum(b_k(n)*2^k : k=0 1 ...}

where b_k = 0 or 1, and t_k = 0 or 1 or 2,
be the unique positional representations of
natural number n, respectively binary
and ternary. Define:

    B(n) := Sum(b_k : k=0 1...}

and

    T(n) := Sum(t_k : k=0 1 ...}

to be the sum of digits, of binary or
ternary respectively.

Game base23, or rather its both versions,
start with a natural number  n_0.
Players alternatively choose on their
i-th move either

    n_{i+1} := B(n_i)

or

    n_{i+1} := B(n_i)

Now consider the "base23, go 1" version:
you WIN, when on your move you reach 1.

And the other game, "base23, stay big",
you LOSE when you reach a number &lt; 3,
i.e. 1 or 2.

Please, I am not joking. These are TWO
games, not one. If I were jokin' I'd supply
you with :-). Yeah, right! :-)

EXAMPLE of a game:

Pos.  n_dec n_bin  n_tern  (move B/T)

(P0)    10    1010     101

(P1)     2       10      2    (either)

Comment: the first player had accidentally
only one choice, since  B(n_0) = T(n_0) = 2.

If they were playing the "stay big" version, then
the first player would lose at this very moment.

If they are playing "go 1", then the first player
loses anyway, because now the 2nd player
can play:

(P2)     1      1      1      (B)

Can you solve this game for special
number-theoretical cases? E.g. for

    n_0  :=  2^b * 3^t

*******

Needless to say, both base23 games can be
generalized to any finite set  X  of positional bases.
If c is the largest positional base in the set, then
the "stay big" version is, by definition, lost to
the player who ends up below c. Call these games
base_X.

Actually, both versions of base_X can be played
for any set X, finite or infinite, of the bases, with
the additional rule-requirement:  n_{i+1} &lt; n_{i}
for i=1 2...

Of course, this additional rule means that
you may use only the positional bases
which are \&lt; n_0. Nevertheless, the notion
of infinite bases is useful because it assists
us in defining special classes of "base_X"
games. E.g. you may have  X := P -- the set
of all primes, or  X := {2^k : k=1 2...) -- the
set of powers of 2, etc.

Enjoy,

    Wlod
