Man stop blaming everyone for your shitty game.  Accept some

I didn't blame anyone for the game's creation. I'm just saying the
players were certainly more enthusiastic about Canvas than I was. Yes
in fact one of them was so enthusiastic he wanted to program it for
his site....

I'm sure you'll find this hilarious but I'm asking myself the exact
same question. Anyway what the fuck do you think I mean? Nobody is
designing in quite the design constraint prison cell you are. This is
the source of integrity that I was talking about in the other thread,
but really, who gives a shit about your integrity anyway? The players
certainly don't, they just want a fun diversion.  In fact I highly
doubt anybody (besides you of course) gives a shit besides myself.
Nobody really gives a shit, besides you  that you can shuffle all the
pieces around on the board in Arimaa every which way without anything
ever happening because nobody plays Arimaa that way! Nobody is ever
going to play Arimaa like that. You're dealing with a bunch of
philistines who couldn't give a rats ass about how theoretically
finite or draw-free your games are. Come on, I thought you already
knew that...

You're in denial because the only possible rationale you could have
for your design process is that it fills some absurd psychological
imperative that nobody could give a flying fuck about.
