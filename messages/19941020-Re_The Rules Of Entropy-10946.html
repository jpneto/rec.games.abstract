:  
: 	--&gt; RULES:

: 	1. A piece can move only if it is next (incl. diagonally) to one
: 	of its own color.  When this is satisfied, you may move it any
: 	number of empty squares, in a straight line, and in any one direction.

: 	2. If you have a piece that is next to neither one of its own, 
: 	nor one of the other color, then you are in check, and can play to 
: 	clear the check only. If it can't be done, you must pass.

: 	3. The objective is to disperse your pieces so that each one
: 	ends up next to pieces of the other color only, not their own.

: 	------------------------------------------------------------------

: May I suggest, however, some slight tidying up of the wording. The use of the
: "check" concept is unnecessary, and may be confusing.  It could be thus...

: 	1. A piece that is (diagonally or orthogonally) adjacent to one
: 	   of its own color may move any number of empty squares in a straight 
:            line in one direction.

: 	2. If at the start of your turn you have a piece that is adjacent to no
:            pieces of either color, then any play must leave a situation where
:            you have no such piece. If this can't be done, you must pass.

: 	3. The winner is the first player who gets all his pieces adjacent to
:            at least one of the opponent's and none of his own.


  I'm not so sure this is the same game.  My interpretation of the 
original "check" rule would read something like:

   
        2. If at the start of your turn you have a piece that is adjacent
to no pieces of either color, then any play must leave that piece adjacent
to some piece.  If this can't be done, the player must pass.


     The difference being a situation where you have an isolated piece
and a move which fixes that but isolates another (previously unisolated)
piece.  Perhaps a better way to state the rule is:


       2.  It is illegal to leave any particular piece isolated for
two turn in a row.  If this cannot be avoided you must pass.

     An obvious variant is that you just lose when this happens.  

: However, neither these nor the original rules are complete, in that these
: situations are not made clear....

: (a) if a player has a legal move, is it compulsory to move, or may they pass?

  I would tent to think yes, but I have no strong aethetic pull either
way.  Whichever leads to a more interesting game.

: (b) if a situation is achieved where BOTH players have a winning position as
:     in rule 3, who is the winner, or is it a draw, or does play continue?

  I think this is likely to be common.  So it should probably be a win
for the last player to move.

: (c) if a situation is achieved where both players get an isolated piece as in
:     rule 2, then neither may legally move again!  Is this to be a draw?


 Here I feel very strongly it should be a draw.  I don't think this will 
be easy enough to achieve to destroy the game ... it might even add to it
(ala perpetual check).  

: If you have not decided on these matters yet; may I earnestly suggest that
: (b) is made so that the player who just moved is the winner; and that (c) is
: forbidden by making it illegal to form bi-isolated positions.  As to (a) I have
: no special preference one way or the other.

: It looks like a fun game!  I like the "isolated piece" rule.  Can't wait to
: try an email game with someone, once these ambiguities are cleared up.


 Ok, go first.
