I once suggested a variant of Othello where each piece has a cross on it
which can be oriented either as and X or as a + (which influences in
which directions it can be the endpoint of a flip) and where the player
that places or flips a piece decides the oriention.  This will greatly
increase the size of the game tree, as each square now has five
different possible values instead of three.  It also greatly increases
the branching factor, which was the primary concern: Othello is great
for computers due to the low branching factor (which makes deep
brute-force search possible), so by increasing this, I hoped to bring
humans into the competition again.

Has this variant ever been played? In anger? It sounds very interesting.
