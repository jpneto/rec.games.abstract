CHARTER

  rec.games.chinese-chess (unmoderated) will be a common forum for discussion
  of all aspects of the game of Chinese chess. Chinese chess (also known as
  "xiangqi" or "co tuong") is a game similar to western chess &amp; shogi, but
  with its own unique pieces, board, rules, and strategy. It is estimated that
  Chinese chess is played by about a billion people. Many books have been
  written on this game, but most of them are in Chinese &amp; Vietnamese. There
  are some available in English &amp; western European languages. A short list of 
  topics which could be covered in this group:

  --      Proper play in the opening, middle game, and end game
  --      Tournament announcements &amp; results
  --      Software
  --      Chinese chess in the arts
  --      Club locations &amp; creations
  --      Chinese chess sets
  --      Famous personalities
  --      Books, magazines, &amp; related materials
  --      Rating systems
  --      Organizations


RATIONALE

  Chinese chess is played primarily in the Far East &amp; Southeast Asia, and is
  growing in popularity in Europe &amp; North America. Although a few of the
  pieces are similar to those in western chess, the two games are
  substantially different. At present, serious and sustained discussion 
  related to Chinese chess is severely hampered by the lack of a newsgroup 
  specifically devoted to it. Discussion appears sporadically on the 
  above-mentioned Crosspost Groups, but due to this fragmentation, many 
  enthusiasts cannot add to or benefit from these short bursts of activity. 
  A newsgroup devoted to Chinese chess will play an important part in bringing 
  together enthusiasts who can share their knowledge and improve the current 
  level of interest, understanding, and organization.


STANDARD VOTING INFO

You should send MAIL (posts to a group are invalid) to

      <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:votes@geoworks.com">votes@geoworks.com</a> 

(just replying by MAIL to this posting should work, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>if<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> your
newsreader honors the "Reply-To" line in the article header). Votes
sent to other addresses will be discarded.  Your mail message should
contain one and only one of the following statements:

      I vote YES on rec.games.chinese-chess
      I vote NO on rec.games.chinese-chess
      I vote ABSTAIN on rec.games.chinese-chess

You may add a comment, but anything other than a definite statement
involving the group name and "yes", "no", "for", or "against" on a
single line may be rejected by the automatic vote counting program.
If you later change your mind you may send in another vote, which will
automatically supersede all previous votes. "ABSTAIN" votes serve to
cancel previous votes.

Standard Guidelines for voting apply.  For the group to be created,
100 more YES votes than NO votes must be cast, and 2/3 of all valid
votes must be YES votes. "ABSTAIN" votes are not counted in either
calculation; their only role is to cancel previous votes.

Every vote will be acknowledged by EMail. The CFV will be repeated
once; the 2d CFV will contain a "bounce-ack", i.e. a list of people
whose ACK messages bounced when I sent them.
