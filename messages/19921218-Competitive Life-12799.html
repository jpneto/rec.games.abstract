This is in response to a recent post regarding the idea of competing
finite automata.  Several years ago, there was a program of this
nature published in Compute's Gazette for the Commodore64 and Vic20.

It was entitled 'Tetracrystals of Veluria'.  The idea was that you
placed crystals of varying colors around the board and saw which one
eventually survived.  If I remember correctly, each crystal went through
at least 3 stages, dormancy, reproduction, and death.  I can dredge
up the rules if anyone is interested.
