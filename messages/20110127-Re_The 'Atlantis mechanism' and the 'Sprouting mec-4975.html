Mu features the Atlantis mechanism in that the top layer of the board, called 'Virginity', is cleared to reveal the bottom layer called 'the Commonwealth'.

Uh oh, I'm not sure I want to play a game where the players must lose
their virginity.  At least I'd be awfully careful about who I played
it with.

Lol, I was waiting for that :D Indeed, 'exploding a virgin cell with
an oversized stack' may invoke associations with 'far from abstract
games'.
The reason Mu is so little commented on is its epic character,
resulting from a single organism in a layered environment. Mu is my
Magnum Opus, but for all my presumed credibility, few have succeeded
to derive the organism's unique character and oneness from its rules.
Who can blame them. Few have even managed its rules :)
