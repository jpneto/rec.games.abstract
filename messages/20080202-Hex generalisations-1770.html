Oh, and I see that you talk about a "Whopper infinity" below. If you
DO find a rigorous way to enumerate all possible games that share (one
or more of) the properties of chess and checkers, I will certainly
recognize it as a generalisation of both, and a pretty impressive one,
too.

Ohhh, ok.  So Whopper isn't "rigourous" enough for you.  But Mind
Ninja is rigorous, why?  Because it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>almost<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> shares one property of
Hex?

You know perfectly well that that's the essential properties of Hex as
YOU see them. If you step back, you see that Hex belongs in a family
of games we can call symmetric connection games (along with your
Crossway, for instance, which looks like a really neat game). But all
games in this family also belong in the broader family of ALL
connection games, where asymmetric ones also can exist. All these
games in turn also belong to the even broader category of shape-
building games, because a connection is just a shape.

MN has ALL of the games in that family as subgames. And unlike Hex as
a subgame of Y, the interesting subgames _can be reached in actual
play_. That's not a requirement, but it's pretty impressive. Move
order advantage is handled the way it's usually handled in connection
games, the way you do it yourself, with a pie rule.

Atoll is really clever, don't get me wrong. I just think it's annoying
when you try to boost your own achievement by denying and disparaging
what others have done.

BTW, I share Nick Bentley's idea of generalisation above, except that
I demand that the set be defined in "set-builder notation" - according
to the properties the elements (and only the elements) have in common.
You have done that to my satisfaction with Atoll. You have not done it
for your "Whopper 100" games.
