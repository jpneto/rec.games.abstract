|&gt; 	It would be interesting to see how this program would function with
|&gt; some chess variants taken at random from World Game Review #10 (which con-
|&gt; tains 600+ variants). 

That would be fun.  However, while the class of games is fairly general, 
it is  not possible to represent (easily) the idiosyncracies of many games
within the current grammar for symmetric chess-like games used by Metagamer.
Anyone who is interested is encouraged to get the code for the program,
which is available from ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:users/bdp/metagame3a.tar.Z
(warning: the code is in PROLOG).

|&gt; 	How does the program determine the value of a piece when the values
|&gt; of certain pieces can change radically in the course of a game?  I humbly 
|&gt; suggest that the value of a piece can be a rather nebulous concept at times.
|&gt; 	In Unambiguous Chess, the rules state that a piece can only be moved
|&gt; if its move can be written unambiguously with three alphanumeric characters.
|&gt; Therefore, you can't move, say, N-B3 if there is more than one way of doing
|&gt; this. This rule has the peculiar result of making a piece worth almost as
|&gt; much (maybe more, sometimes) as two pieces of that kind would be worth. 
|&gt; 	Piece values cannot necessarily be added. When computing the value
|&gt; of a pair of bishops, it definitely makes a difference whether or not they
|&gt; are on opposite color squares.

Yes, there are many ways to improve upon the use of a static set of 
linear piece values. The static piece values developed by Metagamer 
for a given game are just one component of its evaluation function, 
as discussed in my thesis. 

Extending consideration beyond just a single game (like chess or checkers) makes
the necessity for this even clearer.   It also provides a way to demonstrate the
improvement in strength across a class of games by adding, for example, 
dynamic considerations to an otherwise static program.   Such experiments
are also discussed in the thesis.
