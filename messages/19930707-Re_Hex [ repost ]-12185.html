winning strategy posted by Torben AEgidius Mogenson:

There may be a winning strategy for the second player on the Nx(N-1)
board, but I would be quite surprised if it's a simple one.

I certainly remember a claim that there is a second player win, I believe in
one of Martin Gardner's old Scientific American columns. Based on my memory
and Torben's description, the strategy is basically to divide the board into
two equilateral triangles, regard the two triangles as glide-reflections of
each other to get a pairing of hexes in one triangle with hexes from the
other, then play a "mirror" strategy.

E.g. for the 6x7 board:

 A B C D E F f
  G H I J K k e
   L M N O o j d
    P Q R r n i c
     S T t q m h b
      U u s p l g a

Whatever your opponent plays, play the corresponding letter of the other
case.

I haven't checked this strategy in detail, but a quick inspection of various
possibilities suggests that it is impossible to connect the two short sides
of the board without passing through both the upper- and lower-case versions
of some letter. Since the game cannot be drawn, this is enough to prove a
second player win.

Anyone got a succinct proof that you can't connect the two short sides
without passing through both the upper- and lower-case versions of some
letter?

I did write a "trick" program using that approach in 1976. (The way the
board was displayed you couldn't directly tell that one side was shorter)
It worked very well. The funny thing is: when the player played a "good"
game, the ending was always very "close" and the program seamed to play
very skillful. :)
