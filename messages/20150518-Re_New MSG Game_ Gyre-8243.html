Hi Mark,

I have another fear.
The game is maybe easy to solve.
I mean the winning strategy is somewhat tricky. 
Either you "surround" your opponent either he surrounds you.
The best way to win is to play "sparse". As you are the first player you will have hudge advantage. 
To understand what I want to say you simulate the game by playing randomly.
My first thoughts for now.
Not deep but some sort of sketch.
I think that with little AI no human player can beat a computer.
Good luck to you anyway.
