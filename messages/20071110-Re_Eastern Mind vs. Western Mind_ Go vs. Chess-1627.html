<br>Agreed. In any case, the difference between Go and Chess is not that 
between east and west, since both are of Asiatic origin. Furthermore, 
Chess, in one form or another, remains pretty well the national game of 
Asia. While both are equally Asiatic, Wei-qi (the ancestor of Japanese 
Go) is more specifically Chinese, so the contrast is between China and 
the rest of Asia rather than between Asia and the west. Indeed, until 
about the middle of the 19th century "The West" has hardly come up with 
any original game of its own.

<br>In the case of both Chess and Go, some individual was probably messing
<br>around with some equipment which was used for some purpose other than
<br>game playing, and discovered the simple mechanism and principle that
<br>would form the basis of the game.

<br>I should think that this, in one form or another, accounts for the 
origin of nearly all games.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>&nbsp;Something resembling a Go board and
<br>Go stones may have been used for divination.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Possibly. Stewart Culin, the 19th century ethnographer and games 
researcher, made great play of the divinatory origin of board and table 
games, but I think he went a bit overboard on it. It certainly seems a 
likely explanation for Wei-qi, as it is supported by documentary 
evidence, but there are many other possible source activities for other 
games. Think, for example, of accounting and book-keeping devices, and 
surely Mancala owes something to seed or bean planting?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>What I'm getting around to is that a Chess-like game and a Go-like
<br>game were designed by two different individuals, people found them
<br>entertaining, and the games evolved, probably Chess more so than Go,
<br>while retaining their essential identities.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It may be misleading to think of the origins of traditional board games 
in terms of individuals. It is natural for us to do so because we live 
in an age that has become extremely conscious of the significance and 
importance of individuality. Folk games, like folk tales and folk 
dances, are perhaps better regarded as the products of cultures and 
communities rather than of individuals.
