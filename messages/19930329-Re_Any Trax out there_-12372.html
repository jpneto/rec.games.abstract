Yup.  There's some trax play out there.  I even played a couple net
games of it by email.  The notation we used was to mark the corners
of tiles with a plus (+) and then label the edges of the tile with
eks(x) or oh(o) --- since both tiles must match at the edge this is
never ambiguous.  As a further visual aid, we placed a slash or a
backslash on tiles with two cruves.  Here is a sample board position
created on the fly:

               +x+x+o+
               x/o\x\o
               +o+o+x+
               x x\o\x
               +o+x+o+
               x\o o/x
               +x+x+x+

In the above position, oh has just beaten eks.

For those unfamiliar with the game: each player is assigned a color, and
an infinite stock of the two types of tiles (cross and curve).  A cross
connect opposite sides (one pair of each color), and a curve connects
adjacent sides (one pair of each color).  Note that each tile contains
BOTH colors, so it is not possible to play with adding to the amount of
your opponents color on the board.

The object of the game is to complete a circuit of your own color or
force/trick your opponent to do it for you.   If a move causes circuits
to be created for both colors, then the game is a draw (some variants
consider this case a win for the player who moved, others call it a
loss)

Each player, in turn, places a tile on the board, adjecent to some
previously played tile (except the first move, of course, where there
is no previously played tile).  The tile must match color at the edge.

If this play causes a space which has not had a tile played on it to
be touch by the same color on two sides, then the player must take a
bonus move to fill that square with the tile which legally matches
those two edges (even if that causes his opponent to win).  This may
in turn create other squares with no tile played touched on two sides
by the same color.  The player must continue making bonus moves until
no such squares exist.

Other variants include limiting the size of the board and placing some
restrictions on the placement of the initial tile.

Contrived example:

Player eks:

+x+
o o
+x+

Player oh:

+x+
o o
+x+
o o
+x+

(Note that is okay for oh to extend eks's track)

Player eks:

+o+
o/x
+x+
o o
+x+
o o
+x+

Player oh including bonus moves:

+o+     +o+     +o+o+
o/x     o/x     o/x\o
+x+x+   +x+x+   +x+x+
o o\x   o o\x   o o\x
+x+o+   +x+o+   +x+o+
o o     o o/x   o o/x
+x+     +x+x+   +x+x+

Player eks makes a dumb move:

+o+o+  +o+o+
o/x\o  o/x\o
+x+x+  +x+x+
o o\x  o o\x
+x+o+  +x+o+
o o/x  o o/x
+x+x+  +x+x+
o\x    o\x/o
+o+    +o+o+

Exercise for beginners: Can you find oh's winning move?
