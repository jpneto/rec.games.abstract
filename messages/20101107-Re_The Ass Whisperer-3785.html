BGG is apparently a terrible place to have a discussion about
"game design". ... BGG is just a shambles in general and I can
find few redeeming qualities for it. The abstract forum appears
to be nothing but perpetual circle-jerking over the same handful
of games.

You got that right, this place [rec.games.abstract] is a mess! ...
Many of us agree that this site is dead ... This place couldn't be

It seems the abstract games community has failed to accommodate your
delicate sensibilities, Clark.  Maybe you belong at Richard Hutnik's IAGO
forum, lol

Man, you have zero integrity.  You gush all over my games in private, asking
me when I'm going to "pass the torch", and then you come here and publicly
rant about how irrelevant I am.  Which is it?  You speak through your ass
everywhere you go!  Corey Clark, the Ass Whisperer.

Listen pal you can keep your fucking torch, I say a lot of shit in the
iggc chat boxes, how could I possibly mean all of it. It's not so much
that you are irrelevant, but just about everything you have to say is.
And it's hilarious that you don't even realize this. BGG is golden
compared to the current state of this place.
