No it isn't, there's a clear definition. If a tree contains no cycles
it is as far as this topic is concened 'finite', otherwise it is
'infinite'.
If we consider games that contain cycles, we can distinguish two
classes:

1. Games in which cycles can be induced and perpetuated by one player,
against the will of the other. Think of 'perpetual check'.
2. Games in which cycles can only be perpetuated if opponents
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>cooperate<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> towards that result.

This has nothing to do with 'presuming to know a game's behaviour'.
It's a clear distinction, which is not to say that every game can
easily be classified as one or the other. Volo for one is a game that
I would <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>assume<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to be soft finite, but I've not proven it.

But what I see more and more
often is games being designed without practical finitude explicitly in
mind being called practically finite afterward without any data to
support this claim and in the case of Volo or Pylyx or whatever a
ruleset that doesn't even suggest soft finitude.

As said, I'm suggesting Volo might be soft finite, I never claimed
anything the like about Pylyx because frankly I don't know.

Here's an example of a clearly soft finite game that I gave at Arimaa,
to illustrate the idea of soft finitude:
Take a Chess board and place a black pawn and a white pawn somewhere
around the center. The pawns move and capture as usual, but have the
additional option of moving one step sideways. What do we have? The
smallest possible Jump Sturdy endgame.

- If the pawns are in opposition, the player to move can only move
sideways and can be captured.
- Otherwise one pawn will be first to reach the back row and win.

Despite having cycles, the game is finite.
On practical grounds: one player can always win.
On philosophical grounds: to perpetuate a cycle <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> players would
have to make sideways moves ad infinitum. Thus they would not pusue
the game's object. In fact they would be playing a non-zero sum game,
not Jump Sturdy. So as far as playing according to the object goes,
Jump Sturdy is just as finite as any non-cycilc game. The same may
hold for some other games that contain cycles.

This being said, I must admit that finitude has never been a major
concern to me and I don't subscribe to the 'drawless and finite'
philosophy, but neither do I object to it, and I'll gladly admit that
it has rendered some remarkable games, including your own Slither.

No it will not, not even practically.
