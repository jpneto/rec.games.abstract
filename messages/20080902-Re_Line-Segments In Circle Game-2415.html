<br>It is also the first of your games to which I suspect applicability

<br>Draw a circle on a piece of paper. (Preferably the circle is drawn
<br>with a compass, but this is not necessary. The circle should be drawn
<br>carefully, however.)
<br>
<br>Put a dot at the circle's center.
<br>
<br>Players take turns drawing straight line-segments (preferably with a
<br>straight-edge) within the circle as follows:
<br></blockquote>
<br>Given the rules, the circle can be replaced by any simple curve
<br>of strictly positive curvature.&nbsp; That is, the curve would be the
<br>boundary of a convex shape and would include no straight segment.
<br>For the center we may use any point of the interior.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>*A segment can go from the dot at the circle's center to the edge of
<br>the circle.
<br>
<br>*A segment can go from {an intersection of another segment and the
<br>circle} to {another intersection of a segment and the circle}.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I advise combining this into a single rule (R1) and making it explicit
<br>that these are the only permissible moves.&nbsp; It would make sense to call
<br>these two kinds of moves "radii" and "chords".&nbsp; We should probably have
<br>a simple name for those points on the circle to which radii have been
<br>drawn.&nbsp; For the time being, I'll call them "used points".
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>*A segment can pass through at most ONE line-segment that has already
<br>been drawn.
<br></blockquote>
<br>The fact that this rule (R2) applies only to previously-drawn line-
<br>segments makes the possible ending diagrams depend on order of moves.
<br>For instance, the move sequence
<br>&nbsp; 1. OA, 2. OB,
<br>&nbsp; 3. OC, 4. AC(crossing OB),
<br>&nbsp; 5. OD(crossing AC)
<br>could not be played with moves 4 and 5 interchanged, because AC could
<br>not be drawn crossing OB and OD.&nbsp; This suggests a variant ruleset in
<br>which (R2) is replaced by
<br>&nbsp; (R2') No segment may cross more than one other segment.
<br>which would prohibit move 5 above.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>*A segment can not coincide with a previously drawn segment. (ie. Two
<br>segments can coincide at at most one point.)
<br>
<br>*A segment cannot be drawn from the center to the circle that is 180
<br>degrees away from the segment last drawn by the other player, if the
<br>last segment was drawn from the center to the circle. (This prevents a
<br>player from simply matching the other player's moves, and so
<br>automatically winning.)
<br></blockquote>
<br>Calling these (R3) and (R4), another alternate ruleset would
<br>replace (R4) with
<br>
<br>&nbsp; (R4') No two radii may be collinear.
<br>
<br>I suspect this ruleset would be more tractable, because it removes
<br>the entailment inherent in rule (R4).&nbsp; (Entailment is the restriction
<br>of moves depending on the immediately preceding move).&nbsp; It would also
<br>simplify (R3) to prohibit drawing a segment that had previously been
<br>drawn.
<br>
<br>While the rules appear to permit a continuum of positions,
<br>the description of a position can be simplified.&nbsp; Let A,B,C,...
<br>be symbols for the used points, except that we denote by x' a used
<br>point that is 180 degrees from a used point x.&nbsp; We also denote by (x')
<br>an unused point 180 degrees from a used point x.&nbsp; The actual positions
<br>of the points is then irrelevant; only the circular order of the symbols
<br>x, x', and (x') matters.&nbsp; In addition, we would record which segments
<br>xy (or xy' or x'y') had been drawn, and which arcs of the circle are
<br>traversed by two chords, thus prohibiting further radii.&nbsp; In order to
<br>enforce rule (R4), it is also be necessary to note the last move if it
<br>is a radius.
<br>
<br>If rule (R4') is used, we would not need to use symbols x' or (x').
<br>Instead, we would only have to record which pair of neighboring used
<br>points are separated by more than 180 degrees, if any.
<br>
<br>The rule for drawing chords is simple: a "neighbor chord" is a chord
<br>between two used points that have no intervening used points.&nbsp; A
<br>"crossing chord" is a chord between two used points that have exactly
<br>one intervening used point.&nbsp; An undrawn neighbor chord may always be
<br>drawn.&nbsp; An undrawn crossing chord may be drawn if and only if the
<br>intervening point has no crossing chord.&nbsp; No other chords may be drawn.
<br>
<br>I'm adding rec.games.abstract to this reply, in hopes that someone may
<br>be able to attack this with the theory of impartial games.&nbsp; Perhaps
<br>entailment is not quite the bugbear I fear, and rule (R4) can be dealt
<br>with as well.
