 And for Calvinball, I don't remember anywhere in the strip where Calvin
or Hobbes flat-out contradicted a previous rule or where one gave two
consecutive rules.  Seems like they would be rules(probably unspoken
because they are well- known)to the game, otherwise it wouldn't really be
playable.  Also, they never set a condition which makes themselves
automatically the victor that I know of.

There is one very simple reason for all of this. The game is fun. The
entire purpose of the game is to enjoy it. Neither player is going to do
anything that will win <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>now<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, because then the game is over. Where's the
fun in that? Either player may do absolutely anything, but there are
things that will not happen, because they aren't fun.

I seem to remember there is a rule to Calvinball: Calvin always looses :-)
