Thanks for the link! Based on the photo and the description of the
rules given, Teeko sounds like it could fall prey to computer
analysis. This, of course, would depend on knowing the exact
ruleset (or rulesets), but consider this simple analysis:

I call the first player Red and the 2nd player Black here.
The board is 5x5, and any position would have k red tokens
and either k or k-1 black tokens, where k = 0,1,2,3, or 4.
(Of course there cannot be 0 red and -1 black tokens.)
If a position is defined by the arrangement of all the pieces
plus whose move it is, there are 174,438,376 positions.
Actually there are less than that, since positions where
both players have a teeko, or the player to move has a teeko,
cannot occur in a game.

A computer could scan and label all positions as follows:
On the first scan, all positions with a teeko are labeled as
wins. Then on the next scan, all positions where the player to
move can make a teeko, are labeled as wins for that player.
Then all positions where the player to move cannot avoid giving
the next player a win, are labeled as losses for that player.
On the next scan, all positions where the player can put the
opponent in a losing position are labeled as wins, and so on.
In the case of draws by repetition, there may be rules which
prohibit one side from making a move that repeats a previous
position under certain circumstances. The number of repeats
is irrelevant to the analysis of that position; just tell the
computer to avoid all such prohibited moves. In other words,
if a player is prohibited from repeating a position 3 times
or is prohibited from repeating once, the resulting analysis
of the game outcome would be the same. There may be some
positions which allow repetition. If all the moves from a
given position are labeled, and a drawn position can be reached
but a win cannot, then that node is labeled as a draw. So, every
node can be labeled this way, without any recursive tree search
needed. All that is needed, to solve Teeko this way, would be the
exact ruleset or rulesets used, and a computer with sufficient
memory to store all positions. The algorithm would need a way of
numbering each position. Just five possible tags are needed:
"Not labeled yet," "Red Win," "Draw," "Black win," and possibly
"illegal position." If the memory is available, perhaps the entire
game tree could be stored.

Actually, dealing with draw by repetition would be more complicated
than I describe, but I believe the algorithm is possible nonetheless.

So, who has the exact ruleset or rulesets for Teeko?
