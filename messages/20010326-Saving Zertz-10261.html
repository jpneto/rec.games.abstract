Zertz does play very differently with experienced players than with
beginners, but that shouldn't stop you from having fun!  As for
Panther's comment:

For experienced players Zertz will eventually only consist of an
opening and an endgame phase.

Zertz is a new game, and you can't expect to find Zertz players which are
really good. But imagine, the game would be played for a few hundred years
by some millions of people among them a few hundred Zertz professionals (this
is just an imaginary voyage). What would happen to the game?

Don't misunderstand me. I think that Zertz is a game with a big potential.
But I also think, that Zertz should be played with slightly different
rules on a much larger board. This would guarantee that Zertz would
remain as deep and "mysterious" as Go. Another comparison: Zertz is like
playing Go on a 9 x 9 board. If that would be the standard way to play Go,
it would be a shame.
