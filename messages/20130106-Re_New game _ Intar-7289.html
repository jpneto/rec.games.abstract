Abouricha, your style of design is "HI GUYS!  WHAT ABOUT HEX TURNED SIDEWAYS!  AMAZING!"



No, it's not amazing, Abouricha.  It's stupid.  There's no conspiracy.  It's just that everyone but you can plainly see that you're a no talent loudmouth.

First you know nothing about me.
Second I do not care about game designing because I innovate in lot of fields.
Third I know for my intellectual background that designing a game need lot of time : playtesting playtesting playtesting. At the end of the road the game will in fact be built by THE PLAYERS.
Hey Marcrappy instead of creating bad games (100 per year) take your time and create a really new game (entirely original) once a year.
You could sell it and make money. Then when you will enough money to live decently then you can release a game every second.

Now I have to say Good Bye Markrappy.
