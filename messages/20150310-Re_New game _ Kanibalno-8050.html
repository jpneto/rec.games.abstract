There is a wate of time anytime you play :
- against an opponent too weak except if the goal to help him to improve his skills. I will enjoy if he or she enjoys. 
- a game in which more complexity add nothing to the gameplay except more burning brain for nothing. Instead of playing chess 4D (if Joyjoyce knows what is really 4D and what 4D means and implies) I prefer to play a game I never played before. What am I going to learn if I play chess 3D or 4D? nothing! 
- a game where what you will learn at the end of the gameplay does not worth your try. I will not play an abstract game easy to solve by an average human. You know the solution before even making the first move.

An abstract game has to be deep. What I mean by deep it that each you replay you discover something new (new way of moving new strategy new tactics and so on). As an example I play Cephalopod long time ago and my feelings were that this is easy to master. I decided not to replay it.
If you want a proof to that go to any site play on line you will observe that the winners are always the same guys (2 or 3).

Grin, let's start with reading comprehension, Meh. Apparently you have a slight problem with it. But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and pretend that your only intent was to insult me rather than anything else. What do you consider to be 4D, Meh? I did give specific examples. Apparently you did not read them, did not understand them, simple as they were, or did not credit them. Nor did you credit the editor of Variant Chess, who was also the head of the British Chess Variants society, since he clearly stated my design was 4D. So I challenge you to define what 4D is, correctly. ;)

Next, the purpose of play is for enjoyment, entertainment. If someone learns a little something from a game, that's a plus, but it is not necessary. Most people like totally mindless games, like Monopoly or Chutes and Ladders.. What I learned from those games, before I was 10, was that I don't like games totally or heavily based on luck. That's one of the reasons I enjoy high-end abstracts, and designed so many. And since this site seems to be partially devoted to gratuitous insults, let me finish this paragraph with one: it's not my fault you are apparently unsuited to play high-end abstracts. :)

And let me wrap up this post with a question about the actual purposes of this site. Is this actually a site where people are invited and encouraged to discuss abstracts, or is it strictly a site for the self-aggrandizement of a few, primarily by insulting others?
