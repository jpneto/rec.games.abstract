Hi

Well it's been 4 years since I first posted on rec.games.abstract about 
Pacru, and so far my postings have been so dull they have brought forward no 
response (on the list) whatsoever.    There was (is) free software to try 
out the games, a very useful guide to pronunciation (that now appears to 
rate top in Google if you are looking for South London pronunciation ...), 
downloadable PDF rules in multiple languages, notification of world 
championships, even challenging statements about how unique Pacru is ... 
which surely I though would get a reaction.    Well in a fit of despair or 
madness I've put it all in the hands of a young video maker and now present 
the first (there is another but the author of that had problems with musical 
rights) Pacru video.  You may refuse to play or comment on the games, but 
can you really resist watching a video (and it isn't a simple video showing 
2 people playing a game .. oh no).   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pacru.com/video.html">http://www.pacru.com/video.html</a> 
"Enjoy" as they say ...  And I thought Abstract Games were a serious matter.

Cheers

Mike

BTW reports on the World Championships of Pacru (5th) Azacru (2nd) and 
Shacru(1st) held at the Mind Sports Olympiad in 2007 are now on the Pacru 
site.  Pentamind winner David M Pearce won the Shacru &amp; Pentamind runner-up 
Alain Dekker was successful at Pacru again and Martyn Hamer took the Azacru 
title.

2nd US competitions will be at U-CON in Ann Arbor in November.
