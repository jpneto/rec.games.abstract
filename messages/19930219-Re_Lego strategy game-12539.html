And (no slam intended) it would probably be a lousy game.  A few people can
create interesting games.  Most people will create terrible games if they
ever tried.  That's why some people are game designers and the rest of us
buy their games to play.

It disturbs me that everyone here slams people who like to build sets
following some sort of instructions (except Technics sets of course, THOSE
are OK for some reason).  Legos can be used for many purposes other than
what YOU (high and mighty though you are of course) think that they are
intended for.  Some people might like to put models together and for them
using Legos is just another form of model building.

So there.  Nyah!!  "Lego and imagination is what it is all about."  I think
I will be ill if I see that statement again.  Legos are for whatever you
want to use them for.
