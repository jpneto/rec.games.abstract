This is a game for any plural number of players.

First, draw a (2n)-by-(2n) array of dots (where the dots correspond to
the vertices of a grid of (2n-1)-by-(2n-1) squares), where 2n is at
least 6, I suggest.

Players take turns drawing a rectangle each move, each rectangle using
4 of the dots as corners. Each rectangle must have a unique area and
have unique corners (see below).

The sides of the rectangles may overlap those of previously drawn
rectangles, but no corner should be the corner of a previously drawn
rectangle (drawn by any player).
After drawing a rectangle, mark the 4 dots which are its corners with
x's so that it is known which dots have been used already.

Also, after drawing a rectangle, write down in a (growing) list the
area of this triangle (the area in terms of the "squares" of the
original array of dots).
No rectangle may have the same area as any previously drawn rectangle
(drawn by any player).

The last player able to successfully draw a rectangle using 4
previously-unused corners and having a unique area is the winner.
In other words, the player wins who moved just before the first player
who THINKS he or she cannot move.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
