TEIME

by Luis Bolaños Mures

Teime is a new connection game which is played on a regular hexagonal
board with 10 cells per side.

The game starts on an empty board. Each player has stones of his
allocated color: white or black. In their turn, starting with plack,
players put one stone on a vacant cell.

The game is won by the player who creates a "teime". A "teime" is a
closed connection of like-colored stones among three board sides of
which at least one is not adjacent to the other two. Corners are
considered to belong to the sides they touch. Please note that any
closed connection of like-colored stones among more than three sides
is always a teime.

Since the first player has a distinct advantage, the pie rule is used.

Draws are not possible in Teime. Also, as in Hex, any random filling
of the board always produces one, and only one, winner. In fact, my
objective with Teime was to create a game which corrected Hex's few
faults, which are IMHO the irregular board and the fact that the sides
every player has to connect are fixed from the start.

I am pretty sure of Teime's drawlessness, but I cannot find the way to
formally prove it. I will thank you if you help me on this point.

Enjoy!
