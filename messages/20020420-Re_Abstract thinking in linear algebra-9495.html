This is extremely helpful to me.  I'm glad I "vented."  The following
two comments especially help me see what my goals should be as I learn
more and more engineering.  

I tend to favor the proof-lecturers when I choose a professor.  But
I'd like to go from proof to manipulation, to proof, in a continuous
loop.  I find it hard to learn either one in the absence of the other.
When I was a high schooler, I would write "proofs" of my algebra
problems ("by the Distributive Law"...).  I wasn't taught that way,
but I was always interested in why I was "allowed" to do this or that
manipulation.  I was fascinated by the process of writing a string of
true statements that all depend on each other.  This kind of learning
style takes a lot of time, and I'm lucky if I get through even 1/2 of
the problems (hw).  But I also tend to go for the hard ones.  They're
more fun anyway.  

Everyone's comments helped in big or little ways.  I appreciate them.

This even applies to engineering students.  It is more
important that an engineer know what a differential equation
means and can use this to translate a real-world problem into
such, without knowing how to solve it, than putting down an
equation he knows how to solve, but which is not correct.

Yes, I think it's  hardest to state a problem correctly <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> in a way
that can be solved.

It isn't just engineers.  Think of all the mathematical physics which came
about from the false assumption that most physical phenomena are governed by
linear second order partial differential equations!
