In the rules to Yinsh it says the white player begins placing his rings
first, then the black player, alternating, until they've placed five. After
both have place their rings the rules (section D) say "you have determined
the starting position."

Then the rules continue on concerning how to move. But I never could find
who makes the first move after both players have placed their five rings. I
assume its the white player, but I'd like confirmation. Could someone
specify the rule that answers this? I would have thought the logical place
would have been in sections C or D.

I looked on the Gipf website for a Yinsh FAQ but didn't see one (nor one on
any other Gipf series game).  Here's the Yinsh section
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gipf.com/yinsh/index.html">http://www.gipf.com/yinsh/index.html</a> the rules are there if you click the
Rules button.  I also checked the Yinsh entry on BoardgameGeek, but saw
nothing that answered my question. I couldn't think of anywhere else to
look.
