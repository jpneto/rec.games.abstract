Why does it seem that nobody has ever published any result on the game
value of (contract or auction) bridge?  What is the difficulty?  I am
a stranger to game theory and would like to know if anyone has found a
winning strategy on bridge.

As far as I know, bridge has not yet been defined in terms of who will
win and who will lose when the cards are dealt. There are a number of 
computer programs on the market now, but many of them simply do not 
perform to the level of true top-flight experts.

The reason for this is not as much as the probabilities are too difficult
to compute, but rather because bridge is as much a game of probability 
as it is a game of psychology. 

Many times, making the "best" bid depends on what time your partner or
your opponents got up in the morning, or whether one of them is having
marital problems. No computer algorithm could possibly solve for this.
If affects players of all levels; not as much as the level increases, but
it is still there. In fact, many experts of today believe that world
championships are decided more on psychology than on mathematical ability.

So in answer to your question, I would say that in no way has bridge been
'solved', and it is a most enriching and invigorating game to persue. It
doesn't take much to learn the basic ideas, no more than a few hours, but
it takes many years of learning to become the 'perfect' player. Every time
you master a new concept, it opens doors to new questions you had never
thought of. 

I have played bridge for many years, and many of my peers tell me that
I actually have a good idea of what I am doing. But I still know that I 
have a lot to learn, and that will come in the next few years.
