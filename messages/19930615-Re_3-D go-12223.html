Try them, they aren't going to make you commit seppuku or anything you

Lots of people, but it's hard to get anywhere. Reasons follow.

We speculated a 7-7-7 cube, which would approximate the surface area of

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Here's the first big problem: a single stone can have up to six
liberties, compared with four. Two connected stones have ten liberties,
instead of six. So every time you add a stone to a line and your
opponent forms his own wall alongside, you get three extra liberties,
instead of the one you get in two-dimensional go. Imagine how easy it
would be to dodge in go if you could run away straight up or straight
down. This makes encircling groups, and hence territory, very much
harder. Hard enough it probably isn't interesting. In a way it's a
similar problem to the one Conway faced when he invented life. Make it
too easy or too hard for things to survive and grow and it becomes
uninteresting.

One solution would be to play, not on a cubic lattice, but on some
lattice with a coordination number of four rather than six (i.e. four
liberties for a single stone not on the edge). That would probably fix
the problem locally but not globally, since you still have to encircle
something over four pi sterradians instead of two pi radians. I tried
analysing go on a diamond-like lattice once, got as far as "ladders
don't work" after a lot of effort and decided it was too hard to
visualise to be playable. Maybe with some very good graphics software it
would be a different story.

We also speculated chinese rather than japanese rules, since territory
could be problematic.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you can't decide what's territory and what isn't you aren't going to
be able to get far regardless of what rule set you choose, but I think
the usual definition of territory, complete enclosure by living groups,
should work.

You need to be able to connect up all the groups enclosing the eye. In
go that means controlling four out of four sides and three out of four
corners. In 3D go I doubt the rules are so simple. There are six faces,
twelve edges and eight corners to every eye. I think you just have to
trace the connections.
