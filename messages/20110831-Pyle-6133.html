Here's a simple stacking game that came up tonight. I've called it
"Pyle".

Board 8x8 (10x10), 8 (10) white checkers, 8 (10) black checkers. Two
players.

Player One places all pieces on the board in such a way that every row
and every column contains exactly one white man and one black man.
Player Two next decides whether he wants to move first, in which case
Player One chooses color, or play with a particular color, in which
case Player One moves first.
Players in turn move one piece.

In the game black stacks and white stacks arise, but no mixed stacks.
Men and stacks are called pieces.
Pieces may never move over other pieces, regardless of color. Pieces
may not land on opposing pieces.
Pieces may land on pieces of like color, forming stacks.

Single men move diagonally.
Doubles move orthogonally.
Triples move both orthogonally and diagonally.
Pieces higher than three may not move.

Object: Be the first to make a stack of 8.

If both players end up with two stacks of 4 the game is a draw ;) .

Three others of my games employ this opening protocol, that allows a
player to carefully study both sides of an initial position before
presenting his opponent with it, Swish, Squeeze and InSight.
