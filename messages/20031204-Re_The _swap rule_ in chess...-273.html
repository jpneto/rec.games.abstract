<br>I guess it depends on what you mean by "trap." It seems you regard a trap
<br>as something high level players don't use between themselves. My latest
<br>issue of New in Chess (2003 nr. 6) features an exciting game between
<br>Viswanathan Anand and Viktor Bologan. Anand sprang an opening novelty which
<br>he had prepared last year, which led to his victory over Bologan. I would
<br>call that novelty a high-level trap. You can call it whatever you like.

<br>I think there's a difference between the typical opening trap (a 
tactical shot that's a standard part of the opening that might be missed 
by someone not familiar with the opening) and a theoretical novelty, 
that is, a well-prepared new line of an opening (for which the person 
playing it has studied well but which the opponent must work out over 
the board).
<br>
<br>I think that the former (traps) are rarely fallen for in GM games, while 
the letter (theoretical novelties) can be a big part of GM chess. I'd 
prefer to think of those as separate things.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Funny, coz to me it seems like you just explained how they are the same.
<br>
<br>The novelty is a standard part of an opening that the other person is 
not familiar with. Hey, that was your definition of a trap.
<br>And also, after it's worked once for a GM, it is the X-version of the Y 
opening, and shall be studied by all.
