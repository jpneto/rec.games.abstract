Games with Pentacubes:                                     22.12.92
======================
These are games described by Ekkehard K"unzell in his Book:
-- Spiele mit Pentakuben - 4th Ed. (available from the author).
  Ekkehard K"unzell,
  PENTAKUBENSPIELE, Schoenrathstr. 79, D-5100 Aachen, Germany
  Tel.: +49-241-58881

1) RESERVAT
   Two players select 12 pentacubes each.
   Then they are placed into a 8*8*2 box.
   The player, who can't fit a tile has lost.
   The winner get as much points, as the loser
   has left. If the winner can place some more
   pentacubes he get one point for each tile
   he can place.
   - tiles must be put parallel to the axis of
     the box. It is allowed to push them into
     holes in the bottom layer.
   - each tile must be placed, that they stand stable.
   (There exists a description of the game in english.
   It is a note, which the author distributed at his
   talk a the computer-game-olympiad 1991 in Mastricht.)

2) Husch-Husch ins K"orbchen
   The same as Reservat without the selection-phase and points.

3) Pentakubino
   Two players select 12 pentacubes each.
   like domino you build a chain of pentacubes. Two pentacubes
   can placed adjacend if they are 'similar'.

4) Pentakubennim
   The game-master, who knows the all numbers of the pentacubes,
   selects one tile. The other players look at the remaining 28.
   Who first says the number of the missing pentacube get a point.
   If you say a wrong number, the first player who finds this
   pentacube gets a point. ...

5) Pentakubenpatience
   Select 25 pentacubes. Then try to arange them into a circle,
   with similar pentacubes adjacent.

6) Fit In
   Place the pentacubes into the 8*8*2 box. You get minus-points if
   you can't touch the last plased pentacube or if you make death space.

7) Pentakuben-Nim
   A real nim-game. Two players get pentacubes. At your move, you can
   get one pentacube and as much similar pentacubes as you like.
   Who selects the last one wins. Or in the misere-game, who
   selects the last one loses.

8) Einr"aumspiel
   Try to fit the 29 pentacubes as fast as possible into a 8*8*3 box.
