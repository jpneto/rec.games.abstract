Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I agree that my Teeko program doesn't prove anything. :-)
But maybe I should look into re-writing my newer analysis
programs for Dao/Neutreeko and see if Teeko is within reach.
Do you have a complete list of the tournament game rules?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Advanced Teeko as explained in "Scarne on Teeko" had 16 different styles
of play, each one with slightly different rules. The idea was that
the game should remain varied enough (in regard to openings) that nobody
would ever master them all. It would take me hours to explain these
styles.

However, two special rules common to all advanced Teeko play are worth
mentioning:

4-move limit: If one player moves with one piece back and forth the same
two circles all the time, he must move during the next 4 moves another
stone or one of these two stones to another circle if his opponent asks
for it -- otherwise he looses.

10-move limit: If one player blockades his opponent's stones in one corner
and moves another stone all the time, his opponent can ask for a 10-move
limit. Then he must move another stone duing the next 10 moves or he
looses the game.

Teeko later developped into Scar-ney, when the pieces were marked with
numbers. I think the rules of Teeko remained, but the point scoring now
depends on the position of numerical pieces in the general winning position.

However, I don't know the exact point scoring of Scar-ney.

Ralf
