Here is a game for two players.

Needed, an n-by n grid drawn lightly on a piece of paper. Two pens or
pencils of different colors.
(I suggest n be at least 6.)

In this game, line segments are each drawn from some vertex of the
grid (along the lightly drawn grid line) to an adjacent (immediately
above, right of, below, left of) vertex.

On the first move, the first player draws a line segment with one of
the pens from any vertex to any adjacent vertex.
Then the other player draws a line segment with the other pen from
where the first line segment started to any adjacent vertex, as long
as the two line segments aren't drawn to (end at) the same vertex.

Thereafter, both players on each of their moves may draw a line
segment of EITHER color from the vertex last drawn to by a line
segment of that color. The line segment is drawn to any vertex such
that no line-segments coincide (except perhaps at a single point). So,
players may choose which end of the growing 'line' (a collection of
line segments placed end to end) to extend with a line segment on each
of their moves, provided that the color of any new segment matches the
segment it is attached to.

The line may pass through itself (the colors of the segments at the
intersection not mattering). (Example: Two older consecutive vertical
segments are conjoined at a vertex. Then later on, a newer line
segment comes from the left and meets at that vertex, then the lastly
drawn of these four segments proceeds from the vertex rightward.)

The line may also "bounce" off of a corner, making a new corner (again
the colors of the segments not mattering). (Example: An older segment
proceeds upwardly to a vertex, then the next older segment proceeds to
the right. Then later on, a newer segment comes from the left to meet
at that vertex, and finally the last segment is drawn upwardly from
that vertex.)

Continue the game until one of the ends of the total line cannot be
drawn anymore. (This will be either at the edge of the grid or perhaps
if, not necessarily when, the two ends of the line meet.)

The winner of the game has the most line segments of the color he drew
his first segment in.


Thanks,
Leroy Quet
