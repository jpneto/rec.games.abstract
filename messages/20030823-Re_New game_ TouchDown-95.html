Michael, I will keep your post below for context.  If you design a
game like this, in the future, consider posting to rec.games.design
and rec.games.abstract, as this game fits there.

Secondly, consider adapting it to Zillions:

Your title looks like Aarima light actually, with chess movement for
the pawn pieces.  I can see the potential for the game ending in
draws.

Hi Friends,

I've invented the game of "TouchDown" and would like your opinion on playing
stragey, etc.


Rules:

The game is played on a board with 4 rows and 8 coloumns like this (view
using a fixed-width font):

OOOOOOOO
........
........
XXXXXXXX

The pieces move like pawns in chess, i.e. move forward one square at a time,
but capture diagonally.

The winner is the first player to reach the opposite side of the board with
a pawn.

It is obligatory to move if possible. If a player has no more moves, the
game is a draw (a tie).

Variations:

The number of columns may be increased and/or decreased as one pleases.

Notation:

The notation is similar to chess, where the columns are named "a...h" and
the rows are numbered 1 through 4. The top right corner is thus named h4.

Strategy:

There is a good deal of "Zug Zwang" in this game, just like in chess. In
other words, one quickly reaches a position, where the player to move is
forced to give up the defensive position, and hence loses.

Consider the following sample game on a 4x4 board:
b1-b2  b4-b3
c1-c2  c4-c3
b2xc3  d4xc3
c2xb3  a4xb3

Now the following position is reached (with X to move):
....
.OO.
....
X..X

and no matter which "X" the first player moves, he is lost.

Consider the second sample game:
a1-a2  a4-a3
b1-b2  d4-d3
d1-d2

Now we've reached the following position (with O to move):
.OO.
O..O
XX.X
..X.

No matter what, O will now lose the game. In this position, if X were to
move first, then O would win. So being the player to move may be a
disadvantage for both players.

Third example, this time on a 6x4 board. After the following two moves

e1-e2  e4-e3

the following position is reached:

OOOO.O
....O.
....X.
XXXX.X

The first player now has one (and only one!) winning move. The correct move
is a1-a2. This I've determined by conducting a brute force search of all
move sequences on a computer.

What I would like now is somehow to be able to grasp the intuitive nature of
this game. Certainly, the fact that a1-a2 is the only winning move is not
logical or intuitive to me. (Yes, I've verified the output of the program by
hand, so I believe it, but I still don't understand it.)

I would also like to be able to make some heuristics in order to avoid
having to do a complete brute force search on the computer.

Also, how to generalize these ideas so they become independent on the size
of the board.

Any ideas, suggestions, or comments are welcome.

Regards,
Michael.
