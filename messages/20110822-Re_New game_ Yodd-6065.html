Isn't it curious how thin the line between connection and territory
games can be? I dare state the obvious: the more (potentially or
explicitly) numerous the entities you must connect (stones, groups,
edge cells...), the more your game leans towards the territory side.

I'm carefull with generalizations because I strongly lean to them, but
I can see how you would arrive at that conclusion. From my own
experience Havannah (3 'entities') comes to mind, with a clear
territorial component in its strategy.

ps. Did you consider a square version? Might be interesting with the

I haven't considered it yet. I think it works in Symple because
multiple placements compensate for the limited connectivity. In Yodd,
I'd say blocking would be too easy, but who knows?

On a square grid, if two pairs of groups, one of each color, are
competing for connection around the same area, it's likely that none
of them will succeed, whereas on a hex grid one side will always do,
at the expense of the other. The latter should be best for Yodd. What
do you think?

I have hardly any experience with Symple, and none with the
hexversion, but I feel the square version is superior because it
supports tactics that are not present on the hexgrid. And Symple as a
mechanism isn't loaded with tactics.

I feel a square version will introduce similar tactics in Yodd. I'm
not sure the 'local draw' component you mention is such a problem
because the game itself is decisive. I'd suggest you take a good look
at it. It will be a different game, that's for sure, but I feel it may
at least be equally interesting.
