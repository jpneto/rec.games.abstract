Hello, 

	A few friends and I are planning on both an X-Windows and Microsoft 
Windows version of abalone. I have played abalone for quite a while now, but 
all the information that anyone in this newsgroup might have, concerning 
tournament rules, other sources of possible information, 
longterm, shortterm or any kind of strategy at all, would be appreciated.
I, too find that Abalone gets really slow if both players play defensively,
and haven't quite figured out how to avoid that. If there are other people who
tried to make a computer version before, I'd like to  hear how you folks did
it, and I'm (We are) willing to share all kinds of deep thoughts, insights or 
frustrations...

	Thanks a lot in advance. 

Enno Rehling.
