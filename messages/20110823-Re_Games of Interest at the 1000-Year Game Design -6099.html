There's also a rather traditional looking abstract named Push:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/thousand-year-game-design">http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/thousand-year-game-design</a>...
I'm not so taken by a YouTube presentation though.

Yes, there were several abstracts I didn't include, including one on a
Go board that I thought you might be interested in.

Anyone want to wager a guess about which games will win?  I fear "our"
kind of games don't have a chance. One of the 2 judges is female and
few women seem to enjoy perfect-info, geometrical abstracts.

My money is maybe on Librarium.
