Hi;

This is the first time I post on the group. I am looking for a game called
"load runner". I believe it is a very very old game (at lest as old as
APPLE IIe or IIc). Also has pc version.

I asked most of peopel around. But they either gave me the wrong one or just
know nothing about it.  I tried to use Archie, but still fail.

The game basically talking about a little figure collecting some colored
boxes(namly treasures), And serveral( normally 3) chasers are trying to catch
that little figure. That little man can dig holes to trap those chasers. ( some
time dose that in order to get some treasures embedded by wall).  This game has
totally 50+ episodes.

That is all I remember. I miss that game so much. Please drop me a mail or post
if you know that game ( it most likely  has another name). or any clue about it.

Your attention will be  greatly appreciated.
