This sentence inspires me a little drawless game:

- A loop is defined as the smallest subset of a chain of stones which
surround at least one cell.
- Players take turns to place stones of their own color (Black or
White) on vacant cells.
- When a loop of stones of any color (Black, White or both) is formed,
the player with more stones in it wins. In case of a tie, the player
completing the loop loses.
- If a play forms two or more equivalent loops, only the one which is
most favorable to the moving player is counted (this is necessary on
square boards, but not on hex ones).

Neat idea! Except I foresee a problem: specifically, that you need to
place only four of your stones in a partial 6-stone loop in order to
ensure a win.  This is so easy to do that the game would either be a)
intensely tactical and entirely focused on such four-stone patterns;
or worse, b) a trivial win for whoever has the first stone on the
board, even with a pie rule.

thoughts?
