As O already has won two regions, X needs all the remaining ones. But since O
is ahead in total in the two regions bordering the West edge, X can't prevent
O from winning one of those as well and hence the game. Even if one of the two
X's in the East- South region was in one of the two critical ones instead, O
could still win by playing anywhere in those two until they were full.

True, O has won two regions.   But are you forgetting that you score for
rows and columns also?  It is conceivable that X could lose all five regions
and still win the game (at least, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it is conceivable).

There are 15 points in the game.  The score at present is 3-1 in favor of O,
with O having also won row 1, and X having won column 4.  X is far ahead in
row 5 and column 5, and could tie the game with her next move.
