I agree that card counting is a very important ability in Kahuna but I
disagree that it's "obvious" which islands your opponent can attack.
Since an island may be "attacked" using cards for "neighbouring"
islands it's much harder to know where you're vulnerable.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I agree with this general principle but it's rather meaningless in
practice. The only way to guarantee that you can not lose an island is
to control it and all adajcent islands. In order to control adjacent
islands you must control all islands that are adjacent to that one. In
effect you must control every island on the board.

Not true, if during the round you or your opponent uses the 2 Coco cards,
and the 2 Iffi cards, then you will know that if you take Kahu and only
leaves the two bridges to Coco and Iffi empty, then your opponent won't be
able to take Kahu from you (until after the discard pile have been shuffeled
again).

You don't even have to use the cards, just hold the cards on your hand, and
only use what's absolutely nessecary to take the island. If your opponent
then later removes one of your bridges, then you will be able to place the
card that you kept, and secure the island again. If you don't get to use the
card, then you will be sure that your opponent won't get it either.

And never-ever use cards to remove you opponents bridges, it's a waste of

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, I mostly agree with this but would not use the term
"never-ever". It's not unlikely that two adjacent islands are
controlled by a single player with a slim, one bridge majority on
each. If the other player has 3 of the 4 cards for a bridge linking
these two islands then by playing all three he can remove the critical
bridge, replace it with his own, take control of both islands and
remove all his opponents bridges. (Which is likely to cause the loss
of further islands.) A very efficient use of three cards. Now this
won't occur all that often as it's rare for a player to have 3 of the
4 cards necessary to pull it off but it's occurrence is greater than
"never-ever".

Not in my games, never-ever happens all the time :-)

And I would advocate using the first of the first of the two varian rules on
page 6.
