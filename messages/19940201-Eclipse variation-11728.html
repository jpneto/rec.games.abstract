Anyone else seen the game "Eclipse".  I found it in a local specialty
toy shop.  It is made in Indiana I believe.  The rules are very simple
and the game is much like Score Four but the goal is to get the most
3-in-a-rows.  The pegs are layed out so there are more posibilities for
scoring.  The top down view looks like:

   O       O
       O
   O       O
       O
   O       O

A variation I invented and played a couple times is that in addition
to straight 3-in-a-row scores (either on the same level, in a column,
or diagonally), 3-in-a-triangle scores are possible, either at the
same level or spiraling up.  This makes the game a bit more complex
and interesting.

There is another game in this class of games (What is this class
called?), the name of which I forget - some kind of Egyptian theme.
This one is more like Penta.  It is played on a flat board with six
concentric circles which I cannot draw properly in ascii.  Each ring
has six places to play a piece, one on each of six radial axes.  The
goal is to get six in a row, either all in the same ring, all on one
axis, or spiralling down across rings and axes.  If you surround two
of your opponents pieces by two of yours, you take them, and make them
yours, like Othello.  I think you only have to three such pairs to
win.  Furthermore, if in switching the opponents pieces to your own,
that causes another capture, you can do that one too.  The cascading
effect can quickly lead to the end of game.  The variations allow wrap
around on the axes so they are essentially in a ring too.  I don't
recall if there was a variation that had wrapping on the spirals, but
that would make sense, though it would be more difficult to visualize.
