I've got a new one that I'm hopeful for.  A nice combination of
simplicity and novelty. It comes from a discussion I had with Bill
Taylor about the possibility of using negative feedback in games.  By
negative feedback, I mean: the closer you get to winning, the weaker
you get.  Yinsh is an example: the closer you get to winning, the
fewer rings you have to play with.  Beyond Yinsh, there are few
negative feedback games.  I set out to invent one, and I came up with
something that feels (so far) nice and elemental (and drawless).

pdf rules: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-ketchup">http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-ketchup</a>

The rules:
---2 players take turns laying stones on a hexhex5 board (a square
board with a similar number of cells would be probably suitable as
well).
---The goal is to have the largest connected group on the board when
the game ends (i.e. when the board is full or one player can't make a
legal move).
---The player who currently has the largest group can place only one
stone on the board on his turn, but the other player can play 2 (this
is the negative feedback).
---If you're placing 2 stones on your turn, and the first one you
places causes you to have the largest group on the board, you may not
place your 2nd stone.
---You may never place a stone such that, at the end of your turn,
each player's largest group is the same size.

The game isn't quite complete yet, because it's not clear whether the
leader and his opponent should play 1 and 2 stones, respectively, on
their turns, or 2 and 3 stones.  I'm going to test it much more before
finalizing, but I thought I'd submit it here for comment.  I'm hopeful
for it because it has unusual dynamics: even though it's an equal
goals game, you feel as though you're playing an asymmetrical game due
the gross differences in power between the two players at any moment.
