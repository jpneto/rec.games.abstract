Hello group,

I am hoping someone more versed in the mysteries of game theory might help
me out on an issue. For a given position in a given game, are there any
smooth ways to calculate which possible lines of play might have led to that
position?

Specifically, I need to do this to an early endgame position in awale (to
include in a piece of fiction). I have tried exploring the variation root by
hand, but given the nature of the game, it grows immensely big after a very
short time. So I am at a loss. Is there any software that does this kind of
thing, or articles conserning it?

While I'm at it: Is there a standard way of recording a game of awale?
Thanks for any help consering all (or some) of this.

Can't solve your specific problem. Would it be possible to satisfy
the requirements of the fiction with a game that was very similar?
I mean, something that was qualitatively similar rather than having
substatially identical game position. I don't know the specific game
you are talking about, so don't really know if this suggestion is
even basically sensible.

But consider, to pluck a game from the air, checkers. If the end
game you needed for your fiction was, say, one checer left each,
there's lots of ways to get to something with that. Maybe you 
could choose a game that had the requirements you needed for your
fiction, and was sufficiently similar but not identical.
