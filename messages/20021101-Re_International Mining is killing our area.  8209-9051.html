I need some help here.
I rarely take my feet off the cracker barrel so maybe my ignorance of
economics is showing but my guess as to what creates wealth is:
1 Mining
2 Manufacturing
3 Farming
All else makes those things move more effeciently. (Which does create
lots of wealth but that wealth is subsidiary and therefore depends on
the above three.)

E.g. Highways gets the goods to market faster or software allows more
efficiency in the many proceses that are required to get the stuff to
you, the consumer.
Having posted that, and if my cracker barrel economics is correct, the
original poster hasn't a clue as to what it takes for him? to survive.
Banning mining, manufacturing, farming in the poster's area would be a
good thing because if his/her/its hope is realized, he/she/it would
probably not survive the coming collapse.
Darwinism. YEAH!

Hunger does focus the mind.
