Back in the early 60's when I was a kid, it seemed almost every Christmas or
birthday somebody gave me a packet of marbles or jacks. I never knew what to
do with either. And as best as I can now recall, neither did my
friends/classmates/neighbors. When I'd ask an adult I'd get a vague one
sentence explanation. Respectively, "Use the shooter to hit the other
marbles" and  "Jacks?: you pick them up."  That was of no help. The
different types of marbles (cat eyes, the big shooters, etc.) were
interesting to look at, but after 5 minutes of that I was bored. And the
little red ball that came with the metal jacks always got lost. And someone
ended up stepping on a jack barefoot. (Ouch!). And of all the sets of each I
received, or sets others had, NO ONE ever had any rules. It was as if adults
thought children had some inbred knowledge of these games. Furnishing rules
seemed superfluous to them, I guess. So bags of marbles and jacks just
accumulated in a dark corner of the closet. Awaiting the next generation to
pull them out and ask, "What's this?"  Only to be answered with, "Marbles
and Jacks". Period. The cycle of ignorance continued.

Anyway, it was over 25 years later before I was enlightened on both games.
And when that occurred my reaction was, "how dull", even for a child (of the
60's).

I don't know, but I'm guessing these were holdovers toys from the Great
Depression. My parents and theirs peers grew up during that time. And I
suppose they bought these toys not because they were good, but because they
had them as children (when you were lucky to have anything). Why these
toys/games are still being sold in 2003 beats me.

When was the last time you saw anyone play marbles or jacks, by the rules?
Yes, they really have rules (that was one of the things I didn't know for
decades).
