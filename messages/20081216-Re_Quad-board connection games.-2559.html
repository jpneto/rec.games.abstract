It would be an intriguing game-design challemge (HELLO NICK!),
to design a game which was "clearly" a connection game "in spirit",
but had no grid at all!  I'm not sure how one could go about it
in view of the remarks above, but there seems no a priori problem.

How about this:

Each player has a number of circular disks of their colour and take
turns placing disks inside a large circle.  Disks can touch, but not
overlap.  Disks can be played so they overlap the perimeter of the
large circle, but the center of a disk must be inside the circle.  The
first player to connect two parts of the circle-edge that are more
than 100 degrees apart with a path of touching disks wins.

I can't say if this will ensure a winner on "filled" board (one where
no more disks can be played), but paths certainly can't overlap.

I found a potential flaw:

Both colours can make such paths without needing to cross.  They can't
do so at the same time, so it is not a critical flaw.  A fix is known
from similar hex-grid games: Connect three points on the circle such
that at most one of the three arc sections defined by these points is
less than 90 degrees.

It is now possible to "fill" the board without any winner: One player
makes a linear path slightly to one side of a diameter and the other
makes a similar path slightly to the other side, such that no disks
can be placed between these.

Some more thought is required, but I'm sure something like this could
be made to work.
