March 1 was the closing date for the stacking contest. I take it it's

As of yet there are 2 judges.  Declan and Dave.  We meet tomorrow to
talk and start with the games.  Today I need to print rules and start
making boards etc... If I find a suitable 3rd person there may be
three judges.  In the event that we don't finish by March 20th don't
bite my head off ; ).  I will be out of town for a few days of the
judging duration.

I would ideally like for D&amp;D just to play each other, but it will
probably be the case where i will also play the games with them since
getting them in the same place at the same time might not be so easy.
I'm definitely not a judge just to make that clear (like I'd want that
drama lol).

They will simply pick their favorites out of the bunch and we'll
announce a top 3.
