An interesting variation on the game is to start with the same
scenario but determine the winner in a different way. The two players
jointly generate a permutation of 1,2,...,2n. Declare player 1 the
winner if it is an odd permutation and player 2 the winner if it is
even.
I think that this game is fair given any deal with simply shuffling
your deck randomly an optimal mixed stratgey, but I haven't proved it
rigorously.

Should be, yes.  Either player can always flip the outcome of the game
by swapping any two of their own cards: thus this game is essentially
equivalent to the well known "matching pennies" game.

That is roughly what I was thinking. A variation of the game would be
to have the two players play a card of their choosing at each stage
(rather than sequence the cards in advance). In this case it is easy
to see that player 2 has a winning strategy since their second to last
play is the last play in which either player has any choice and one of
their two choices will result in an even permutation. Trivial as a
game, but proving that player 2 has a winning strategy might make for
an interesting homework problem in an introductory abstract algebra
course.
