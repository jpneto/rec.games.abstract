Game name : Survival

Goal : the winner is the one who at the end of the game has the biggest number of his tokens on the board

Board : Circular board with 16 sections or cases

Material 
96 tokens : 
6 sets of blue tokens numbered from 1 to 8 (6*8=48)
6 sets of red tokens numbered from 1 to 8 (6*8=48)

Rules 

Definition : a string of tokens is composed by at least 2 connected tokens of the same colour.

Choose who plays first
Players take their turns alternatively
Blue starts first
On his turn a player places his token on the board and if it is the case remove a string of his colour. 

Placement :
All the moves are made clockwise
A player chooses one of his token and place it as follows :
- the placement is based on the previous token played by his opponent.
- the player has to place it clockwise at the distance indicated the previous placement.
As example : if his opponent placed the token 6 he has to count 6 cases clockwise from his opponent token and drop his token.

Removing the string 

If a player land on his own token he has to remove it and remove ONLY all the string forward clockwise even if he lands on the middle of the string. All the tokens removed from the board are NOT reused. He can not remove a string of his opponent even if he lands on some token part of it. His turn ends.

      
The game continues until all the tokens are played.
So the players have a fixed number of turns. 

When the game ends the player who has the biggest number of his colour on the board win the game.
