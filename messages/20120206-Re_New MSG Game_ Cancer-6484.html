Red Stone
by Mark Steere

INTRODUCTION
Red Stone is a variant of Go in which red stones are used to capture.
The red stones are permanent and cannot themselves be captured.

The two players, Black and White, each have unlimited stones of their
own color.  They also share an unlimited supply of red stones.  Draws
cannot occur in Red Stone.   Mark Steere designed Red Stone in
February, 2012.

OBJECT
You must completely annihilate your opponent, emptying the board of
his color stones.

PLAY
Starting with Black, the two players take turns placing stones onto
unoccupied points on the board, subject to restrictions, one stone per
turn.  On his first turn, Black must place a black stone.  Likewise
for White.  On subsequent turns, players must place either a stone of
their own color or a red stone, subject to restrictions, but not
both.

GROUPS AND LIBERTIES
A group is an orthogonally (horizontally and vertically)
interconnected collection of like-colored stones.  Only black groups
and white groups will be discussed here, not red groups.

A black liberty is a vacant point orthogonally adjacent to a black
group.  Likewise for white liberties.

CAPTURES
A capturing placement deprives at least one group of its last
remaining liberty.  Such a placement must, and can only be, made with
a red stone.  Said red stone is permanent and cannot itself be
captured.

Groups of both players' colors can be captured by either player (by
placing a red stone).  I.e. suicides and suicide kills can happen.

When multiple groups are bounded (deprived of their last remaining
liberties) by a placement, all such groups are removed immediately
following the placement, regardless of the groups' colors.  If a
temporarily bounded group is unbounded by the removal of a
neighboring, enemy group, said temporarily bounded group is still
removed.

If your placement eliminates all enemy stones from the board, you
win.  If your placement eliminates all black and white stones from the
board, you win.  If your placement eliminates all of your own stones
while enemy stones remain on the board, you lose.

EYES
An eye is an isolated, unoccupied point (i.e. not adjacent to any
other unoccupied points) belonging either to Black or to White, but
not both.  If the isolated, unoccupied point is adjacent to at least
one black stone and no white stones, then said point is a black eye.
Likewise for white eyes.  An isolated, unoccupied point with at least
one black adjacency and at least one white adjacency is not an eye.

If an eye is not the last remaining liberty of its surrounding group,
then  the eye's owner may place a stone of his own color on it.  You
cannot place a stone of any color on an enemy eye which is not the
last remaining liberty of the surrounding, enemy group.

If an eye is the last remaining liberty of a group, then either player
may place a red stone on it, capturing (or self-capturing) the
surrounding group.

RED EYES
An isolated point with neither black nor white adjacencies, i.e. with
only red adjacencies, is a red eye.  Players are not allowed to place
a stone of any color on a red eye.

NO PASSING
Players are not allowed to pass if they have a placement available.
If a player has no placements available, he must sit the game out
until he does have a placement available.
