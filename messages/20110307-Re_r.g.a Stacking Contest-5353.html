I think a discussion about different approaches to inventing abstract
games would make an interesting thread. Mark and I differ in that I
care less about finitude and cyclophobia. Let's take Crossfire because
it has just been implemented at BoardSpace.net. Crossfire has cycles
covered by a simple ko-rule. It has no hard finitude, and may not even
have soft finitude (actually I don't know - it would depend on the
outcome of a 2 men versus 2 men endgame, my point being: who cares).
But it is an interesting game, more so than its parentgame Focus, and
it has yet to see its first draw.
So depending on one's point of view, everything is wrong with it, or
nothing.

Now Cyclix was particularly disturbing for Mark - I'm all those who
'love to make variants on MQ' - because it is actually <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>called<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
Cyclix.
It doesn't treat it a bug but as a feature! And it employs a mechanism
of MQ. How misguided can one get ;-) .

I'm fair enough to admit Mark's Queen inspired Cyclix, just as Mark
was fair enough to admit that Monkey Trap inspired MQ. So it's not all
that black and white, and neither game tries to copy the one that
inspired it.

The point that's really arguable is whether Mark's criteria are
superior or whether they actually pose a limit. Symple among others
could have been a Mark Steere game, so I'm well at home within his
framework and actually endorse it if an idea happens to head in that
particular direction. Crossfire, on the other hand, could not be a
Mark Steere game.
