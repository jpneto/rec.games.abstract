It seems the problem with Mark is that he doesn't satisfy all
the former criteria, the ones which would make an anti-social
attitude more forgivable, namely those about being well-
researched and giving attribution correctly.

I give credit where credit is due.  When I accidentally rediscovered
Hex, I removed it from my website and gave proper attribution.  When I
found out my M-Torus was similar to Bill's unobvious Projex, I removed
it from my website and created a stub (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/">http://www.marksteeregames.com/</a>
M-Torus_rules.pdf) attributing Projex to Bill Taylor.

Nobody owns the torus game.  It's just too damn obvious.  As I said in
my earlier post, a skilled researcher could undoubtedly find a number
of textual references to the underlying concepts, and the application
of those concepts to a game is overwhelmingly obvious.  If someone
wanted to implement the torus game with a weave pattern and call it
Herringbone Doughnut, they'd be well within their rights - no
attribution necessary.

Sure, his (re-)discoveries are interesting, but he really needs
work on the other components. (From my opinion, the thing he
needs to work most on is the 'proven' part, there are many
suggestions put forward, but none seem to be given more than
the most superficial testing to see whether they make sense at
all. I.e. I don't think he's ever actually played more than a
tiny fraction of his 'games'.)

I don't really need to do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>anything<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  It's not like I'm getting paid
for this.  For me the fun part is the design and, starting with
choosing a name and writing the rule sheet, it becomes work.  I have a
lot more successful, flaw free, re-discovery free games than not
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/index.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/index.html</a>).  Yes, there's a chance
any one of my new games will have a problem.  I make no secret of
that.  Pop a big grain of salt and proceed at your own risk.  Nobody's
forcing you.
