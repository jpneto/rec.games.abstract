Exactly what I thought.  Just wanted to make sure it wasn't Walter
Sandsquish, the founder of the original group, stacking-games.  Ralf, who
was an assistant moderator of the original group, vandalized the group and
started his own group, true-stacking-games.  Later, apparently realizing how
stupid that sounded, he changed it to stacking_games.

So... Ralf was trying to get you to disqualify Monkey Queen.  The astounding
thing is that you seemed to be buying into it with your post questioning
Monkey Queen's admissibility six weeks into the contest.  No offense,
Daniel, but that was so profoundly absurd that it's now no surprise that
Ralf Gering was behind it.

Ralf Gering, with his tenuous grasp of the English language, was the guy who
started this whole arbitrary stacking game definition idiocy years ago. 
It's amazing that people continue to buy into it.  According to Ralf Gering,
Mancala games are stacking games, lol  Need I say more?

A stack has at least number, plainly visible, and in the case of mixed color
stacks, order.  A big pile of uniformly colored stones has neither visibly
discernable number nor order.  A pile is not a stack.  Native English
speakers know that, yet they still buy into Ralf's inanity.  [shaking head]
I'm getting a pinched nerve from all the head shaking this group is causing
me.

lol, You don't know Ralf Gering very well.  The whole point of Ralf Gering
moderated forums is simply for Ralf Gering to have a reason to lord over
everyone.  If you fail to snap your boot heels in a timely manner, you're
out.
