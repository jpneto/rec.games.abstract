Not towards you, it's something I must conclude to in a general sense.
Since almost any new game already starts at 'great' we're short on
superlatives. I denied Symple the qualification 'great' because it
lacks drama. I must add that Symple is far more essential for the
'group penalty theme' than Ea Ea's *Star. Yet the inventor (previously
known as Craige Schensted) says about his game "*Star is what those
other games wanted to be". It's his "supergame".

Symple is far better structured, far more general (not connecting
specific cells), and introduces an opening mechanism for games based
on the growing of groups that has wider implications and applications
than can be found the game itself. It also has an integral balancing
mechanism. But Symple lacks drama because it lacks the right amount of
tactical leverage to turn the tables in a game that goes a certain
way. Of course *Star lacks drama too. Not that the inventor would
admit it.

So for the record: my judgement of games, including my own, doesn't
start at 'great', it ends at 'great'. Sygo is a great game, and the
only great game of the ten or twelve I found recently. In my case that
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>means<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> something.

Regarding an expert jury, yes I prefer that to a jury of contributers,
because I feel uncomfortable voting at all when I foresee reproaches
flying around whatever the outcome. Mark has pushed MQ as his greatest
game ever (to which I don't agree) and from his point of view there
can be but one possible outcome of the contest. Not contradicting MQ's
superiority is taken as agreement. Contradicting it will result in a
discussion of undetermined length. It's not an atmosphere in which I
feel comfortable to cast a vote.

Marks objections to a public vote go from the premiss that someone out
there actually gives one iota about what's going on here in terms of
'personal relations'. The general public are not 'monoric' and Bill
Taylor is a waning entity and certainly no reason to refrain from a
public vote in a future contest.

For this year, apart from John Mccallion and Robin King, there's also
Connie &amp; Kerry Handscomb who used to run Abstact Games Magazine.

Regarding Wayne and John and Robin: maybe a yearly event could be
sponsored by Games?
