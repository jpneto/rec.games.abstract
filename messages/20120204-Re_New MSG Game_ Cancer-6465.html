Cancerous eyes attune to the overall architecture of the game. When
you drop a cancer stone into an eye, you're killing a group of size

"So to speak". From the rules:
"If an eye is a group's last remaining liberty, only a cancer stone
can be use to fill it, killing the surrounding group."
So if an eye is the last liberty, a cancer stone kills an actual
group, otherwise it "kills a group of size zero". Don't forget to
remove it after capture, lol!

With that kind of 'sound architectural explanation' that might be a

The "group of size zero" stuff looks certainly forced. The real
architectural explanation, without the need to even mention eyes,
would be:

"After placing a stone of your color, if there are any groups without
liberties, they're removed, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the point where you placed your
stone becomes a cancer."

This includes the case of filling an eye which is not the last liberty
of a group. Of course, this is not the most practical rules wording,
but it's a sound conceptual explanation.

However, my suggested variant is equally sound:

"On your turn, you must place either a stone of your color or a cancer
stone. Cancer stones can only be placed if they cause the removal of
some group(s). Stones of your color can only be placed if they don't
cause any removal."

This precludes implicitly the placement of any kind of stone on an
opponent's eye which is not the last liberty of the surrounding group,
so no corner cases here, either. Note that, in this version, the
conceptual and practical wordings are the same ;-)

That's the way I would have put it, but maybe it's just a matter of
taste, and I don't want to interfere with someone else's game.
