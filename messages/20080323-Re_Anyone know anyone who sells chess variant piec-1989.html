Hey, anyone have a lead on this? I would like to get pieces of the
Capablanca chess variety (Knight-Rook, Knight-Bishop), but my search
on the web has come up empty. Anyone have any possible leads here on
this?

Capablanca pieces are used in Christian Freeling's chess variant
"Grand Chess," where they are called the Marshal and the Cardinal.  I
don't have a Grand Chess set myself, but I believe they are still sold
on Freeling's website.  The physical representation of the Capablanca
pieces is somewhat crude (horses with things growing out of their
heads), but Grand Chess as a chess variant is excellent --- the key is
the back row, which is empty except for the rooks, allowing for much
more freedom in setting up defense and attack.

Do you have a link to the specific purchase page?  I found his site:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index-mindsports.html">http://mindsports.nl/index-mindsports.html</a>

But I don't see a store on there.

Also I am in the United States.  I would like to be able to order them
and have lower cost shipping.  I would like to get them to experiment
with an 8x8 version of Freeling's game, and also a version of
Capablanca that uses gating to get the Cap pieces on the board.  In
addition, I have another one more standard I am working on, based on
the same gating concept to I would like to try out.  I might look to
also code it up in Zillions, but need to figure out how to do gating.
Fairly soon, I will be getting the IAGO Chess rules up on the variant
site.  I am doing final tweaks.

Rich,

Click on the box that says "Grand Chess Hex Dame Boards and Sets."
The sets are way out of my price range but they do look nice.

I would caution against an 8x8 variant of the game.  Freeling's 10x10
board greatly increases piece maneuverability and alleviates the
staleness that tends to haunt the opening in chess-type games.

What is "gating," by the way?  Is that some special method of entering
chess pieces onto the board?

Steve
