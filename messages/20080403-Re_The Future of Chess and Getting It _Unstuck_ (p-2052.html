This is a philosophical piece for the most part meant to give thought
to where things can head, and why.  I will acknowledge that this is
potentially heresy to those who live and die FIDE chess and consider
it handed down from the divine as some immutable set of rules that is
meant to last FOREVER.

I personally believe there is part of
the answer in a game like Seirawan Chess, or a pocket version with
reserves, but I don't think they alone have the answer.  It also
doesn't address the framework issue either that gets chess stuck, and
all the classic abstract strategy game (stuck here means set on a path
to being "solved", without a way to adjust before it does).

My take on Godel's Incompleteness Theorm is that you don't solve the
systemic issues with a certain set of rules by creating more rules of
the same type.  If it is show, for example with chess, that a set
configuration of chess pieces on the board eventually produces
something that is solved, then changing the configuration of the
pieces on the board alone doesn't resolve it either (one time,
fixed).  You can change the their starting position (aka Chess960/Pick
your Army/MetaChess or the V and X versions of IAGO Chess), the layout
of the board at start (and also changing it during play, aka Beyond
Chess), or when the pieces enter the game (IAGO/Seirawan/Pocket Knight/
Pocket Mutant), and help to push things out further.  If you build
into the framework by which you can do all of the above, you buy more
time.  What regular chess has now is not a way to make chess get
"unstuck", allowing it to adjust over time.

For one thing, most chess players are not worried about Chess getting
stuck. Yes, there is more and more opening theory to study, but that
means we are learning more and more about the implications of this one
set of rules, and obtaining better and better play.

To speak on the philosophical plane, to make a Chess that always moves
out of being unstuck in the way you seek means that it has to grow,
and grow, and get more complicated without limit. So after a Chess on
a 12 by 8 board with thousands of variations - one idea I proposed -
eventually gets solved, we have to switch to a 16 by 8 board or
something bigger, and then something bigger still. Until the
chessboard, even though the chessmen are so small we need tweezers to
pick them up, is to wide for the chessplayers' arms to reach, so they
have to walk to Kingside or Queenside to make their moves.

To get more practical, then, the problem isn't really Chess getting
'stuck' in the abstract mathematical Godel sense. That could not be
solved.

Part of the real percieved problem is that what is wanted is a contest
of tactical and strategic skill, not of memorizing opening variations.
This relates to your concept of Chess getting 'stuck', but it is more
practical and less theoretical.

The other part is that we want more games like that of Labourdonnais
versus Macdonnell and Anderssen versus Kieseritzky. Exciting
sacrifices, blazing tactical fireworks, not draws and defensive play.
But subtle positional play is not without beauty, but it is a bland
steady diet.

The solution to that? I have no idea. I am neither the first or last
to suggest giving partial credit for forcing stalemate to have fewer
draws, but I'm not sure if it will promote more tactical play or more
defensive play. Chess isn't like hockey or football, where a simple
subtle rule change - the equivalent of replacing the 50-move draw rule
with a 35-move draw rule - can change the balance between offence and
defence.
