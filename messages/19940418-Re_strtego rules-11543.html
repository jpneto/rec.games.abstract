All true according to the rules that came with my game.  Here they
are (almost verbatim, I corrected a few typos):

RULES OF THE GAME

STRATEGO is a game that will afford hours of entertainment and
excitement not only to the two players but also to the spectators.
The object of Stratego is: to capture the opponent's flag.
Each player gets an army of forty pieces, the ranking, emblems
and numbers of which can be seen on the game board.

These pieces have to be placed in such strategic formations as to
give the best possible chance of attack and defense.
Strategy -- the basis of many games, such as chess and checkers
-- is apt to raise thoughts of warfare.  However, the publishers have
had no intention to present a game of war; this particular form has
only been chosen because the military order of rank is so eminently
suited to assign a certain value to the different pieces.

ARRANGEMENT OF THE PIECES
First of all, the players draw lots to decide who will play with the
red pieces, since the red party may open the play. Next, the players
lay the playboard between them with the Stratego emblem towards
them, and place one piece in each square of their half of the board,
but in such a way that the back of the piece is towards the opponent,
so that the latter does not know the arrangement. In setting
up the pieces the two middle rows of squares must remain unoccupied
just as the two lakes which, also in the course of playing, the
armies may not cross. That the pieces will have to be set up
according to the player's own strategic insight, will be clear from
the rules of play.

RULES OF PLAY
In turn, the players may move one of the pieces to the extent of
one square, either forwards, backwards, to the left, or to the right.
Contrary to the other pieces the scout is allowed to jump more than
one open square in one move. He can then end up on a vacant
square, or on a piece of his opponent. The flag and bombs may NOT
be moved and so remain in their original position during the entire
game.

When two opponent pieces have approached one another -- the
pieces may now be standing facing each other or side by side -- the
player whose turn it will be may take up his piece and with it strike
the piece of his opponent, while at the same time declaring his
rank.

The opponent answers by naming the rank of his piece. If it is a
piece with a lower rank, then it is removed from the board and the
higher rank piece takes the place which has thus come free. If,
on the other hand, the opponents piece proves to have the higher
rank, then the lower ranking piece is removed from the board while
the higher ranking piece retains its own position. So the spy goes
down before the scout, the scouts go down before the miners, the
miners before the sergeants, the sergeants before the captains,
and so on. When equal ranks meet, both pieces drop out.

When two pieces stand next to each other, it is not necessary to
strike at once; the move to do so may come from either player.
Against a bomb, which may not be displaced, any piece, except a
miner, goes down. If one of the players strikes a bomb, the other
answers with BANG. Only the miners are capable of putting a bomb
out of action and at such an encounter the bomb is removed from
the board.

The flag, the other piece that must not be moved, falls at the
attack of any other of the opponent's pieces.
The marshal, the highest in rank, only falls for the spy, if he is
attacked by the latter. Nut, if the marshal is the attacker, the spy
goes down.

If the player has no movable piece left, for instance only flag and
bombs, he has to capitulate to his adversary.
No piece may be shifted more than 5 times back and forth in the same
2 squares. The player who captures his opponent's flag is winner of
the game.

TACTICS
 From the above it will be clear that the position of the pieces can
determine the outcome. It is, therefore, good defensive tactics to
surround the flag by a few bombs. However, in order to mislead the
opponent, it is also recommendable to place a few bombs at some
distance from the flag. A high-ranking piece here and there in the
front lines is a good thing, but the player who loses his high
officers stands in a weak position.
Scouts in the front lines are useful to probe the strength of the
opposing army, but a player who has lost his scouts, is obliged to
play at random.

(it would be nice to have the rules of other popular board games on file
as well... wink wink, nudge nudge. I would be especially interested in
the rules for A&amp;A.)

Cheers,
Caspar.
