I don't mind the thought of adding a new variant of Chess to help to
address certain perceived problems; if Capablanca, Fischer, Seirawan,
and the Polgar sisters have all been involved with variants, they're
not entirely a bad idea. But they're no panacea - especially for the
issue of the popularity of Chess.

I googled Polgar sisters variants in google and your post here comes
up in the top 10.  Go figure.  Anyone know what variants the Polgars
play?

Googling (Polgar chess variant) produces some more viable-looking
results.  IOW, the answer may be different for each sister (actually
the first hit explains some variants suggested by their father).

Football, the game itself, is
FAR more complicated than chess.  It is compared to chess, because
chess is a simplistic analogy to have people relate to it.  It has
multiple ways you can score in it, a bunch of rules governing how the
pieces on the board can move, more than chess.  It also has multiple
phases, unlike chess.  Yes, football is on TV.  It is because the NFL
made it TV friendly back then.  Had it not done that, it wouldn't be
where it is today.  It would be even less than hockey is.  I believe
that it wouldn't even be necessary to change the basic time controls
either.  Sure, change the scoring a bit, so you get closure, but for
TV, you can do time compression.

Speaking as an amateur follower of both games, football is easier to
partially understand, because more aspects of it follow simple linear
scales that routinely vary widely:

  1) Which team is behind on points?  By how many?  How much time do
     they have left to try to catch up?

  2) Which team has possession, i.e. is in a short-term position to
     score more points?  How close are they to a scoring position,
     i.e. where is the line of scrimmage, what down is it, and how
     far must they advance the ball to reset to first down?

  3) What are each team's specific strengths and weaknesses?  What
     strategies do these dictate?  (This is where it gets complex.)

The closest obvious analogy in chess is "which player is behind on
captured pieces?".  Beyond that, what would a similar breakdown of
positional analysis look like?
