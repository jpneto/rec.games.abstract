There's probably some discussion of exactly what this group is supposed
to contain in groups like rec.games.go, rec.games.chess and so on. I'm
sure I remember seeing something of the sort a month ago or thereabouts.

Anyway, if my recollection of what was said is correct, this group is
intended for discussion of games which are "abstract" in the sense that
they don't represent anything in the real world, and that they don't
depend in a fundamental way on any real objects; thus chess, go and
tic-tac-toe are abstract games, but Diplomacy and football are not.
(Diplomacy is of course much closer than football.)

Conventionally, use of the fingers as a memory aid is frowned upon.
For the advanced player, 3-D tic-tac-toe is an option, using a 3x3x3
cube with the same rules.  4-D tic-tac-toe has been invented, but
never played. It is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>truly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> abstract game (-:

four-d tic-tac-toe has been played, although it wouldn't be too much
fun trying to do it blindfold as suggested by the poster just quoted
for the two-d version.

Actually, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe is an easy first-player win,
with the following strategy:
  1. Play your first move in the centre.
  2. There are three 3x3 "planes" through the centre; your opponent's
     first move cannot lie on all of them.
  3. So, make your next move in a corner of that "plane".
  4. This threatens an immediate win, so your opponent must counter it.
  5. Now you win in the obvious way on that "plane", unless your
     opponent's moves so far threaten an instant win for him.
  6. For this to be the case, his first move must lie on one of the
     three "planes" which contain his (forced) second move.
  7. But remember that you had a lot of choice as to what your second
     move was, and that when you exercised that choice you knew about
     his first move. All you have to do is to pick a "corner" (not a
     corner of the cube, note) whose "opposite corner" isn't on any of
     the same "planes" as your opponent's first move. This is easy,
     since that first move cannot exclude all of them.

Incidentally, the above was done blindfold, without counting on fingers
or drawing pictures. Therefore 3-d tic-tac-toe can be played blindfold.
I wouldn't fancy doing so if I were the second player, though.

Errm, a corresponding argument proves that 4-d (or higher) tic-tac-toe
is a win for the first player too. But I wouldn't like to have to play
it blindfold if we had to number the spaces 1-81; I'd get too confused.
In fact, I think I'd get too confused however we numbered the spaces.
