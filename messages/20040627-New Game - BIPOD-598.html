Hi All.  For some while, Joao Neto and I have been playing a new game,
which we have now refined into more or less final form,
and it seems quite a good one.

It is part of a general area of games which we dub "adoption games".
These are inspired by Unlur - they are games in which two sides have
unequal tasks, possibly quite substantially so.    Each player plays
a move alternately, all for the weaker side.  At any time, if either
player feels it has gone far enough, he calls "adopt", rather than
place another move, signifying he now thinks the weaker side has
enough on the board to allow him to win.  The other player then
plays the first move in the remaining regular-alternation game,
taking the (originally) stronger side.

There is a huge build-up of tension in the first part of the game, as
in Unlur, as both sides attempt to get as close to equality as possible;
what I call the "playing chicken" part of the game.

Anyway, that's adoption games in general.


This particular one, which we call "Bipod", was originally an offshoot of
Cam Browne's Antipod, but now much trimmed down, to highlight the essential
distinguishing feature of this game.  That feature is, that the stronger
side has TWO starting points, and must form chains from BOTH of them to
the edge, and OC the chains cannot overlap or intersect - so his two
paths tend to interfere with each other - that is the new idea here.

As always the board size is variable, but we are currently playing
quite a good game on the size below.   I expect eventually it will
have to become somewhat bigger.  One thing we have noticed is that
it gives quite good practice at "Hex" techniques, without having
the worry of the Hex global strategy.


BIPOD
=====
It is played on a trapezium-shaped hex board, with two cells on the long
side occupied by different coloured pieces, so that the colour-colour
and colour-corner empty-cell numbers are equal.

The two players alternate in placing a single(*) blocking stone in
any empty cell.  Cells that have been cut off from continuous empty-cell
connection to both starting pieces, may not be played.

On any turn, a player may elect instead to "adopt" the running option.
The other player then becomes the Blocker, and continues playing
single blocks on each turn.   The Runner now plays single stones
of whichever starting colour he chooses for that turn.

Runner wins if he can create two paths, one from each of his start cells,
in the appropriate colours, to any points on any of the three short sides.
Blocker wins if Runner has failed in his goal when all the cells are filled.

(*) It is recommended that for email play, the players agree to play
    any number of stones they like, between one and (say) three inclusive.
