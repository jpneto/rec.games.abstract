Here is the story.
I was working on a big abstract game. When I say big I mean very deep with an almost infinite tree but with easy rules. I still did not find which victory condition will be optimal. The game is based on the concept that one player "act" horizontaly and his opponent verticaly. Maybe the concept is not new (I did not try to search on google if it is the case). If it is the case I have to tell it to everyone even if I did know before.
And suddenly I saw the knight with 4 cases controlled horizontaly and 4 verticaly. And after that I saw the rooks. Why not checkers or tokens? and so on. It is like the idea of half-stone but I was really angry because not one of you understood my goal. When you play hex (or go) you just drop stone or token. It costs you nothing! So what if we use half-stone keeping in mind that there is cost to pay to make the complete stone will be finaly yours if some conditions are fullfilled. It did not change the hex game but it will add a sort of fight for some cell. If your opponent succeed then the cell will belong will to him.
