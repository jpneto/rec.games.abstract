Dear net,

	I have no idea what group this is appropriate to, so I am taking
my best guess.  My father-in-law knows that I can't stand not getting a 
riddle, and has challenged my wife and I with the following&gt;

	What is the relation between:  Shafer, Berger and Cabot.

	The "a" in Schafer is an umlaut (spelling?  ie, it can also
be written ae).  The C in Cabot is pronouced "ch" and I am told that
the word is Turkish.  I believe that these are names.

	We have guesses obvious things such as : things to drink at a 
baseball game, manufactueres of pens/pencils, etc.  My father-in-law just
keeps nodding his head in disapproval and says that we are thinking to much 
and that the answer is very simple.  We have been working on this for four
days.  According to my father-in-law, anyone could get this answer, it 
requires no special knowledge.  

	Since I am turning to the net for help, I have basically admitted
some degree of defeat.  However, I would still like to tell him rather than
have him tell us.  I will credit the correct response to the responder and
repost the relationship, no matter how odd the actual answer is, to the net.
If it turns out to be a terribly stupid riddle, I will also post my father-
in-law's Email address and subject him to angry mail from disgruntled netters.

Thanks for you help, and please feel free to ask your friends.  Reposting to
a more appropriate group is also encouraged.  

Sincerely,


John J. Welch,
Roswell Park Cancer Institute
