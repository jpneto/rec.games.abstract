Not quite true.  Twixt was released (in the late 1960s) as one of a
series of about a half dozen `bookshelf' games by -- of all people --
3M.  That's the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the people
who give you PostIt(tm) notes and Scotch Tape.  Their line of games
was quite good, and included Ploy (a chesslike thing), Oh-Wah-Ree (one
flavor of Mancala), Acquire (hotel chains) and Feudal (another
chesslike thing).  They also had a line of smaller games including Sid
Sackson's excellent `Sleuth', and some sports-themed games including
(the only one I own) `Win, Place, and Show'.  This was not a terribly
successful enterprise -- 3M was not really in a position to market
boardgames -- and eventually Avalon Hill bought them out.  AH still
markets some of these, but the physical quality is not nearly as nice
as the old 3M editions.
