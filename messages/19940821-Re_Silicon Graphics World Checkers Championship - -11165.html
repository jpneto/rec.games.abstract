This just proved how silly the title is.  Neither of the contestants
cared about it, and yet we have all these guys jumping on the poor Chinook
team for keeping the silly title for now so that the show at the Computer
Museum can go on.  The press might not care as much about a checkers match
if there is no title involved.  [They did show up in droves when Kasparov
was slaughtering DT in exhibition back in '89, but it was Kasparov, and it
was chess, not checkers.]  If I were the organizers, I might not press
the Chinook team to assume the title, but I would have suggested that
it would be helpful for the publicity of the makeup match with Lafferty,
and all the other events for kids in the Museum...

I realized when I wrote my first post that the chinook team was
dealing with match organizers, sponsors, etc.  But I am not impressed.
I would have taken the high road and refused the title as a matter of
principle.  A principle that gets abandoned simply because you find it
inconvenient is no principle at all.  I seriously doubt that the
Lafferty match or any other events would have been cancelled because
the sponsors had already paid for it.  Even if it did, the ones who
cancelled everything would be at fault and would owe apologies to
Lafferty, the Chinook team, the spectators and the visitors to the
computer museum, etc.

You are being harsh on guys who are as much the victims of circumstances
as Tinsley.

Perhaps.  I understand the decision of Jonathon and the chinook
team but I disagree with it.

The important thing is whether a rematch with Tinsley
happens or not, not the silly title.

That we do agree on.  The rematch with Tinsley is the most important
thing.
