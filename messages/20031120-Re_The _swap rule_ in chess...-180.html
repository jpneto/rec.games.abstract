Not necessarily, because an initial move that's strong in standard chess
is not necessarily strong in swap-chess.

Suppose that Alice starts as White, and Bob as Black.

* Alice doesn't want to make an opening move that is strong in standard
  chess (e.g. P-K4), because Bob will then choose to become White.

* Alice doesn't want to make an opening move that is weak in standard
  chess (e.g. P-KB3), because Bob will then choose to remain Black.

* Assuming that Bob is a reasonably skilled player, Alice's best
  strategy is to make a mediocre move, such that neither of Bob's
  choices (switch or don't switch) is particularly better or worse
  than the other.

ObEasyFollowup:  Why did I choose P-KB3?
