Exactly.  There's no need.  So what's the point?

A little background for the readership:  Corey Clark (or Sackoshitz or
whatever), chases me around the Internet confronting me with dredged
up shit from various forums.  Case in point from yesterday at iggc
(paraphrasing, but real close):

"Mark what's with M-Torus??  I thought it was a Torus but it isn't!
You made me confused!"

I mean how many years ago was this shit?

"Mark, you were picking on Christian Freeling in the Arimaa forum!
He's a way better designer than you!  All your games suck except you
got lucky with Oust!"

Etc., etc., etc. Meanwhile this obsessed, pathological wiseass has
become very skilled at Oust as well as (according to him) adopting my
design philosophy, ingratiating himself in the hopes that I'll grant
him private audience - something that won't happen again.

Jesus Mark, that was positively bipolar of you. "chases me around the
Internet confronting me". Well Mark, I think you might be confusing
Iggamecenter with the entirety of the internet and this is as close as
we've come to a confrontation in quite a while.

I'd like to first say given the seemingly arbitrary change in mood you
are prone to and your overall extreme personality, ingratiation seemed
like the only way to maintain any sort of positive acquaintanceship
with you. It wasn't too hard given that I think you are an excellent
designer (despite what I might say when a mad Steere is charging at
me). Oust is one of the most interesting games I've come across. I was
surprised by Cephalopod. I didn't know a game played on such a small
board could last so many moves, let alone hold my interest for quite
that long. I'll admit I don't play many of your other designs but the
games I'm interested in playing and the games I find interesting from
a design perspective are two entirely separate categories.

I did adopt your design process, which has made designing anything a
rigorous challenge but I only did so because I found that I was in
agreement with you about the necessity to make a game finite and
drawless without turning to ugly metarules like Ko (or even pie in my
case). This is as far as I've taken it.

Yeah, I suppose I am a wiseass but that's not such a bad thing. A lot
of people would call you a tightass Mark. The world is full of asses
of all types. Dumbasses, jackasses, just be glad you are neither of
those.

"Mark, you were picking on Christian Freeling in the Arimaa forum!
He's a way better designer than you!  All your games suck except you
got lucky with Oust!"

I thought we were past this Mark. For god's sake, I only said such a
thing in the first place because you were insulting me, calling me a
retard and whatnot. I'm not exactly thinking of new ways to flatter
you in such a scenario; I'm going straight for the eyes.

So what, if I ask you about M-Torus? If I find you have designed
something that I'm interested in, I'm somehow supposed to know that
you do not want to discuss it? Okay, so the first rule of Mark Steere
is, what? Don't Talk about Mark Steere! Can I guess what the second
rule might be?
Besides as you recall this lead to me linking you to the wikipedia
entry about the Real Projective Plane and you.... thanking me!?! O_0
If you were so offended by this, then why didn't you just tell me I
was a pathological wiseass then and there?

I never practiced Oust Mark, I must have had some crazy natural
ability. Most days I suck at Oust (and games in general) and some days
I surprise myself. And let me just say that the only thing I can think
of that might have triggered this crazy lashing out is that I won that
Oust game and said "mind if I boast about this win?" which just meant
that I wanted to tell raza. I did tell raza because you didn't say no,
you just took off. No big deal.

I think Ralf Gerring is probably easier to get along with. Too bad his
games aren't very interesting.
