Well, as a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>player<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of games, I couldn't give a whit whether a game is
popular or not.  I only care if it brings me some measure of enjoyment
or mental stimulation. . . .  If you are looking solely
to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>study<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, then Chess and Xiangqi are the places to be.  You
simply will not find literature on most others (including the "big
ones" like the GIPF family, etc...).  I personally would rather play a
game than study it any day =)

I've always had strongly mixed feelings about playing games.  And
though I've been that way all my life, I still don't understand it.

The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>idea<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of playing a game always sounds great.  I imagine stepping
outside real life for a while and doing something playful and
artificial--just having fun, sort of immersing myself in an alternate
reality.

But when it gets right down to actually playing a game, I'm at least
somewhat disappointed every time.  I think, "This isn't what I imagined
it'd be.  For one thing there's work involved; it's not all play.
Worse yet, there's competition--and I really don't want to beat
anybody, and I sure don't want to get beaten.  I hadn't really
bargained for all this."

Then, sometimes, there's another turnaround once I'm further into the
game.  When I'm warmed up to it, I start thinking, "Well, this is
pretty interesting--and it's kinda fun too in its way.  Not quite what
I had pictured, but I guess I do like it."

Thanks to these mixed feelings, I've loved games all my life, and yet I
very rarely sit down and play a game with another person (though I play
games on the computer all the time).

The gambler's or sports fan's enthusiasm for gaming is completely alien
to me.  I see such people getting excited over game playing, and it
obviously means a great deal to them, but it's far removed from my
consciousness and lifestyle.  I just don't get it.
