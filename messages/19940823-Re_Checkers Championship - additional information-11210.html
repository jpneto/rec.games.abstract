Is anyone still listening to this guy?  At first it seemed that there
was some legitimate concern that some people might take the situation
the wrong way, and so it was worth explaining the true facts.  Now that
that's been done, as far as I can tell, there is just one bozo who has a
problem with the match.  There's always going to be at least one person
with a chip on the shoulder about something or other.  I suggest that we
all just ignore him and eventually he will go away.

I still have not seen one valid argument countering the claim that the
chinook team displayed less than ideal sportsmanship.  If you want to
express your opinion, then argue the merit of your position.  Personal 
attacks only reflect poorly on yourself.
