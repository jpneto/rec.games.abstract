I will leave it as a fun exercise for fans to compile a list,
hopefully exhaustive, of all the "N positions" (Next player wins),
and all the "P positions" (Previous player wins).

I generated the P positions (and by consequence the N positions)
using a computer program and there are too many to list even for
small numbers of seeds.  First, any position in which the number
of vertices with some seeds is &lt;= 2 is a P position since no
move is possible.  Filtering out these, there are still 35
P positions where no vertex has more than one seed (if you
consider the symmetries, then there are really only 6 distinct
ones but the positions become harder to describe).

6??  I'm not sure what I was thinking but there are only two.
The Fano plane is more symmetric than it appears from a casual
glance at the 2-d diagram.  All points and all lines (including
the "circular" line) are equivalent.

The two positions with no move where at least three distinct
vertices have one seed on them are as follows.  The first position
is obtained by placing a seed at any two distinct vertices and
then placing a third seed at any vertex that is not on the unique
line determined by the first two vertices.  For the second
position, pick any line L.  Then place one seed at each of four
vertices not on line L.

Given an arbitrary position, it's not exactly obvious when
you can move to a position with no following moves.  Hence,
the above characterization is pretty useless when it comes
to playing the game.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Now if you
filter out all positions where there is no move, we are left
with the following (by "restricted" P positions, I mean those
P positions from which there is at least one legal move, the
number of seeds at any vertex is &lt;= N, and at least one vertex
has N seeds).

    # restricted
N   P positions
=   ============
1            0
2          315
3         2500
4         9430
5        27616

Obviously, memorizing a list of positions is not the way to go.
The highly regular structure of the fano plane gives one reason
to hope for a nice elegant way to compute the nimber of an
arbitrary position.
