Definition of combinatorial game, taken from "Lessons in Play, An
Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory" by Michael Albert, Richard
Nowakowski and David Wolfe:

========
In a combinatorial game there are two players who take turns moving
alternately.  Play continues until the player whose turn it is to move has
no legal moves available.  No chance devices such as dice, spinners, or card
deals are involved, and each player is aware of all the details of the game
position (or game state) at all times.  In this text, the rules of each game
we study will ensure that it will end after a finite sequence of moves, and
the winner is often determined on the basis of who made the last move.
Under normal play the last player to move wins.  In misere play the last
player loses.

Well a great  argument all around Mark but it's not going to bring
anyone back to this site. Sorry pal.
