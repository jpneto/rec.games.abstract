Here's a guy who sets 'architecture' above gameplay. It's so funny
that after years of wearing the emperor's clothes, only recently
someone asked him what he actually meant by that, 'architecture'. Does
Flume have 'architecture'. No, it has a simple rule leading to an
intruiging game. Excellent, but where's the 'architecture'? Tell us
what it is Mark, maybe we'll see it. Atoll's architecture? A mystery.
Oust, Fractal?
And if Monkey Queen has an 'architecture', it's a bad one if you care
about gameplay.
