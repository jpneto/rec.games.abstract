TV is as many people say Idiot Box. Play Chess on your Computer.

Here is a Chess game you can play if you have Java Installed.

Play Chess at: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.GetClub.com/Chess.html">http://www.GetClub.com/Chess.html</a>

Chess is interesting only when playing looking at a game we have no
control on what the players are thinking. Once a game is played you
get the moves and then you can analyze on a chess board. But analyzing
on TV is just difficult.

Games at GetClub Chess are recorded so you can analyze them or
gothough the animation of your game. Each move is played every 10
seconds So tyou know how you played.

Bye
Sanny
