Soft finitude is a topic that interests me as well.  Square Oust comes to
mind.  There's exactly one draw position in square Oust, a board completely
filled with black and white stones, arranged in a checkerboard pattern.

Square Oust rule sheet:

Paradoxical question: Does perfect play lead to a checkerboard pattern in
square Oust?  I really don't know, but maybe it does.

My reservation about soft finitude is that where clever humans are involved,
soft finitude might find a way to make itself harder.

'Being down to 7 while your opponent is down to 3' doesn't say all
that much. The choice between 'running the clock' and 'going for the
jugular' makes it sound as if material is all that matters. Instead,
you may be in a lost position on the board despite having 7 to 3
reserves.

Yes, my example was an oversimplification.  But the point I was trying to
make was not that material is all that matters.  Only that material does
matter.

In MQ checkmate is the main objective and terminates
a game regardless of the material reserve of either
player.
The second objective is only aimed at forced finitude in
case of mutual incapability to checkmate. A means to an
end, in my opinion.

This is where you're right and it's also where you're wrong.  The checkmate
is sexy.  Grinding two stacks of checkers down until one of them bottoms out
isn't.  But the grind is what the game is about.  It's the base note.  The
checkmate is a lovely top note but only a top note.

The checkmate may be "preferred" in a sense.  It's the most likely outcome
by far among beginners and may (or may not) continue to be the most likely
outcome with advancing skill.  Players will improve at perpetrating
checkmate but they'll also improve at evading it.  The grind.  The base
note.  Gotta have it.
