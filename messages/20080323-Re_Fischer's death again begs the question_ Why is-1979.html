Well, it mucks up rating.  Either ratings can't follow the
points, or else you have built in inflation.  That's a "practical"
problem;  whether it matters is something else.

Not really.  You are going to get cases where player A
scores more points than player B [who gets more draws] against
the same standard of opposition, but B gets the higher rating
as a consequence.  Many players are somewhat precious about
their ratings, so that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> going to cause problems.

This is an interesting exchange of view relating scoring and rating. 
Somewhat in support of David Kane's exploratory propositions, I believe he 
has said elsewhere in these threads that the current system is not 
necessarily superior to any changed system - and which <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>also<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> is a factor in 
players motivations.

Evidently, as Andy Walker points out, both scoring and ratings are factors 
considered by the player in fighting the game out, and IMO, these might not 
be distinguishable.

eg; last round scenario where stronger player agrees a draw against a weaker 
player, both are motivated to accept the draw since the stronger player 
clinches first place, and the weaker player gets a ratings boost.

If indeed "Many players are somewhat precious about their ratings, so that 
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> going to cause problems", then aren't those the sorts of problems we 
need?

To wit; if you want to maintain your rating then don't give up the draw and 
fight it out - and this may motivate players on an individual basis.

In terms of scoring, organisers might like a differentiated black/white 
score for draws, since more decisive games add drama to their events.
