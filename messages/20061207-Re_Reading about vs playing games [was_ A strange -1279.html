Well, as with all things in life, you need to find balance, and that's
something only you can really do.  The truth is (IMHO of course) that
truly excelling at any one of these games (at least to the level I get
the sense you would like to) would indeed take a lifetime...more than a
lifetime actually.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes.  That's both the upside and downside to it.  When I first learned
to play chess at age twelve, the idea of dedicating a lifetime to it
sounded appealing--but I was far too indecisive to take that plunge,
even if I'd had the aptitude (and I don't think I did).  Now, some
forty years later, I'm getting close to where I can only afford to take
things one day at a time.

I have no illusions about what level of excellence I might be able to
achieve at this point in my life.  I'd be happy to just get past being
a novice and arrive at an intermediate level--which would end up being
my "personal best."  I'd like to be able to honestly say I'm a decent
amateur player of some game.  If a stranger in a coffee shop suggested
a game, I'd like to be able to agree and be confident that I could put
up some kind of intelligent fight.

But in truth, it's mainly just a matter of mental exercise for me; I do
almost all my game playing on the computer nowadays.

(BTW, I would argue that Chess has been obsolete
for some time.  I'm not a personal lover of Draughts, but it remains a
better game IMO).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's an interesting viewpoint!  I think I've only heard one person
call chess obsolete, and he meant it has been superceded by computer
games (since they can be far more complex without becoming
unmanageable).

It's refreshing to hear someone opine that draughts is a better game.

Chess requires a vast amount of study and
memorization.  Kasparov and others on the International scene have had
to make great personal sacrifices to get to where they are and maintain
it.  I'm a graduate student, personally, and came very early to the
realization that certain of my profs may be absurdly knowledgeable and
talented, but they too made life-long sacrifices for that knowledge.  I
daresay the vast majority of people have neither the time nor intense
passion necessary to truly master certain of these areas.  That's not a
bad thing either =)  There is certainly more to life than Chess,
Bridge, or in my case Musicology.  I personally love abstract games and
am too a bit of a perfectionist and wish I could really excel at them,
but I've decided instead that I would just rather <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and let the
aptitude simply come over time.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, I've run into that over and over again.  It reminds me of when I
was sitting in a graduate English class, listening to a lecture--and
suddenly I realized that although I *could,* I really wouldn't want to
make a career in academia.

Still, I catch myself sometmies indulging in a bit of "hero
worship"--admiring the level of excellence someone else has achieved;
and that inspires me to forge ahead in that field too.  I usually come
to my senses by the time I face the first little challenge.

When it comes to games, the abstracts are the most admirable, so I keep
coming back to them.  But my temperament keeps me dreaming, reading,
and writing rather than practicing, and so I end up being a perpetual
novice.  I'm not at all happy about that.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As for choosing a handful of games to sort of "dedicate yourself" to, I
certainly wouldn't restrict yourself to Chess and Checkers.  Both are
ancient games that have been studied to death.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, but not by me.  :)  An extreme case is Nine Men's Morris, which
has been "solved"--meaning someone managed to program a computer to
play a perfect game.  Now everybody knows how it comes out if both
sides are played optimally.  But unlike computers, people don't make
perfect moves all the time.  So, the outcome is still uncertain between
two human players, and the game can still be enjoyed.  And while
they're having fun playing, two human players (or even just one playing
against a computer) can also work on improving.

To me, that's what game playing is all about--fun and improvement.
Sometimes one has to take a back seat to the other, but both are
important.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
(Chess is one of those
games about which more books have been published than almost any other
subject.)  The current method of study really is primarily memorizing
past games with some actual calculation in the mid-game.  I started
down that path years ago and it just took all the "fun" away for me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I can see how it would.  Me, I've never gotten nearly that far.  I've
been kind of a "Boswell" to the chess world--I know the names and
histories of some of the top players, the names of openings, and so
forth, and yet I practice so seldom that my rating has probably never
been much above 1000.  Much of the time I play what Dan Heisman calls
"hope chess"--just making moves that feel right and hoping my opponent
blunders more than I do.

Even so, the game is actually fun for me--and I have gradually improved
every time I've stuck with it for any length of time.  That's
encouraging.

What's discouraging is knowing that there are some five-year-olds who
could beat me at chess.  And that I'm not much better at chess now than
I was back in high school.  Considering all the attention I've put on
the game over the years, you'd think I could at least play a decent
game.  But "attention" doesn't count; only disciplined practice does.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Draughts is better, but still a very "understood" game IMO.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Understood to the point where the best computer programs are at least
on par with the best human players, and where three-move ballots have
been introduced into tournament play to ensure variety and reduce the
frequency of drawn games.

But there again, that's at the tournament level, and I'm just a
floundering novice.  I don't have the slightest hope of winning local
tournaments, much less ever being a world-class player.

I would like to learn to play a decent game of checkers, though--to be
able to offer an intelligent challenge to a fellow amateur, or maybe
play at an intermediate level.  I'd like to at least be able to say
that I understand checkers and can tell what's going on in a game--that
it's not such a mystery to me.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
That said,
you will certainly be able to easily find opponents for these games.
That will certainly be a factor in your decision.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, yes and no.  In truth, I may never play a game of chess or
checkers against another human being.  I don't know anyone who's into
either game, and I'm not motivated to play online or join a club or
anything.  There are computer programs that play these games very well
and can be "dumbed down" to my skill level, and I'm perfectly content
to just play against the computer.

But at the same time, a big part of the appeal of chess and checkers is
that these games are so widely popular and have such long histories.
When I play a quick game of chess on my Palm at lunchtime, I'm
conscious of engaging in a time-honored contest--one that has generated
vast amounts of literature and still makes world news at times.  That
feeling of being involved in something so classic and significant is
satisfying to me--even though I'm just playing the game at a novice
level on a little computer.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As for other
abstracts, there are soooooooo many out there.  Many truly interesting
ones as well. . . .  there's lots to choose from; most of them
won't have any literature on them either. . . .
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The lack of literature is actually a downside to me, because I love
reading about a game I'm interested in.  Chess is perhaps more
appealing than any other game just <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>because<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of all the literature on
it.  The literature exalts it to some kind of lofty, legendary status,
making excellence at chess a sort of Holy Grail to pursue.  In
contrast, who would know or care if I turned out to be a grown-up
"child prodigy" at Abalone or Twixt or Gipf?

Also, I need all the guidance I can get.  Or at least I feel I do.
Lately I've been playing some Nine Men's Morris--and much to my
surprise I'm actually discovering some "dos and don'ts" just via trial
and error.  But my chess rating would probably still be well <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>below<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
1000 if I'd never read about pawn centers, forks, skewers, and such.
Besides, I usually enjoy reading strategy guides more than actually
playing.

So, in my choice between chess and checkers, one thought that crossed
my mind is that it's too bad there's so <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>little<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> literature available
on checkers.  What there is is hard to find, and I've seen very little
that's well written--and hardly anything that's inspirational.  Some
novice-oriented chess books are very well written and get me all fired
up about the game, wanting me to play more and get better at it.  But
checkers books always seem to launch right into dry calculation--which
is necessary but not very appealing.  I'd appreciate a few more
anecdotes and metaphors.

In the last couple days, though, I've taken a renewed liking to
checkers.  Compared to chess, it's cleaner, simpler, and quicker--and
yet it still has far more depth than I can ever hope to fathom.

I remember playing checkers with my dad when I was ten years old or so.
 I asked him about chess, and he said, "I don' t know how to play
chess.  You have to be really smart to play that game."  Years later, I
found out you have to be just as smart to play checkers well.

But it's not enough to be smart either; you have to put your nose to
the grindstone and work long and hard at it.

I'll never work that long and hard--there's no time for it.  I'll be
happy if I can just train myself to pause and think ahead instead of
making mostly impulsive moves.  It'd be a big win for me if I could
just notice my opponent's two-for-one shot while there's still time to
prevent it.  It'd be a bigger win if I could get to where I win most
all the time on Novice level and can hold my own at Intermediate level.
