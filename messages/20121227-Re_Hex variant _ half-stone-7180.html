Your "dual" is a red herring.  Every cell in the yellow tessellation can be morphed into a perfect hexagon, each of which is surrounded by six perfect hexagons - the honeycomb pattern of Hex.

No, Mark, duals help a lot. I've already explained why those two tessellations are not equivalent, but here's one more argument: in Hex, it takes twice as many moves to connect one pair of opposite vertices than the other, whereas, in the board I made, which is the dual of the yellow tessellation, it takes roughly the same number of moves to connect both pairs of opposite vertices. (It takes one move less to connect the NE and SW vertices because of the missing upper right corner, which can't be used for trivalency reasons.) This property is retained even if the grid is rotated 45º, with the difference that the game would be asymmetric and therefore even more obviously not Hex. 

The cells in the yellow tessellation can't be morphed into perfect hexagons.. This is again obvious if you draw the dual grid of it.
