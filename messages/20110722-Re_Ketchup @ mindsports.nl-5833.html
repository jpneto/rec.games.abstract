As a starting point Occam's Razor would suggest that a loop prevents
further growth, period.
That would make it a confuguration players would try to avoid.

On the other hand it's there like an unused part, flashing in neon,
craving functionality.

This is a good point to try and see whether there are things that
don't feel quite right in actual play. There's always the option to
make the loop functional if it can remedy or improve one aspect or the
other.
Right up your alley :) Not really up mine, unless Ed makes an applet.

If I saw the possibility of a draw as a real problem, I'd think I'd
have a long look at this unused entity.
But I don't.
So barring other problems the loop, if at all, aspires elegant
functionality of a yet to be determind form.
