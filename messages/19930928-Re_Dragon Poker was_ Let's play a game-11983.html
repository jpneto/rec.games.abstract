 And for Calvinball, I don't remember anywhere in the strip where Calvin 
or Hobbes flat-out contradicted a previous rule or where one gave two 
consecutive rules.  Seems like they would be rules(probably unspoken 
because they are well- known)to the game, otherwise it wouldn't really be 
playable.  Also, they never set a condition which makes themselves 
automatically the victor that I know of.

There is one very simple reason for all of this. The game is fun. The
entire purpose of the game is to enjoy it. Neither player is going to do
anything that will win <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>now<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, because then the game is over. Where's the
fun in that? Either player may do absolutely anything, but there are
things that will not happen, because they aren't fun.

Hmm, something from a star trek show?  3-D chess(from the show) has 
official rules, I just can't remember the publication(although the rules 
were a little vague on a couple of points)

There was a game in DS9 - it was some first contact episode, and the
aliens loved games. Quark got involved in one (they weren't too pleased
with his cheating in his games), and was never told the rules. It was
half way through the game when he realised that his players were real
people.

I have a game. Any number of people can play, taking turns. Each turn, a
player says something (anything at all). The winner is the first to say
'I win'. This player then gets a number of points equal to the number of
turns played in that round. You can keep playing until everyone gets
bored. Then you add up your points, and the highest score wins the game.
Is this an interesting game?
