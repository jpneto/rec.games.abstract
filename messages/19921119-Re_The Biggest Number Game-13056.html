It has been claimed that these sentences "make no sense".  I disagree.  To
explain why, let's first look at a formalization of the problem.

For some string S, define the Komolgorov complexity of S (denoted K(S)) be
the length of the shortest pair of a turing machine and a string &lt;M,S'&gt;
s.t. M(S')=S.  (Pick your favorite encoding for TMs and pairs.)  E.g., K(S)
&lt;= |&lt;M_id,S&gt;| = <code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>S<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code>+c for all strings S, where M_id is the identity
function and c is the associated overhead of pairing a string with it.

Now, assume an alphabet of {0,1} and interpret strings as binary encodings
of natural numbers (written as the number itself).  We can interpret these
English sentences as denoting TMs that take the empty string (e) as input
and search for a number that satisfies some condition involving the
(recursively enumerable) lexicographic ordering of all TMs M_1,M_2,... and
the (recursively enumerable) lexicographic ordering of natural numbers
0,1,....

For instance, Gerald's sentence (replacing 20 with k) would be a TM M s.t.
M(x) = `the smallest i such that K(i) &gt; k'.  And if k &gt; |&lt;M,e&gt;|, there is
an inconsistency because K(M(e)) would be &gt; |&lt;M,e&gt;|.  Contradiction!!

How exactly did this contradiction creep in?  It's actually an illusion!
We've cheated by including the uncomputable computation K(i) in the "code"
for M.  In fact, the function that we want M to perform is not computable,
and so there really is no such M.  Therefore, there is no inconsistency.

How does all this relate back to English sentences?  The notion of an
English sentence "describing" a number is analogous to a program that
outputs a number.  So, a sentence describes a number iff there is an
"effective procedure" (a philosophical notion in the loosest sense) that
extracts that number from the sentence.  However, if one uses the
commonly-accepted Church-Turing notion for "effective procedure", then
Gerald's sentence above DESCRIBES NO NUMBER since it is in general not
effectively computable to determine the smallest number described by a
sentence of bounded size.  This is precisely analogous to the machine M
that we tried to define above, but could not.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction in sentences of the form of the examples that Gerald or
Warren provide.  Since they do not qualify as descriptions of numbers
themselves, there is no paradoxical self-reference.  They are
"meta-descriptions" if you will, or descriptions equipped with Oracles.
Either way, they are drawn from a different class from
effectively-computable descriptions, and so there is no contradiction.  It
is this structure that the informality of English hides.
