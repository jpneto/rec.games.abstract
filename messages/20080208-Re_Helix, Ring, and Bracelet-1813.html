Here is a "proof".

Now, look at this path.  From the central intersection,
go up the vertical line, up it from the bottom, turn right
down the diagonal line, and go right around to come in
from the left again, back to the intersection.

"go right around"  ??  The only way to go encircle the board from E to
W is to follow the entire helix.

This path has done a complete west-to-east
circumnavigation, and (a careful tracking will show!)
no N-S circumnavigation at all.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's totally absurd.  The only way to encircle the board from E to W
is to follow the entire length of the helix.  By doing that you also
encircle the board from N to W.

In spite of the confusing instructions, I think I finally understand
your game.  You're saying that Z can win by forming a non-helical E-W
loop or either type of helix, and that N can win by forming a non-
helical N-S loop or either type of helix.  In the case that two
helices are formed, one black and one white, the slope determines the
winner.  Am I right?

And you might also try to be less touchy, egotistical, and
dismissive of others.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course I'm touchy.  I announce my game and you come on and shout
"Hey, that's my game!  Except I explained it more clearly and drew
pictures!"  What an ass!  Your rule set is totally different from
mine.  You are also not the first to announce a toroidal game here.
You're the third!

I'm not being egocentric.  I'm responding to your charge that a
similar, hexagonally tessellated game can't have the property that a
filled board has exactly one winner.  My game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> played on a
