I don't agree with you, Torben.

There are four main reasons why the possibility of draws doesn't
necessarily make a fairer game than the absence of them:
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I wasn't stating sufficient conditions, only necesary: A game without
draws can never be (theoretically) fair, but a game that allows draws
can (but doesn't have to) be.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
1.- Assuming the game in question is not trivial, we don't know
whether perfect play would result in a draw,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True.  But if draws are not possible, perfect play <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>will<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> lead to a
win for one specific side.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
and the less frequent draws are, the less probable it is.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That I don't agree.  If side A and side B win equally often (with
imperfect play), then no matter how infrequent draws are, this would
indicate (but not prove) a fair game.  On the other hand, if draws are
frequent but side A wins more often than side B, this is an indication
(but, again, no proof) of an unfair game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
2.- Even if draws are rare enough, that doesn't ensure that a drawn
game is a perfect game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed not.  Even the converse -- that perfect play will lead to a
draw -- is not certain.  But if no draw is possible, you definitely
know that one side has an advantage.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3.- It may occur that a game is not balanced for both sides while
still being a draw if played perfectly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Only if perfect play is inherently more difficult for one side than
for the other, so you would need a game with assymetric rules for this
to happen.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.- If we could play that perfect game, its result wouldn't matter
anymore, because the game would then lose much of its interest.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is, indeed, true.  But even if we don't play perfectly, the fact
that one side has a certain win with perfect play makes it likely that
this side has an advantage even without perfect play.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In short: it is not the presence or absence of draws what makes a game
more or less fairer, but the fact that both sides have equal winning
chances.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can't really talk about winning chances in a deterministic game:
It is all about skill.  You could make experiments with random moves
and see which side wins more often, but it is unlikely that random
moves will be anywhere near normal play, so such an experiment would
not give any indication of who has the advantage in normal play.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Chess is a good example of an unfair game that allows (and to
what extent!) draws.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't think it has been proven that perfect play leads to a draw in
Chess, and the fact that White wins more often than Black may be an
indication that this isn't the case.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And theres is yet another problem with draws: even if they are
uncommon, there is always the annoying possibility that they become
more and more frequent as the players skill grows.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed.  If perfect play will lead to a draw, draws will become more
and more common as players approach perfect play.

On the same note, if perfect play ensures, say, a White win, then as
players become more skilled, White wins will become more and more
frequent.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Draughts is a good example: two amateurs can play it and draw just
one in ten games, but two proffessional players will draw 90% of the
time.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is rather extreme, and an indication that Checkers is not a very
good game for experts.  Other games, like Go, definitely allow draws
but you rarely see draws in games between experts.  There is no proof
that perfect play will lead to a draw (or a certain win for one side).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I therefore think that the impossibility of draws is a good
guarantee that the game will pass the test of expert play.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Hardly.  Games like Nim have no possibility of draw but definitely do
not pass the test of perfcet play -- players can learn to play
perfectly, so games between experts lead to the predetermined win.
