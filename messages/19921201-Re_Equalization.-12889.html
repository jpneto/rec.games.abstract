|&gt; Equalization in chess doesn't seem to be a good idea.
|&gt; It does not avoid the necessary of learning analysed
|&gt; openings. Quite the reverse. Consider the following
|&gt; situation:
|&gt; 
|&gt; Player A is a specialist in a certain opening.
|&gt; Player B feels very uncomfortable playing this opening.
|&gt; With his first two white and one black moves he can
|&gt; force the situation on the board to a preferred
|&gt; structure. Now he is able to play the game with both
|&gt; white and black very well (because he has learned the
|&gt; analysed theory of this opening). But player B hates
|&gt; this opening, no matter whether he elects black or white.
|&gt; So Player A has got a big advantage.

Quite on the contrary, I think, this could be a good form of chess
since players would have to have a wider (and hence shallower!!)
opening reportoire.  This would avoid the 20-30-first-moves-from-
theory tendencies sometimes seen in chess today, and would
create more exciting situations quicker...

Of course, knowledge of opening theory would still be a big
advantage, but general understanding of opening principles and
versatility would become comparatively more important.

(Although deep down I prefer the game as it is... :-))
