I'm not sure, but I notice you do not mention the case x=1.
At first, I thought this would be a sure win for B, until I
saw bids must be &lt; 1. But this leads to a problem with the
game definition. Suppose x=1. If players could bid exactly 1,
B could win by bidding 1 immediately. Either the ball moves
to B immediately, or both players run down to 0, and B wins
by virtue of the ball being closer to B. But if players must
bid less than 1, it is in B's interest to immediately bid
a value larger than A. That's like asking two players to
simultaneously bid any integer, and the larger value wins.
B wants to bid a value 1-epsilon where epsilon is closer
to zero than A's epsilon. This leads to practical problems.
How many pages of symbolic notation would be allowed, to
define this value? Would recursive definitions be allowed?
What a mess!

I agree p(x) = 1 if x &gt; 1. Suppose x is of the form 1+alpha
where alpha &gt; 0. B immediately bids 1 - (alpha/2). The only
way to avoid immediate loss, is for A to bid more than B.
This leaves A with something less than alpha/2. B can then
win the next two bids in a row, by bidding alpha/2 each
time.

You also do not mention x = 1/2, but p(x)= 0 there.
A bids 1/2 immediately. The only way B can stop A is by
bidding the full 1/2, leaving B with 0, and A wins.
If B bids 0 on the initial bid, A can still win on the
next bid with 1/2, since either A wins or both players
run out with the ball closer to A.

Did I misinterpret your rules? Is a bid of 1 allowed?

I'm not sure p(x) is even well defined for .5 &lt; x &lt; 1.
Assumptions have to be made about the likelihood of
players making certain bids. A probablilty distribution
over the range of allowed bid values for each move.
Presumably, such a distribution would be based on 
the assumption that each player will strive to maximize
their likelihood of winning. But this is a circular
definition, is it not? Am I being too simplistic?
