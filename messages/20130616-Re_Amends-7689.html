Mark, I haven't been on here in forever but I'd like to say I appreciate the apology and would like to in kind apologize for some of my behavior towards you in the past. I feel like we get along with each other better than we do anyone else in this community, which is odd. I think some of the stuff we've said would be enough to put some people on permanently bad terms with eachother but somehow we always shrug it off and that shows we ultimately have good repport with each other. 

However this thread also brings to mind another issue entirely. Christian's outstanding apology for lampooning me in his dreadfully derivitive game Turd the spirit of which somehow lives on in Monkey Queen and the less popular Cyclix. And I will wait on that with baited breath right now.
