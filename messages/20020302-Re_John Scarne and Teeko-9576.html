Hello,

And there's also the fact that he can't even read. After all, if he
could, being so interested in Teeko, he would surely have gone to the

You know that this is a link to a website which is only for paying
subscribers of the Washington Post. One hint to them would mean
that they will take legal steps against you because posting this link to
a newsgroup is clearly illegal. You should hold your tongue in your own
best interest! Why do you coquet with illegal acts you have committed?

Hee hee--I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>thought<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that, being unable to refute the message, you would
attack the messenger, though I expected you to accuse me of hideous acts
of copyright violation for quoting 14 lines from the article.
Apparently, though, you think that one can get into a pay site without a
password. Well, I'll tell you what: feel free to tell the Washington
Post of my 'crime' and see how concerned they are about it. I'll be
quaking in my boots over in the corner. But don't tell them that you
quoted the URL too!

the tournament was a promotional event; Scarne challenged 10 people --
Braddock; actors Judy Holliday and Walter Slezak; national champions of
chess and bridge -- to play Teeko against him simultaneously. Scarne
offered a $1,000 prize to anyone who could win two out of three games.

I.e. nobody had the slightest chance to win money! Scarne won all 30
games.

Um, and the relevance of this to anything is what? Incidentally, it was
20, unless some people were so caught up by the game that they kept
playing after they couldn't win. (And presumably plugged the game in
print, or praised the game in their biographies, or wrote testimonials
for Scarne, or.... Actually, we do know that James Braddock did like the
game enough to write a testimonial. That's the only person we can

search of Usenet will add you and me. And maybe there are a few more in

Every tournament is a promotional event. This is true for every
Go tournament I went to as well as for the recent Neutreeko tournament.
The organizers of tournaments always want to promote their game: they
invite the media, they hope that some newcomers will drop in, etc.
There is nothing wrong with it. It doesn't say anything about the
intentions of the participants. They may participate to win money, to have
fun, to prove that they are the better players, etc.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Exactly. And specifically, to get back to what brought this into the
discussion, it says nothing about the popularity of the game, even with
the participants. But I never said there was anything wrong with
promotional events. <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>You<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> were the one who talked about 'prostitution'.

Not to mention
&lt;&lt;It's unclear whether Scarne actually sold the hundred thousand or half
million Teeko sets he claimed.&gt;&gt;
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You can doubt everything! You could also doubt the claims of
Parker Brothers or Gigamic. Perhaps the World Trade Center was
destroyed by the CIA... What do you think? Are all Americans liars?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, but Scarne was. And more generally, I've found entrepreneurial game
inventors are wont to exaggerate the successes and merits of their
games. And more generally still, entrepreneurial inventors are wont to
exaggerate the successes and merits of their inventions. 

I would believe Sid Sackson's accounts of his accomplishments, because
his books indicate that he's not prone to blowing his own horn. I'd take
Gary Gabrel's claims of a million Pente sets with a grain of salt,
because I don't know anything about him. I'd question anything Scarne
said about his accomplishments on principle, based on the books of his I
own (including <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Scarne on Cards<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Skarney<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>). For that matter, in the
wake of Enron (or even before, actually), I wouldn't take the claims of
Parker Brothers as gospel either.

I think there is overwhelming evidence that Teeko was widely played,
not only in the USA, but also in South Africa. The weak aspect of the
Washington Post article is that the journalist drew the conclusion that
Teeko existed mostly in the mind of John Scarne, BEFORE he started his
field "research". The whole article is overshadowed by this prejudice,
while at the same time he reluctantly admits again and again that the game
was perhaps known to more people than just Scarne.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, of course it was known to more people than just Scarne. The
question is whether it was the most popular abstract game of the 50s. I
think the evidence is so slender that we can't tell. I also think the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>absence<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of solid evidence suggests that it was no big deal. And I
think the journalist comes across as more trustworthy than Scarne.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
BTW Scarne says in his book that Teeko was played in Frankfurt, Germany.
Frankfurt. Frankfurt has one of the largest US military bases in
Germany. Although nobody knows for sure, the game was presumably played by
American soldiers (and the "club" probably closed down when they moved
back to the States).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, what you have adduced so far is (1) the claims of someone you
yourself admit to be an exaggerator, claims that I've pointed out are of
questionable relevance even if true, (2) a promotional photo from an
event that cost Scarne $5000 to get ten people willing to be
photographed playing, and (3) the statement that Teeko was played in
Frankfurt--no mention of the size of the club. Is there even any
evidence that a club existed, as opposed to two or three casual players,
one of whom wrote to Scarne? Just asking.

If your word for that evidence of popularity is 'overwhelming', I think
you'd better do some more work with your 'English for Xglarnians'
textbook.
