Yes, when we play the rectangular version we allow diagonals.
It definitely spices things up, otherwise hex and quad would be too similar.

Hey!  Never thought of that; (though we should've - our email diagrams look
very "unfinished" with one "loose end"!) That sounds like a very good idea,
and I hope Joao and Richard might agree.  It also makes the game more
naturally CGT-like, as there is a natural "addition of games", WW style.

And it leads to the obvious extension that there might even be more than
one such snake/chain, with 2n live ends for n snakes.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>VERY<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> CGT!


We are still open to nice names for naming this nameless game.

I feel the hex and quad versions should have related names.

Any suggestions from the crowd?

   There is only the one universal abstract game, played on a giant board.
   And whenever we play, we are just resolving one minuscule region of it.
