Interesting game.  Thanks Christian.

Rules are always clear to the inventor :)

My problem is usually turning a mechanism into an organism, that is:

It's bizarre.  Bill Taylor has been repetitively declaring the death of
rec.games.abstract for almost two months now.  It's a plot to destroy the
group by making everyone drowsy.  GOD I FEEL SORRY FOR BILL TAYLOR'S
STUDENTS !!

If you let the rules sink in, you'll find it is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
organism,  and there's no separation between entering
and movement. That's one thing I aimed at.

And something I believe you succeeded at, Christian.  My point was not that
I don't like your game.  If there even was a point, it was that my vote will
be totally unbiased.  If Bill Taylor enters a game I like more than yours,
I'll give it a higher rating.

The vote doesn't concern me all that much,

Me neither.  I know I have virtually no chance of winning, with my hunting
style  :)   All prey, small and large, are eluding me now.

I think it's a nice game and once the applet is
there, we may actually play it and find out for
sure :) .

Yes, the gameplay certainly matters.  I didn't have high hopes for Daniel's
game, Charisma, but playing it totally changed my mind.

One more tiny complaint about Soar, and you can get revenge on me when I
enter my game, assuming I get one in the next three months, which I'm
already working at.  The maintaining of separate piles of like colored
stones...
