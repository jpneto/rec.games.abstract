|&gt; |Nasty indeed! I tried to analyze a version with only two lines,
|&gt; |and any real number between 0 and one's score as a possible bid.
|&gt; |So what is B's probability of winning in the following position
|&gt; |assuming perfect play?
|&gt; |
|&gt; |    |  |       Score
|&gt; |  A |  O B     A: 1
|&gt; |    |  |       B: x
|&gt; |
|&gt; |Let's call it p(x). Clearly p(x) = 0 for x &lt; 1/2, and p(x) = 1
|&gt; |for x &gt; 1. I found it tricky to work out p(x) for 1/2 &lt; x &lt; 1. 
|&gt; |Eventually I came up with p(x) = 2 - 1/x, but it's not really
|&gt; |a proof (yet). Is it right, though?
|&gt; 
|&gt; I'm not sure, but I notice you do not mention the case x=1.
|&gt; At first, I thought this would be a sure win for B, until I
|&gt; saw bids must be &lt; 1.
|
|I don't see where he said bids were &lt; 1.  He said "between 0 and
|one's score".  And if you allow bids of exactly 0 or one's score,
|then you eliminate all those nasty questions of "who can name the
|smaller epsilon".

Okay, my bad.

|Given this, you can generalise the position by observing that
|multiplying both player's scores by the same amount (other than
|zero) has no effect on the probability.  So then, given a pair of
|scores, you can represent each player's strategy as a probability
|distribution P(s) where P(s) is the probability that the player
|bids s.  (Or perhaps the probability he bids less than or equal
|to s; I'm not sure which works better.)  The function P(s) will,
|of course, be a function of the two scores.  Then B's chance of
|winning is the double-integral across all possible bids by both
|players, of the chance of those particular bids, times the
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^
|probability of B winning given the resulting scores.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of your P(s) is to find a value for the original
poster's p(x), correct?

p(x) is the probability of B winning from the given initial
position. You are calculating this probability, in terms of
the probabilites of winning from all the possible positions that
can result after one bid.

Strictly from a practical point of view, how are all those
probabilities to be calculated? It would seem, the same
process would have to be applied to most of those positions
as well, which would imply that most of the (uncountably infinite?)
2-ply positions have to be evaluated the same way, etc.
