I'm actually interested to give Cyclix a try.  My designs will never stray
far from the combinatorial style.  They won't venture too far into
Chess-likeness because I don't understand Chess well enough.  I'd be out of
my element selecting knights, rooks, etc. and where to place them.

Yep, Chess implies arbitrary choices. Shogi is a great game and it
doesn't need a mere mortal like me to say so. But its set of pieces is
totally arbitrary. I feel uncomfortable with that.
Yari Shogi strives for a complete set and as 'unarbitrary' as it can
possibly get.
Congo was devised by an eight year old, specifically (from my point of
view) to see what a magical mind, not bothered by logic and structure,
would come up with.
You really would have to invest some serious thoughts into devising an
unplayable chess game.

Cyclix seems ideally suited for the iggc sandbox if you want to give it a whirl.

Yes, pieces are available, and stones make perfect 'holes'. Anytime
tomorrow :)
