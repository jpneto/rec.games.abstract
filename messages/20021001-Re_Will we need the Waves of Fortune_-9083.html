Even for games like backgammon
there will be a perfect strategy to follow that maximises your winning
chances in any position.  Once both players have seen this they will
simply employ this strategy in every game they play.

In games of hidden information there's the possibility
of bluffing (like in Poker) which might change the
analysis of the other player. A player which have
a bad position will devoid from the perfect strategy
to try to get an eventual better hand.

Of course, I'm not talking about perfect players.
Perfect players - like Trabsact Sagme would say - could
only be excited by 100% luck, since skill does not keep
any more secrets from them, they know the Game-Tree.

I suppose there might be some excitement in watching such a game develop and
seeing how it turns out, but this would be no different really from the
excitement in "Beggar your neighbor" which actually involves no skill
whatsoever, and not even any luck once the pack of cards has been shuffled.

precisely!

I wonder if, sometime, most of these games will have the

Just because computers can play a game better than people, it doesn't
follow that people will stop playing and enjoying the game.

yes, until a future when that sentence will make no sense at all...

(Chess being a good example of this (OK - for most people :))
