|&gt; I am interested in information about good games played on a board consisting
|&gt; of hexagonal pieces (usually Hexagonal shape too). Also I would be
|&gt; interested in how to get boards for the following games.
|&gt;

|One nice game is tantrix. which is also a set of puzzles.

Tantrix looks very similar to Kaliko (which is currently out of stock).

That site also has Batalo, which looks worthwhile. They also have tons of
puzzles.

|One idea I had was to buy Hexagonal shaped wood pieces that can be assembled
|to the board depending on the game. War game mats have also struck me as a
|candidate but I don't know much about that market.

I recommend you go to the "factory second" link there, especially if you will
be cutting the mat up into the desired board shape. A Battlemat with 1" hexes
can be cut into a hexagonal shape of (at least) 8 hexes on each side. If you
have a sewing machine, you could zigzag stitch the edges with colored thread
to label them and prevent any possible fraying.

If you're also looking for tokens, Go stones are at
