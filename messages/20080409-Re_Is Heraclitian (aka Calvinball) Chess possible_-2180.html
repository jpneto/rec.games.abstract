So the basic framework for the ultimate chess variant would be: Can
you have a framework for chess and variants that would enable a person
to NEVER play chess the same way twice (by the exact same set of
rules)?

It's only to easy. I have a very long, regular sequence of such
variants. Each is very much like standard chess. Each next one differs
only a little from the previous one. You use the standard chess
board, and standard pieces, only possibly more than in the standard
chess, depending on the game (the starting position is always the
same).

Furthermore, for a greater variety, I have 255 of such different
sequences (plus standard chess on the top of it :-)

I claim that each sequence is very long and not infinnite
because I am talking about games which are essentially
different, and not just formally -- if we treat the repetition
rule seriously then I consider each of my 255 sequences of
variants to be finite. (There are still more than plenty of them :-)
