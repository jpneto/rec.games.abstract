<br>&nbsp;The pentomino pieces are put into a "pool" accessible
<br>to both players.&nbsp; Players alternate turns.
<br>&nbsp;On a player's turn, he takes a piece from the "pool"
<br>and places it in any empty area on the board.
<br>&nbsp;The first player to be unable to place a piece
<br>on the board loses the game.

<br>This is fairly well known.

<br>As far as I can see, it is possible to have a never-ending game, so
<br>some mechanism to avoid this should be introduced.&nbsp; You could make it
<br>illegal to repeat a position.
<br>
<br>Another variant of the basic rules is to use a standard 8x8 checker
<br>board and let one player play white and the other black.&nbsp; Play is as
<br>the basic rules (place pentominoes until no further move is
<br>possible), but let the winner be the player with most squares of his
<br>own colour uncovered at the end of the game.

<br>&nbsp;this could result in a tie game...but you could have the last
<br>&nbsp;guy to play get 1/2 point for last play.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;the X has a unique property, 4:1.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;now, let each player give the piece the other player has
<br>&nbsp;to play....
<br>
<br>&nbsp;...and we almost have a distant variant of Xong.&nbsp; :-o
