People say that linear algebra is different from other undergrad math

classes. Where is the abstract thinking part of linear algebra?

It depends on the linear algebra course.  Nowadays many of them are
just about as cookbook as most calculus courses.  Others spend a good
deal of time on abstract vector spaces and have you studying (and
possibly even proving) general theorems about them.

Why do they
make you go through Calculus before taking linear algebra?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In the case of the more cookbook courses the answer is probably
'inertia': it's always been done that way.  A decent linear algebra
course, however, requires a bit more mathematical maturity than a
typical freshman calculus course, so it's generally scheduled to
follow calculus.  This isn't so much because you'll use concepts from
calculus (though you might: differentiation is a nice example of a
linear operator) as it is for the additional exposure to mathematical
ideas in general.

What do you mean by 'normal algebra'?
