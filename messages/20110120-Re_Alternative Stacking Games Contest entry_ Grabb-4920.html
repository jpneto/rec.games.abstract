There is
an inherent logic in completing a capture in most games, but  given
the object it is certainly no coincidence that Konane has no such
obligation. I chose to refrain from it even before I checked and found
that, indeed, ancient Hawaiian Polynesians had reached the same
conclusion.

There's another aspect to consider here. In Grabber there is only one
kind of move: a capture.
Hence 'making a move' and 'making a capture' are identical and
terminating a capture at a certain square is no different from
terminating a move at a certain square.
In every Chess game, including MQ, pieces terminate moves at certain
squares. They're not obliged to 'go all the way' (although this might
be a thought to wrap a game around).
No, they say "I finished my move. Your turn", which is, according to
your reasoning, 'an aesthetic Hiroshima'.
Here we disagree.
