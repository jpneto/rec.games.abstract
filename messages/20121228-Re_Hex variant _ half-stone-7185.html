Luis, it goes without saying that once you've morphed a tessellation into a honeycomb pattern (which must be possible in this case according to Mark's theorem), you have to then cut a board with the correct orientation.  The correct order is to morph then cut.  Trivial.  Nobody, other than you, was insisting on any particular, pre-determined board orientation.

So yes, you're "right" that you compounded your own folly with this improperly rotated, dual grid nonsense.  There's only one way for you to save face here, Luis.  Repeat the famous words of Homer Simpson.  "DOH!"



neither a game on the board I drew nor a game on a 45º rotation of it, which are the most natural ways to cut an infinite "yellow grid", are equivalent to Hex games.

This is a crucial distinction. It all depends on how the board is morphed and cut:

If those were infinite boards, they would be equivalent, but the precise ways in which the infinite grid is morphed and cut makes for different games.



There's more to this than I thought indeed. Interesting discussion. :)
