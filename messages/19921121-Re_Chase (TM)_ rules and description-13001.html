Chase (TM) is a chess-like game played on a hexagonal board, using two
colours of six-sided dice for men.  The range of mobility of the men is
defined by the value on each die, and certain moves allow you to change
those values during the game.  Thus the nature of the playing pieces may
vary, and this must be taken into account when computing moves and
strategies.

This reminds me of another "board + dice" type game, where the values
on the dice represent mobility.  Basic description and rules follow,
but I can't give the exact setup or size because this is from memory
of playing the game only once or twice.

Game is played on an (8x8) square board.  Each player gets (8) pieces
that are setup along his back rank with different values showing on
the top sides (depending on position) and specific values showing on
the front (or back) sides, thus fully determining orientation.  (This
is important.)

Pieces are moved by 'rolling' them along the board, such that in moving
one square, the piece will also rotate 90 degrees, putting a new face
on top.  So if a piece starts with the 1 on top, and the 4 facing
you and you move it 1 square away from yourself, it will finish
with the 4 on top and the 6 facing you.  (They are proper dice in that
opposite faces add to 7.)

A piece may be moved as many squares as the number on top of the
piece at the start of its movement, and may change direction at will
as long as it never reverses it travel.  Ie a piece with a 5 on top
could travel: forward, right, right, forward, right; or f, f, f, r, r;
or b, r, r, b, b; or l, b, l, b, b; but not: b, r, r, f, r; or:
f, r, f, l, f.

A piece captures another piece if it lands on the other piece at the
end of its movement -- ie it has to land exactly.

There is (also) one special piece with only ones on it; effectively a
'king'.

The winner is the first person to eliminate the opponents king.

The game is interesting in that the mobility, and hence, strength
of the pieces varies depending on what path they take; and two 
different paths to the same square can give different values for
the piece.
