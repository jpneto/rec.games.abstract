Subject: Re: SPROUTS

I have been interested in SPROUTS theory for around 6 or 7 years.
By trial and error (no formal proof as yet) I realized that the player
number, number of starting 'dots' (nodes?), and 'ends' (dots which cannot be
connected any more) are linked:

   P + D = E      for the winner

   where P is the player number (1 for first, 0 for second)
	 D is the starting dots
	 E is the ends.
   all three are parities, ie if there is one more dot than before,
   the same player needs to get the opposite parity of ends to win.

Another interesting aspect of sprouts is who has a forcable win. The game
has simple enough rules that it should be fairly easy to show who can
win for the first few numbers of starting dots (NOSD). Obviously one player 
must be able to force a win for each NOSD, as no draws are possible and
there are only two players with no random element.
I once found the first few forced wins (~6 or 7) by simply playing the same
NOSD game many times.
   If you consider this article interesting enough, feel free to post it.
