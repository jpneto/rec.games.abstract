<br>&nbsp;i just received a game from the flea market world
<br>&nbsp;called Trippples[tm].&nbsp; this game came out in 1972 and
<br>&nbsp;features a changeable board over which 2 pieces move.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;each piece (a circle or a square) moves according to
<br>&nbsp;the board tile trhat the other piece is sitting on.
<br>&nbsp;so your legal moves are determined by <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>where<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the
<br>&nbsp;other piece is.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there are 8 ways to leave a board square and each piece
<br>&nbsp;has either a blank (4) or a graph symbol showing three
<br>&nbsp;ways to leave the square (56) and then the start &amp; finish
<br>&nbsp;corners (4).
