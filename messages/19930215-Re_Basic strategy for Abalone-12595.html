I'm in the process of writing a game of Abalone for a programming contest.
The big problem is that nobody here really knows how to play.  I would
be very thankful to anybody who could bring little pieces of strategy
information about the game.
The only thing I have pickup by playing a couple games is: keep your stones
together, and stay away from the edge!  I'm sure there's a lot more to it.

	There is some kind of strategy to be looked for in the "divide
and conquer" area.  If you're in a position where you are in trouble
and just need to defend for a bit, the best thing you can do is
cluster, and avoid having "appendages" to your main body of pieces.

	It's a little more vague when you are on the offensive.
Splitting up your opponent's group into subgroups works, but only in
certain situations.  I haven't been able to define that situation well
(and I haven't played in a couple years), but it may be something you
might want to look at.
