Terrace is played on a 8x8 board.  However, the board is raised in terraces
to two corners. 

8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
7 7 6 5 4 3 2 2
6 6 6 5 4 3 3 3
5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4     1 being lowest  and  8 highest
4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5
3 3 3 4 5 6 6 6
2 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The playing pieces are sets of semi-spheres of four different sizes.  One of
the smallest size pieces has a "T" on top of it.

OBJECT: To capture your opponents' "T" or to move your own "T" to the lowest
        square acrossed the board

MOVEMENT:

  On the Same Level: In a single move you can move your piece to any open
                     square on the same level as long as you do not jump
		     over an opponents piece.  You also may not cross the
		     gap between the two terraces on the 4th level.

  Moving Up: You can move up one level to any square diagonal or straight from
	     your position.

  Moving Down: You can move down one level STRAIGHT ONLY from your position.

  Capturing: You can capture any pieces that is the smae size or smaller by
	     moving DOWN DIAGONALLY ONLY.  The captured piece is then removed.
             You may capture your own piece.  It is customary to say "Terrace"
	     when you put your opponents "T" in jeopardy of being captured or
	     "Terrace-mate" when the opponents "T" has no means of avoiding
	     capture.


NOTATION:
Pieces: size: 1-4 and T where 1 and T are smallest and 4 is Largest
       color: White=W, Black=B, Blue=U, Red=R
       board: with the low corner in the bottom left and upper right

Game play begins with white then turns rotate clockwise.

As you can tell the game is not over run by rules.  On the contrary, there is
a shortage of them, especially for the four player version.  If there is
interest I will post Rules and Adaptations I have come up with to deal with
certain situations.  Again, I would be interested in an E-mail game with
someone or three.
