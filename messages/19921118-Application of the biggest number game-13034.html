(What happened to #3 up there??)



The telephone company should propose that which ever customer has the highest
telephone bill that month doesn't have to pay anything.

There are lots of ways of getting very high telephone bills to participate in
this type of contest: rent 15 phone lines, get call-waiting, rent a lot
of telephones, have people in Japan call you collect and talk for the whole
month, etc.  Of course if you do this and you miss the highest by a couple
of dollars you may not enjoy the next time you get your phone bill.
