To be self-consistent I will continue, perhaps perversely,
to let Even choose the row and win when an even number
of cells is occupied at game's end.

Whenever Odd has as many columns to choose from
as Even has rows, Odd wins with a simple strategy.
For example, on the 7x7 board he plays
   1,1,2,1,3,1,4,1,5,1,6,1,7,1
     *   *   *   *   *   *   *
Odd will win, at one of the turns marked *.

Whenever Even has more rows to choose from
than Odd has columns, he wins with a simple strategy.
For example, on the 6x7 board he plays
    1,2,1,3,1,4,1,5,1,6,1,7,1
        *   *   *   *   *   *
Even will win, at one of the turns marked *.

Despite this simplicity, I did write a general
solver for the game.  The main driver is trivial
(at least if one doesn't bother detecting
equivalence symmetries).  The real work is the
game matrix solver, but I just borrowed the one
recently linked to by Chip Eastham, translating
it to C.  (My Javascript knowledge was near zero,
but I persevered.   :-)  )

Although they won't arise when Even or Odd
adopts the optimal strategy mentioned above,
subpositions can arise with complex strategies.
For example, consider this position:

     X X . .
     X . X X
     X . X X
     . . X .
     . X . X

Here, Even's optimal mixed strategy is
   0.255 / 0.093 / 0.093 / 0.303 / 0.255.
Odd's optimal mixed strategy is
   0.076 / 0.409 / 0.440 / 0.076.
Even wins here with probability .4086.
