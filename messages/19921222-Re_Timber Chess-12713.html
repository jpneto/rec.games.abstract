I vehemently deny that the ko rule is a defect. Without it, a "ko fight"
would consist of hour upon hour of replaying the exact same moves over
and over until one of the players got bored, tired, or fell over dead.
All the ko rule states is that a move which exactly recreates a previous
position is illegal... is that wrong? Do you also disagree with the
"three repetitions and a draw" rule of chess?

some "defects" in some games have absolutely no
function otherwise, such as "en-passant" pawn capture - now how in- what
was the circumstance that led to that rule??  i'd like to go back in time
and see where they came up with that one...:-))

It dates back to the time when pawns weren't allowed to move forward two
spaces on their first move. When they allowed the pawn to move forward
two spaces on its first move, they didn't allow it to escape a threatened
capture by an enemy pawn that way, by allowing the enemy pawn to capture
as if the pawn had only moved one square.
