I have a customer asking about a game they played at a Renaissaance fair
called "tevor," or "Trevor", they weren't sure of the name. Does this sound
familiar to anyone? He's their description:

I will try to describe the best I can.  The
game board (which was a real wood board) had octagons printed on the face. 
The game pieces were made of wood also,  there were three shapes a square,
a triangle, and a circle, Each shape had a choice of color red, green or
yellow. and a choice of size,  small, medium, tall.  You played by choosing
a piece and handing it to your opponent he then had the choice to put it
anywhere on any unoccupied octagon on the board.  The player won by having
three pieces of the same likeness grouped together on the octagon board. 
Ex.  Three small yellow square blocks, or three tall blocks so either by
shape or color they were similar.  Well that is all I can remember thanks
again for the help.
