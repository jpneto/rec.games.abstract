Well, a base 4 hex hex board is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> too big for Rive, at least for
beginners.  I don't think anyone has ever completed a base 5 game of Rive,
though some, including myself, have tried.

The churn, or the rate of capturing and recycling stones, is so fucking huge
in Rive that it makes the churns of Hex Oust and Tanbo, the previous churn
masters, look as crappy as Go in comparison.

Rive test play data:
3x3x3 19 cells, 24 moves, churn=130%
3x3x4 29 cells, 80 moves, churn=270%
4x4x4 37 cells, 129 moves, churn=350%  OMG!!!!

(Churn can usually be represented with a single digit, like Go.)

Rive gameplay is strangely similar to Cephalopod, a dice game, in many ways.
 I think Corey was the first to make that observation, though he was talking
about the capturing-from-within aspect, not the massive churn that both
games also share.  I commented at the time that I think there might be a
link.  Capturing from within <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>creates<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> huge churn.

Cephalopod rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cephalopod_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Cephalopod_rules.pdf</a>

The magnitude of Cephalopod's churn (560%) has been attributed to its six
sided dice.  But how do we now account for Rive, a simple stone placement
game with a churn approaching that of Cephalopod?

It's fun to watch the Rive mechanism at work, but, for example, I was
completely annihilated a few different times - in one game!  And I ended up
losing.  It was clear though that one could conceivably come back from a
couple of total wipeouts and still win.  Just didn't happen in my case   :)
Remember, this is a naturally finite game.  No superko.

Rive's architecture is particularly satisfying.  I had come to believe that
there was kind of an upper limit on how much game tree you could wring out
of a board, some stones, and a naturally finite game.  And I still believe
that, though the limit is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>much<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> higher than I ever imagined it to be.

How far can a game go without being infinite?  Rive.
