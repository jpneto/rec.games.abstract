After all that bellowing by Bill Taylor and Corey Clark, you're blaming me
for killing productive discussion?  Wow.  Believe it or not I was trying to
promote productive discussion by inviting Christian Freeling here.  A lot of
good that did.

You're right Nick, and I wish I had a solution.  It's hard to mellow myself
out when I'm constantly bombarded with stupid shit.  Granted it's not all
defensive on my part.  Case in point, the "great mind" chicanery used to
goad Bill Taylor.  But make a counter-goad or something.  Don't show up
after being essentially absent for years and start bellowing for days on
end.  What an ass!

If you recall, I said it's my fault Bill Taylor is rampaging, thinking the
rampage would blow over, and I apologized.  The counter spam plot occurred
to me early on but I didn't want to be a total dick about it.  But then the
Taylor tantrum wasn't blowing over.  It was just day after day of more
bellowing spam.  It got to the point of "If I see that bellowing spam one
more time..." and then it was like "Woop, there it is."

Bill Taylor has made a career of overstepping his bounds.  When he dies, his
fat grave will certainly jut into a neighboring plot.
