Indeed!  And this has seeingly been festering in the back of your mind
for some time!  Or perhaps you've just been editing through some old files?

Anyway, it seems that this grain of irritation has produced a little pearl!  :)

|&gt; that the infinite series 1+2+3+4+... summed to -1/12. 

Yes; the Zeeman's Rita approach was what prompted my enquiry, which came
in a thread on how   1 + 2 + 4 + 8 +...  summed to 1.  My BS observation
was that if you added 1 to the LHE of the series, then it "obviously"
accumulated up and swept away all the terms to 0 by telescoping cancellation.

And I wondered if the same could be done with the above.

I liked whatsiname's reply that the Abel and Cesaro sums of 1 - 2 + 3 - 4...
both came to 1/4.  He gave the Abel derivation; very simple it is.  I checked
the Cesaro sum on paper, and grubbed out the same answer.   (Cesaro is always
a mess!)  It's fun to see they're the same.  No doubt various other divergent
summabilkity methods give the same as well.  I have a colleague who specializes
in this, I'll have to ask him.

Anyway, given that  1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 -...  sums to  1/4, we can get the above
result very simply without the further reference to zetas that were made before...

S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +...

  = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 +...   + 2 (2 + 4 + 6 +...)

  = - 1/4  +  4 (1 + 2 + 3 +...)   = - 1/4 + 4 S

therefore   S = - 1/12.      Ta-Dah!(BS)          Not half bad eh?


|&gt; Now, let's add up S + 2S + S -4S -8S -4S = -12S, but
|&gt; choosing a very special formatting:

That's very nice Daryl!   Thanks.   
Now we already know from above that  S = - H/3    where

S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +...   and
H = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 +...   ;     so now we can get H by your methods, viz

4 H = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 +...
        + 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 -...
        + 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 -...
            + 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 +...
    = 1   with all this other junk miraculaously telescoping away!

So we get all of the above, by the most beautiful BS.

But a BS that can be justified by various divergent-summability methods OC.

--------

There is a very slight application to all this!

It is a triviality that the usual method of playing games where there
is an obvious first-move advantage, is unfair to the second player. "First"
is clearly an average of half a move ahead of "Second", e.g. at random times.
A typical attempted rectification of this, in abstract-game-playing circles,
is the 1 2 2 2 2 ...  move transformer, whereby after the first move, each
player plays two moves consecutively.  Though inappropriate for most games
if used directly, it may have its uses if some further restrictions are added.

It has the Cesaro-propery of "evening-out" the starting advantage, (though 
for VERY short games a further integration to 1 3 4 4 4 4 may be suitable),
and it is nice to see the sum of 1-2+2-... coming to 0 by almost every method.


Now, another move transformer often used is the "Progressive" transformer,
whereby the moves are taken in series of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.  It makes for
fun games, if hardly very serious ones; and e.g. Progressive Chess already
has quite a long history.

But it often struck me that even so, there was a very slight advantage to First.
(e.g. His number of moves ahead is successively 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3... so that First 
is always first to get to a new number of moves ahead, rather than Second.)
And so it now appears this advantage is real!  There is an advantage to 1/4
of a move to First!!!   Horrors!   This must not be!!

So one way I have considered for some while of rectifying the Progressive
transformer was to make it an "Odd-Progressive" transformer.  This has move
series of 1, 3, 5, 7... , which gives the number of moves First is ahead
each time as being  1 -2 3 -4... , which is clearly fairer than the above.

And what do we see?   The above methods give that
 
       1 - 3 + 5 - 7 + 9 -   = 0    EXACTLY!

What a triumph!   

The Odd Progressive transformer is the answer to young Sagme Trabsact's prayer!!

(P.S.  exercise for the reader to verify the vanishing of the last series)
