 From Pickover's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Computers and the Imagination<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, p. 355f, this is a fairly
simple game but apparently there is no known strategy.  These rules are for
the more colorful "native" game, but one can readily modify them for the
civilized crowd.  Two (I don't see why not more than two) play:

1.  Obtain a large stick.

2.  Using the stick, sketch a 5 by 6 cell array in nearby sand or dirt.
    Set the stick aside, but keep it handy for future games.  :-)

3.  The first player places an old skull in any of the free (empty) cells.
    It is assumed there is a sufficiently large pile of available skulls.

4.  Play alternates, where each player takes a skull and places it in an
    empty cell, subject to the proviso that:

    (a) The skull is placed adjacent to a previously placed skull, in the
        orthogonal (i.e., not diagonal) sense,

    (b) All skulls played form one continuous connected path through the board,

    (c) The path neither forms nor contains a closed loop.

5.  The player who is unable to play according to the rules is the loser.

6.  The loser donates his head to the collection of skulls.

Here is a sample "lost" position, "O" representing skulls played:

	O . O O O .
	O . . . O .
	O O O . O O
	. . O . . O
	. . O O O O
