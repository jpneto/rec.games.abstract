Nice aesthetics  :)

After playing a few times I noticed that there are 2 hexagons which

There will be "anomalies" (in my version), especially along the

In my last game I noticed that they seem to be worth
less than a normal move, giving the board different terrains.  I tried
evening it out with this board:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=18pkVoKAUXtmG1u49DJ7hBDZUphU">https://docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=18pkVoKAUXtmG1u49DJ7hBDZUphU</a>...

Molar Fractal?  :)

I'd like to play "normal" Fractal, but I can't seem to get the
technology together.

I think Fractal is an interesting experiment in connection games.  I
imagine it could even start a genre of Fractal hex games.

No objections  :)   Instead of one central snowflake, you could have
seven smaller snowflakes - a central one surrounded by six others,
etc.  Just thinking out loud.  There might not be room for all that.

In fact it might be interesting to purposely make stronger and weaker
points and somehow exploit that in the rules or general mechanics.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

While it's possible to create more evenly distributed cell values, as
Cubist has demonstrated, you wouldn't want to aim in the opposite
direction, going out of your way to create stronger and weaker cells.
For example, if there were six equally valued strong cells, we'd take
turns snapping them up and end up with a smaller game.  If there were
three equally valued strong cells, this would present a move order
advantage problem.  Outstanding cells are something to avoid in board
design, especially a single (way) outstanding center cell.

I do recommend using the pie rule with Fractal.  Why not?  It's a
completely independent rule that can be used with any game, and if
it's discovered to be unnecessary with Fractal, Player 2 always has
the option not to invoke it.  I've come to think of the pie rule as a
friend, though an ugly one.
