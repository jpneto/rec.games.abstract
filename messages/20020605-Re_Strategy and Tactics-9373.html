The quote in context is as follows.

"Consider one difference in how Kasparov and Deep Thought/Deep Blue
play chess.  In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov
by sacrificing a piece. [current] Computer programs are not supposed
to be able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-
mordem analysis, Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed
all possible variations at least up to the point where the computer
regained the sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice
the piece for strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones."

You can replace the sentence

"[current] Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons."

A fine line. The evaluation function for determining the value
of a position during a minmax search usually includes strategic
considerations. In the case of chess this is a dead certainty,
if the computer is going to play with any strength at all. There
isn't enough time or space available to a current computer to
make move decisions on tactical analysis alone.
