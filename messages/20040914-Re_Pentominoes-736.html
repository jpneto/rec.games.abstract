<br>Here's one 8x8 variation I came up with which I think adds a bit of

diagrams, so I'll put it on my web site in due course and will post an 
announcement when it's done. (Won't be for a while yet.)

<br>&nbsp; Your line length is about half again as long as it should be, by the 
way.&nbsp; Please try to stick to 70--75 columns on Usenet.

<br><blockquote type=cite>Whenever you place a pentomino on the board so that it lies edge to edge 
with a previously placed piece, a certain number of its constituent 
squares will abut those of another piece.&nbsp; For example, if you place the 
I piece lengthwise against the top bar of the T it will abut three such 
squares. So you score three points for doing so. Following the same 
principle, each in turn places a piece on the board and scores 1 point 
for each of its squares which abuts a square of any and all adjacent 
pieces. The winner is the player with the greatest total when no more 
pieces can be played, a typical score being about 32 (perhaps not 
surprisingly). The first player scores zero on the first turn, of 
course.

<br>I suppose this version might be called Pointominoes...

<br>&nbsp; The "how many sides abut?" variation theme is apparently a common
<br>one! :)&nbsp; My favorite pentominoes game is the following one, which
<br>I invented (so no wonder it's my favorite, huh?):

<br>&nbsp; (Except that within a month of posting that message I decided that
<br>a 6-by-6 board played a lot better than a 7-by-7.)
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Looking again, I see that your variant counts the number of <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>squares<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>, 
rather than the number of <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>sides<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>, which are abutting on a new piece.
<br>That's interesting.&nbsp; I'll definitely try out this new game when I get a 
chance.
