Bad terminology:

trivial you would call a game with a unique win, that is, every move of
the second player is forced to avoid immediate loss, but first player wins.

A mathematician would call a play trivial presumably if there is one
square, so that even the first move is a forced one and decides the game.

solvable does mean that the maximum gain for both players is fixed, that
is, if the best player 1 can reach under all countermoves of his opponent,
the opponent can not do better than a draw in turn. If someone can win
for all reactions of his opponent, the opponent has a losing situation.

A play is solvable, if you can determine beforehand if the initial
situation is a win, draw, or loss.

All TicTacToe variants have a finite number of possible moves on a finite
board and are thus solvable. There exists a finite algorithm (backtracking
all possible moves, guaranteed less than N! possibilities) for any
variant. REASONABLE solvability is a different piece of cake though.
