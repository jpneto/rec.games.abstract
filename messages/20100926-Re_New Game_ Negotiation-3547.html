:)  We can get a little carried away with our inventions.  Sometimes
designers are right to be enthusiastic about their new game and
sometimes they're wrong not to be, etc.  There's no shortage of bias
in gaming.  When you win a game your first time playing, you'll have a
much better opinion of it than if you lose.  I generally never ask
people their opinion of a new game.  There'd be no point asking the
rec.games.abstract readership what they think of my game, for
example.  If they don't like it, there's nothing I can do generally.
I purposely make my games fundamental. So there's no way to change
them without completely going back to the drawing board.  I'd rather
just try to learn from past experiences and incorporate that knowledge
into my next, radically different design.
