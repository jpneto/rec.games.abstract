I'm going to London during the first week in November; and I'd like to 
receive information regarding abstract board games.  What new abstract 
board games have been published in the United Kingdom or Germany in the 
last 5 years...?  Is the Games Centre still operating at 16 Hanway 
Street?  Are there any game magazines currently published on par with the 
defunct "Games &amp; Puzzles" and "Gamer" magazines?  Have any new games been 
invented in the last 10 year by Eric Solomon, David Wells, David 
Pritchard, or David Parlett?

During the 1970s and early 80s, I subscribed to "Games and Puzzles" and 
purchased many games thru the mail.  However, it's been about 10 years 
since I have received anything.  Thanks in advance!
