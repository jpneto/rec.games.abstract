It doesn't, agreed, but it does at least tell just about anyone what's
going on at the tournament.

You can call the winner the Grand Vizier of Chatrang or anything else
you want, but the first job, or so ISTM, is to get people through the
door with a term that is both descriptive and doesn't require research
to understand.

Ok, there can be a different name for the tournament play that is more
descriptive, that someone else can come up with, if need be.  The
major issue of the document is whether or not the categories work as a
taxonomy system, more than the name.  The name is the least of the
concerns.

However, not sure Grand Vizier of Chatrang is going to work either, as
that will cause the person unfamilar with chess and variants to wonder
what the heck you are talking about also.  Actually if you ask a
normal person what they think a chess variant is, they were probably
say something like "checkers?".  It may be best to have a name that
works and sounds professional, that people have to find out what the
heck it is about anyway.
