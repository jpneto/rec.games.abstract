    Not sure which accusations you're referring to...  I haven't seen any
stupid accusations in this thread.  As long as you're going to waste time
responding, you might as well tell us exactly what you're responding to.
With regard to the one accusation i have seen here (namely poor
sportsmanship), most of what you've written is irrelevant to that issue.
The additional info is welcome anyway.

Normal World Championship matches are 40
games in 11 days (average of 3.6 games a day).  This match is 30 games in
11 days (2.7 games a day).  Tinsley is delighted with the playing conditions

    Tinsley's a real champ.  Nevertheless, IMO conditions still favor
the machine.  Because in a normal human/human match, both contestants are
subject to fatigue; whereas in a human/machine match, only the human is.
You've reduced the avg number of games by almost 1 per day to compensate,
but that's still about 3 games a day for 2 weeks.  How can you be so sure
fatigue will not be a factor such a pace?

    This is the umpteenth time you've said it.  If as you've said in
various posts:

    BTW thanks for posting some info about Tinsley's state.
Hope he recovers.
