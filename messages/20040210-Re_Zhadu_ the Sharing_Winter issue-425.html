  Just a quick note to say that I have been playing Zhadu by email
with R.A. Frederickson, and I share his opinion that it really is
a good abstract game.  Zhadu is definitely a game that you can
learn in a minute, and it takes <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>at least<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> 1/840 of a lifetime to
master. ;-)

  The game rules can be found here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zhadu.com/webZhaduGuide.pdf">http://www.zhadu.com/webZhaduGuide.pdf</a>

  Some of the good things about the game: It revolves around a
board with lots of connections, laid out so as to make movement
fairly intuitive while keeping the board "open," so to speak.
The five pieces are of different abilities, but they are easy to
keep straight, because (at one level) their powers differ only in
the number of spaces they can move per turn.  (At another level,
the pieces are very different; they cast different "shadows" on
the board, meaning that sometimes a 1 stone can reach places that
a 2 stone can't, or vice versa.)
  There also seems to be a good balance between the importance of
the initial placement phase and the "game proper," the movement
phase.  Bad placement can hurt, but placement doesn't dominate the
game.

  Anyway, Zhadu is really a good game, and quite addictive.  I
recommend it.  (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zhadu.com/">http://www.zhadu.com/</a>, but be prepared for a
mildly annoying Flash intro.  See the rules, linked to above.)
