[This post was made by Octi creator Don Green to the Octi club at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/octiclub">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/octiclub</a> . Here you can also find other
information and discussions about Octi, particularly some Octi puzzles. I
was asked to repost this here.]

In honor of the Yahoo! Octi club's upcoming first anniversary, GATCO will
sponsor a virtual Octi tournament.

There will be two categories, fast game and full game. Prizes will be a free
game of Octi and a trophy for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place finishers in each
category.

We'll play a round-robin, and after everyone has played everyone else, we'll
have a semi-final and final game.

Since we're all in different time zones, I propose that we let each pair of
opponents decide whether they would like to play in person, on-line, or by
email.

If you would like to play, let me know (either here on by email at
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:octimon@yahoo.com">octimon@yahoo.com</a>), and I'll sign you up. The timing of the tournament is
flexible, but I expect to start Friday, March 23.

Let me know if you have comments or suggestions about the tournament.

Cheers,
Don
