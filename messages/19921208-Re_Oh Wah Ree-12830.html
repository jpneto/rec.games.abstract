Hi.  My roommate has a game called Oh Wah Ree.  It has twelve pots
arranged in a circle, and lots of little stones.  It also has some
(maybe four) other holes in the middle.  She used to enjoy it years
ago, but can't remember how it's played, and doesn't have the rules.
She would also love to hear about the origins and history of the
game.  Any information on either of these aspects would by highly
appreciated.

Your girlfriend has a game that everyone else knows as Awari! It is a
game of african origin where it is played extensively in the western
sub-saharan area.  A similar game is played elsewhere called Kalah (and

I agree up to here. From there, the rules we play with differ.
This does not mean either of us is right, since their are some 1200
variations of the class of Mancala games, all different.

The Awari rules as I will describe them are used at the Computer Olympiads
(a yearly event).

So, continuining point (3) above:

(3) ... If the last stone is dropped in a pit on the side of the enemy,
    and it contains, including the just dropped stone, exactly 2 or 3
    stones, these stones are captured. If a move is a capture move,
    you go back to the pit you dropped your next-to-last stone in. If
    this also contains 2 or 3 stones, and is also an enemey pit, these
    stones are also captured.
    Capturing stops, as soon as a pit is encountered with a number of
    stones less than 2 or more than 3, or when you reach your own pits.

(4) The winner is the player who captures 25 stones or more.

(5) If a player cannot move, the opponent captures the remaining stones
    on the board.

(6) If the position is repeated, the remaining stones are evenly split
    between the players.

(7) To ensure that a player will not prematurely run out of moves, the
    opponent is forced to choose a move, which will ensure that the player
    can make a move after the opponent has moved. Thus, you are forced
    to do a 1-ply lookahead to see if your opponent can move afterwards.
    If all your moves lead to a position where your opponent cannot move,
    he just has bad luck (or you played well), and you can choose
    any move you like (each leading to you capturing all stones).


If there are any Awari players out there who play according to these rules,
please let me know.

Victor Allis.
