A new study links psychopathy to academic cheating.  It seems to apply
to game cheating as well, at least in principle, thus revealing a
commonality between Corey Clark (psychopath) and Frank Groeneveld
(cheater).

"Psychologists at the University of British Columbia found that
students who cheated in high school and college were likely to meet
the criteria for psychopathic personality - the type that tends toward
a range of bad behaviors, like alcohol and drug abuse, bullying and
reckless driving. It's the same impulsive, callous and antisocial
personality that characterizes criminal psychopaths, though, to be
fair, student cheaters scored a lot lower on psychopathy
questionnaires than actual criminal offenders.

The researchers found that academic cheaters also scored high in two
other personality traits: narcissism (people who suffer from
grandiosity, self-centeredness and an outsized sense of entitlement)
and Machiavellianism (cynical, amoral types who make it a habit to
manipulate others). But of the three disordered personalities -
together known colorfully as the Dark Triad - psychopathy was the only
trait significantly associated with student cheating."

Wow Mark, you're really connecting the dots here. I take it you watch
a lot of Glenn Beck.
