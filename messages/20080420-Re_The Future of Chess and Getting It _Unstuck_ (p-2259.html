Which reminds me...

Given that China's Chang Hao defeated Japan's best players, and then
South Korea's Lee Chang Ho defeated Chang Hao, it may be that some in
Japan felt that bringing about a resurgence in the popularity of Go
there, in order that stronger players might arise from a larger field,
was a matter of national honor.

Look at the adulation received by Robert J. Fischer, or by Van
Cliburn. What if the Russians, or even another country not perceived
as hostile - such as Japan - had the world's top baseball team?
