Help me out here, Christian.  You were a high school teacher.  There had to be that occasional lost looking loner (giving you a boner) with a butt you could bounce a dime off.  You probably had to strap your giant dick to your leg with a belt.  I wish I still had that pic of Christian in a speedo.  He just about put Martin Spellbinder to shame.
