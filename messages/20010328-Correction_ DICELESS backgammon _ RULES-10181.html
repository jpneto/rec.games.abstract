Hello Gamers,

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


Oops, this has to be "diceless" (!) Narde, of course.


For those of you who are still interested in playing games, I give you the
rules of Nardy bez Kostey as explained to me  by my Russian friends:

The rules are equal to Nardy (in English: "Narde")

--&gt; <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.vogclub.com/rules.phtml?sid=7&amp;gtype=2">http://www.vogclub.com/rules.phtml?sid=7&amp;gtype=2</a>

-- BUT with the following differences:

(1) no "real" dices are used
(2) two "dice values" are chosen by the players and announced loudly
    -- however --
    - (2.1) one of the "dice values" should always be one, but there is
            one exception:
    - (2.2) one can call one doubles per game

I would suggest to use Bodlaenders diceless checkgammon rule:

"If both players bear off their last piece on the same move number, the
game is a draw."

Nardy bez Kostey is said to be very popular in Azerbajdzhan
and Uzbekistan. The game was invented by backgammon players in Baku in the
1970s. There are tournaments played with chess clocks. Some claim the game
is "intriguing", "almost like playing Chess".


REQUEST:

Please test this game and tell me what you think about it (strategy?,
tactics?).
