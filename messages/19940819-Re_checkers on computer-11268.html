	I have heard that while some very good chess programs have been
written for computers up to the Grandmaster level, no one has been able to 
write a program that enables a computer to play at such a level. The
implication being that checkers is far more difficult at the professional
level than is chess. Has anyone else heard of this?

Positively not. The two best checkers players in the world, by common
agreement, are one human (Dr. Tinsley) who has been world champ. for
years and Chinook, a computer program. They are currently playing a
series of matches in a competition sponsored by Silicon Graphics.

Possibly you're thinking of Go, which computers still cannot play
well.
