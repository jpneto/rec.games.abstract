A friend at work was watching a movie (Santa Claus I think ) and she saw
one of the characters playing a game. I have included a screen dump of the
game at:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.anotherday.me.uk/f2s/stuff/game.jpg">http://www.anotherday.me.uk/f2s/stuff/game.jpg</a>

Now my colleague has asked me if I can remember the game and whether it is
still possible to get it. Unfortunately, although I can remember seeing the
game many years ago, I cannot remember the name of it and have tried a
description of it in Google but without much success.

Is there anyone here who remembers the game and what it was called or even
who made it?

Many thanks

Michael
