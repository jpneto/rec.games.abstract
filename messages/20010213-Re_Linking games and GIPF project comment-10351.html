I am interested in finding out about any sort of games that
involve the "linking" of several independent games.

... In the GIPF project the
two games Tamsk and Zertz, in addition to being independent games, are
more like "subroutines" to the main game Gipf. ...

Well, this is probably more along the lines of one game being a
'subroutine', but I used to enjoy playing "Fooschess".  Whoever scores a
goal on the foosball table gets to make the next move on a chess board.
There is no check or mate-- capturing the king wins the game.  We had a
twenty second limit on the chess move (at which point the ball gets served
on the foosball table, and if you aren't back to the table, you're very
likely to get scored upon).

Of course, this is no longer an abstract game.  But it becomes closer to one
if you have two very evenly matched foosball players.  Then who moves next
is about the same as a coin flip, and you have some interesting
probabilisitic strategies (ok, still not truly abstract by the definitions
I've seen here, but interesting to some anyway).

P.S.  Foosgammon doesn't play as well.  There are times in backgammon when
neither player would want to move if they had the choice not to.  So this
basically becomes misere foosball, to see who could put the ball in their
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>own<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> goal first.

P.P.S. Nor was Foos-tac-toe (a.k.a. Foos and Crosses) very interesting.  At
least not on a 3x3 board.
