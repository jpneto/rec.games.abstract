lol, cool   I love it.

I took a few flute classes in college and the sax is much more satisfying. 
Just holding a low B flat on the tenor sax and making everything in the
room, including your head, vibrate.  Very satisfying.  The flute doesn't
give you that.

I've always liked the sax.  I don't know.  Maybe I thought it was too loud
and I was worried about the neighbors hearing it.  Now I've finally reached
an age where I don't care if the neighbors hear it.  Better late than never
I suppose.

With the flute, I initially taught myself and played by ear, solo.  But I
shifted everything into the keys of C or G to make it easier and thus
developed "blind spots".  This time I'm doing it the right way, practicing
all the major scales, etc.  I want to learn to recognize all the intervals,
knowing how to get from this fingering to that one, and never sound a wrong
note when playing a melody for the first time.  That's the goal anyway.  A
bigger goal is just to keep playing long enough to get good.
