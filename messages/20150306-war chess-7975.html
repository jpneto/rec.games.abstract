Hi, all. I'm a new member and one of my design interests is war chess, a fusion of chess variant and wargame. I've come up with a decent design that I'm calling Command and Maneuver which needs a few more scenarios. It's a structured multimove abstract strategy wargame construction kit, and the best playtested scenario is The Battle of Macysburg, a riff on the battle of Gettysburg. There is an introductory scenario called A Tale of Two Countries which gives one a basic idea of how the games work, but it doesn't fly like Macysburg does. I've started working on a large version of Tale, a campaign game, but it needs playtesters. These games are a little outside the norm for abstracts and somewhat high end. Since I'm brand new here, I don't know what sort of organization you have for running playtests or game development. I will offer reciprocal playtesting. The games are available as print and play, and also on VASSAL. Now, how do I snag peoples' interest?
