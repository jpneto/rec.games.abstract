Definition of combinatorial game, taken from "Lessons in Play, An
Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory" by Michael Albert, Richard
Nowakowski and David Wolfe:

========
In a combinatorial game there are two players who take turns moving
alternately.  Play continues until the player whose turn it is to move has
no legal moves available.  No chance devices such as dice, spinners, or card
deals are involved, and each player is aware of all the details of the game
position (or game state) at all times.  In this text, the rules of each game
we study will ensure that it will end after a finite sequence of moves, and
the winner is often determined on the basis of who made the last move. 
Under normal play the last player to move wins.  In misere play the last
player loses.

In fact, combinatorial game theory can be used to analyze some games that do
not quite fit the above description.  For instance, in Dots and Boxes,
players may make two moves in a row.  Most Checkers positions are loopy...
========

I propose using the above as a working definition of combinatorial games
here at rec.games.abstract, including the "In this text..." part.  Unless
anyone prefers the bgg definition of combinatorial game:

========
Like abstract and shit.

A couple of representative MSG combinatorial games:

1. Colonnade (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Colonnade_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Colonnade_rules.pdf</a>)
  Combinatorial games are so simple that their gameplay is usually stupid,
  i.e. quick and dirty.  That being said, Colonnade is a fun little game.

2. Jostle (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Jostle_Go_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Jostle_Go_rules.pdf</a>)
  I almost called this one Fuel, because the initial setup seems to have
  energy that's released through play.  Maybe all combinatorials have this
  effect to some degree, but it's more pronounced in Jostle.

3. Tanbo (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Tanbo_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Tanbo_rules.pdf</a>)
  I invented Tanbo 17 years ago before I knew what a combinatorial was. 
  People love to hate Tanbo and I have no idea why.  How can you hate a
  game?  Especially a fundamental, robust game like Tanbo.  It's only a game
  :)
