My friends and I used to play Cathedral quite a bit, and we too concluded
that it was too easy for the second player to pull out a win.  As I recall,
there was a particularly devastating position for the piece shaped like

	XX
	 XX
	 X

such that no matter where the first player responded, the second player
would be able to carve off a hefty chunk of territory.

We fixed the problem by a slight change to the rules.  Rather than have the
first player put down the cathedral, and the second player then placing his
first piece, etc., we have the first player place a regular piece, and then
the second player places both the cathedral AND one of his own pieces; play
then continues alternating normally.  This seems to make the game much more
balanced.
