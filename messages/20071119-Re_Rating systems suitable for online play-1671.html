I am not a mathematician, so I'm not the right person to develop a
robust graph-based ranking system. But I can give an example of a very
simple one, to give an idea how they might work:

Construct a n * n matrix, where n is the number of players in the
system: One row and one column for each player. The element (i,j) of
the matrix is player i's win ratio against player j (0.5 if they've
never played). Now, (if I remember my linear algebra correctly!!) you
can look upon this as the transition matrix of a markov chain, and by
repeated multiplication of an initial vector by this matrix, you end
up with a vector that is a guess of the player's skills.

There exists very efficient algorithms for calculating such a vector,
so it should scale very well.

Any suggestions? Do you think this is a good idea?

Harald, I will need to study it more.  Your question is one of the
questions trying to be worked out for a championship series in the
IAGO World Tour, used to determine player ranking and so on.  If
people have alternatives to ELO, please let me know.  Please go here
and start a topic on this (as it is relevant to the IAGO World Tour):
