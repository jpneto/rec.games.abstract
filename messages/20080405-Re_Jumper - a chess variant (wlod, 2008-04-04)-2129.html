Do you have a way to check that piece to make
sure that piece works in chess?

[...]  Your jumper piece could be one of those.
That piece does look overpowered though.

You think so? In a separate post I proposed
the very general idea of asymmetric chess
(special cases were known and played for years),
and in particular I have suggested that white
may have queen, whle black has jumper (or vice
versa). Do you think that jumper would have
an advantage?

I was thinking about a weaker version of
jumper, where diagonally it would move like
a bishop 9without the ability of leaping
over pieces) but finally I decided on
simplicity of the rules. Even vertically
and horizontally one could demand that no
piece, which stands on the same color square
obstructs the jumper. Thus we have three
possibilities: jumper (call it super jumper),
vh-jumper (lepsa horizontally and vertically but
diagonally it acts like a bishop) and
weak jumper (it leaps only over the pieces
which stand on the other color squares).

I feel that the super jumper is the most
interesting.

Thank you, best regards,
