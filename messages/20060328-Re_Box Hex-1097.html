Thank you for your clarifications Ed.  David's comments actually did
more good than harm overall.  I plan to make some modifications to my
comments on the Box Hex rule sheet as a result of his observations.
After some reflection I would like to make a concession regarding the
two vs three dimensionality of Box Hex.  If I make a two dimensional
drawing of your car, you won't be able to use that drawing for
transportation.  But a two dimensional morph of Box Hex <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> playable
as a game.  So I guess you could say that the two dimensional versions
are isomorphic to the three dimensional version.

Box Hex started as a three dimensional game.  I know that because I
designed it.  When you make a two dimensional representation of the
three dimensional Box Hex, you lose information.  First you lose the
fact that it started as a three dimensional structure.  Secondly, and
perhaps more relevant, you lose the regular structure.  You no longer
have an evenly distributed, three dimensional honeycomb pattern.
Instead you now have small cells, large cells, and oddly shaped,
stretched cells.  It's a long way from the original, regular, three
dimensional honeycomb pattern.  If the point is that Box Hex can be
played as a two dimensional game, point granted.  Does that make it
essentially a two dimensional game?  I don't think so, because it
started as a three dimensional game, it makes sense as a three
dimensional game, and a two dimensional morph is simply a
representation which loses detail, however playable.

I prefer my own two dimensional representation of Box Hex with the arcs
because, among other things, the circles are smaller.  There's less
area to color in.

This all is not a huge big deal for me.  I don't know why I'm getting
all whipped up about it.  Box Hex is not exactly my crowning
achievement.  Normally I would never design a variant.  I just wanted
to have a game which is played with a printed sheet of paper and two
felt pens, and a Hex variant seemed like the way to go.

Let me ask you guys something.  Putting aside my braggadocio, ill
founded claims for the moment, does Box Hex seem to have any redeeming
qualities?

|I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.

Suppose someone were to independently come up with the pattern of
blue cells I show in the above link. That person might argue that
such a board could be distorted into a box shape as you describe,
but it does not change the essential two-dimensional nature of
the game. How would such reasoning be different from yours?

Mark's point here seems to be that, when the board is embedded in
the surface of a cube, the game's distance metric for any given
path closely matches the physical length of that path.

So, are you suggesting the board should be asymmetric? Your Box Hex

Mark's point here seems to be, not "symmetric", but "centralized".

It seems (I am no kind of expert) that, in regular Hex, the
better shortest-paths are the ones in the middle (because it's
harder to box you in against an edge); hence, there's a single
area (the middle) of primary importance.  In Box Hex, you have
two shortest-paths, equally good; the more a given move hinders
one, the less it hinders the other; hence, there's no single
area of primary importance.
