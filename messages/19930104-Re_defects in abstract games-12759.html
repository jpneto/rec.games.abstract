|&gt; Many people have referred to draws in my game SUSAN even though I have no
|&gt; specific rule defining a draw.  I imaging the same same thing happens
|&gt; with Abalone which also lacks a rule defining draws.  The no repeats rule
|&gt; can be used to create the ko situation and eliminate draws, or it can be
|&gt; used as a way to define a draw.  When is one preferable over the other?
|&gt; Would Chess be 'improved' by eliminating draws?  Would Go be 'improved'
|&gt; by adding them?  What makes these two cases so different?

Under British go rules (which may have changed since I crossed the pond)
draws are possible due to the 6-point komi - most countries use 5.5 points
to eliminate draws. Stalemate such as triple Ko is also possible (Japanese
ko rule is used); most tournaments treat this as a draw rather than a void
game due to time constraints. Draws don't happen very often but they're a
lot of fun when they do. IMO social and club games are improved by them, but
tournament games are better off without.

What makes the two cases different? In Chess repeating situations are much
less frequent than in Go, where they are so common that much of the tactical
and strategic play revolves around their resolution. If a repeating position
could lead to stalemate, it would be too easy to stalemate the game. Triple
Ko is too difficult to set up for this to be a significant problem.

Fighting for a points draw is not a serious strategy because it only takes
1 more point to win.
