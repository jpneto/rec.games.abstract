Current Rules:

1.  The current state of the game is represtented by a posting of the
    following form, having always a "Current Rules:" section and
    (optionally) a "Proposal by" and "Votes in favour" sections.

	Current Rules:

	&lt;Old rules&gt;
	&lt;Old rules&gt;
	&lt;Old rules&gt;
	&lt;Old rules&gt;

	Proposal by &lt;name of proposer&gt;:

	&lt;Proposed amendment/rule change/rule deletion&gt;

	Votes in favour:

	&lt;Name 1&gt;
	&lt;Name 2&gt;
	[...]
	&lt;Name k&gt;

2.  A move consists of following up to a previous move (posting).  The
    move must meet the following constraints:

    It must be in the form specified by Rule 1.

    The contents of the "Current Rules:" section must be identical to
    the original.

    The "Proposal by" section may be changed, but if so, no matter how
    minor the modification, the "Votes in favour" section must be
    absent from the new posting.

    If the "Proposal by" section is unchanged, the poster may add their
    name to the "Votes in favour" section.  No other changes from the
    original are allowed.

3.  This rule has precedence over rule 2.

    When a move (posting) has the required number of votes in favour, a
    new move (posting) may instead add the proposed rule to the list of
    current rules as the next sequentially numbered rule, with no
    "Proposeal by" and no "Votes in favour" sections.  At this point,
    the proposed rule change takes effect.

4.  Even when repealed or amended by a later rule, the text of a rule
    stays unchanged in the list of current rules.

5.  The person who proposes a rule may not add their name to the "Votes
    in favour" section.

6.  Each individual is only allowed to have their name once in the "Votes
    in favour secton" of a posting.  However, an individual may have their
    name in as many different postings as they wish.

7.  Non-moves may be posted, for whatever purpose the person may wish.
    Non-moves are postings that are not in the form requred by rule 1.

101	All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect,
	in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in the
	Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins.  The Initial
	Set consists of Rules 1-7 and 101-116 (immutable) and 201-212
	(mutable).

102     Initially, rules with numbers less than 200 are immutable and
	the other rules are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or
	transmuted (i.e.  changed from immutable to mutable or vice
	versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers,
	and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of
	their numbers.

103	A rule change is any of the following:  (1)  the enactment, repeal,
	or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amend-
	ment of an amendment, or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule 
	into a mutable rule, or vice versa.  (Note:  This definition implies
	that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable.  Immutable rules, 
	as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable
	rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed.  No
	rule is absolutely immune to change.)

104	All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.  
	They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number
	of votes.

105	Every person capable of posting in the required form is an eligible
	voter.

106     If a rule change is adopted as allowed by rule 3, it must guide
        play in the form in which it was voted on.

107     No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
        completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
	explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have
	retroactive application.

108	Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number (ordinal
	number) for reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each
	rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next suc-
	cessive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

	If a rule is repealed and then re-enacted, it receives the ordinal
	number of the proposal to re-enact it.  If a rule is amended or 
	transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to
	amend or transmute it.  If an amendment is amended or repealed, 
	the entire rule of which it is a part receives the ordinal number
	of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

109	Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules 
	may be adopted if and only if they receive 24 votes.

110	Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some immutable
	rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are wholly void and
 	without effect.  They do not implicitly transmute immutable rules
	into mutable rules and at the same time amend them.  Rule changes
	that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules will be effective
	if and only if they explicitly state their transmuting effect.

111	If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical,
	or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two
	or more rule changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no
	difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then
	the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the 
	proposal before the vote.  A reasonable amount of time must be 
	allowed for this debate.  The proponent decides the final form
	in which the proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to
	end debate and vote.  The only cure for a bad proposal is to not
	vote for it.

112	The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed from
	achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  However, the 
	magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and
	rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be
 	enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

113	A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than 
	continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse than
	losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

114	There must always be at least one mutable rule.  The adoption of rule
	changes must never become completely impermissible.

115	Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes
	are as permissible as other rule changes.  Even rule changes that
	amend or repeal their own authority are permissible.  No rule change
	or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-
	reference or self-application of a rule.

116	Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is
	permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the
	rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules 
	explicitly or implicitly permits it.



			 II.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Mutable Rules<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>


201	All players begin with zero points.

202	There is no rule 202.

203	A rule change is adopted if and only if the rule change receives at
	least 12 votes.

204	There is no rule 204.

205	An adopted rule change takes full effect when added to the list
	of current rules as allowed by rule 3.

206	When a proposed rule change is accepted, the player who proposed it
	gains 5 points.

207	Each player always has exactly one vote.

208	The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.

209	At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.

210	There is no rule 210.

211	If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two
	or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule
	with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

	If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
	that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes prece-
	dence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions
	shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

	If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to
	defer to one another, then the numerical method must again govern.

212     If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
	interpretation or application of a rule, their sole recourse is
	to post a non-move containing their argument, and to refrain
	from posting follow-ups (moves) to the move they object to.

        Rule 202 to be change to read as follows:

	When a proposed rule change is accepted, every person who voted in

        ".edu" gains 15 points.
