Here's a game I used to play with my little brother. We'd each write a number 
down on a piece of paper, and whoever wrote down the biggest number was the 
winner. 

So, inspired by the Mornington Crescent game, I propose the following rules
for "The Biggest Number Game" (as my brother calls it).


 Players: 2 or more

 Rules:

   1. Each person writes down a number on a piece of paper, and then everyone
      shows their number. The winner is the person who has written down the 
      greatest number.

   2. Number must be specified exactly. That means you can't write down something
      like "My number is equal to the total number of electrons in the observable
      universe".

   3. You must use notation that all players understand. In other words, if
      someone uses the term "googleplex" and another player has not heard it
      before, then that person using the term is disqualified. Also, all players
      must be able to recognize what number you've specified just by looking at
      what you've written down on the paper - no verbal explanations are allowed.
      
   4. You must be able to specify your number on one side of one sheet of paper.


This is sort of an open ended version of the games "Flaunt" and "Undercut" that
Douglas Hofstadter talks about in "Metmagical Themas". Like Mornington Crescent,
you probably need more psychology than skill to be good at this game (if you ever
actually play it!).
