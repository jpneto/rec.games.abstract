Hi.  My roommate has a game called Oh Wah Ree.  It has twelve pots
arranged in a circle, and lots of little stones.  It also has some
(maybe four) other holes in the middle.  She used to enjoy it years
ago, but can't remember how it's played, and doesn't have the rules.
She would also love to hear about the origins and history of the
game.  Any information on either of these aspects would by highly
appreciated.

Cheers

Mark
