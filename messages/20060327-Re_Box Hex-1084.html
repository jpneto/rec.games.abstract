Thanks for providing a free game, but...

Are the users supposed to peer and reach into the box, in order to
play?

This is essentially a two-dimensional game. It is equivalent to the

Let the blue lines outline the cells which may be played in here.

As an experienced Hex player, I don't see that you have eliminated the
need for the pie rule at all. The advantage of the first move is a
TEMPO asymmetry, not a board asymmetry. So, your new version
makes play around the four corner cells more important. Suppose
the first player has the solid circle border rows on your grid. As the
first player, I am sure that playing in the cell marked with a purple
dot (or probably almost any central cell) would lead to an easy win.

There have been plenty of alternate maps suggested for Hex.

The pie rule is recommended for all these variants.
