A good source of rules for abstract games is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com">www.zillions-of-games.com</a>.

if you don't have the software, the web pages list the rules for literally
hundreds of  abstract games, some traditional and some original.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ah, no, the rules to most of those games are NOT listed on the website
itself. There is room there for only a brief description of each game.
If you download the zipfile, it will usually contain a text or html
document which explains the rules in detail. But sometimes the rules
are embedded inside the Zillions help menu for that game, which means
you have to look at the source code file, which has the extension .zrf

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I disagree.  While it is true sometimes it just involves a vague description, I
find that most of the time the rules are included on the game's web page.  Most
abstract strategy games are simple enough to describe in a few paragraphs.  I
know a couple of people who don't own the software but still use the website as
a source of game rules, so there are people who do this.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Okay, I suppose you could play a game based on the description of most
of those games, but I find that all too frequently crucial details are
left out, such as what the initial board set up is, how to handle
certain situations such as non-terminating games, etc. When I download
the file, I often find that these details are left out there as well,
so you would probably do just as well by reading the web page.

Virtually all of those games were just made up by the author of that
script, and are not for sale anywhere as a physical set. So, there's a
lot of chaff to sift through, to find games that are really worth
pursuing. It helps to have the Zillions engine, to get a feel for the
basic tactics.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This presumes that the only worthwhile games are the ones that are being
published.  In fact, a lot of the best abstract games have never been published
or had only a limited publishing run.  Abstract strategy games that have a
continous publishing run are very much the exception and not the rule.  That
this website carries games that can not be found anywhere is precisely what
makes it so appealing.  Granted there is a mix of both good and bad games, but
that's what you'll find with any extensive compilation.

If there is a mix of good and bad, it follows that there must be chaff
to sift through, yes? The only difference between your statement and
mine, as far as I can tell, is I said "a LOT of chaff". If I am
presuming that the ONLY worthwhile games are published games, why
would I mention that there are games really worth pursuing on the
Zillions site?

It's easy to make up the rules to a new abstract game. Making up the
rules to an INTERESTING abstract game is a bit more challenging. I
guess it depends on how easily amused you are. :-)
