Congrats for another original mechanism, I really like it. I have some reservations regarding clarity, visualizing the territories filled in and checking for the 'common neighbor' for diagonally adjacent stones at the same time. But I haven't played it and it may not be more than a newbie's problem. It certainly looks like a fast and very organic game!

Thank you, Christian :)

Just in case, regarding the common neighbor issue, please note that the only stone which must be checked is the newly placed one, and only with respect to friendly stones <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>outside<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> any territories, provided that these are filled with friendly stones.

At first, my only minor concern was the necessary counting when claiming territories, but I've played the game several times now and territories bigger than 3-4 points seem to be conveniently unusual: as soon as you realize that you're behind in the stone count for any particular territory, you simply won't be willing to expand it further.
