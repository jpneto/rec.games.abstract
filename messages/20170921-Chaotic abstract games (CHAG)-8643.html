Yes! I designed a new kind of abstract games.
I called them chaotic abstract games (CHAG) without even defining them.
The chaos is not about the board type, nor about the pieces,....
The chaos is inherent to the game play.
Imagine that each and any move will lead to complete new situation where the player have to decide a move like if it is his first move. Otherwise the game is purely tactical. No one can build a strategy. The game duration is infinite. Each player score points and that`s it. Like a boxing fight but without Ko`s. 
I developed some ideas about such type of games.
For sure it exists even if I did not check it some particular game having such property. Then it will be considered as really new game. It will have some fatherhood.
My idea is to generate 1000`s games built on such chaos.
So I need to design some common pattern with few parameters.
It will be then easy for anyone to build his own game using his own ideas.
Everyone could be a game designer! 

I will come back to give more precise view about what I have in mind.
For now I had just put my concept using few words letting many questions unanswered.
