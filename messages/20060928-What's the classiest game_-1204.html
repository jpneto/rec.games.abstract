Is it just me, or does it seem that abstract, perfect-information,
deterministic (no randomity) strategy games are generally considered
the classiest of all games?

Chess and go, for example, are world renowned.  Royalty has been known
to willingly be associated with these games, and many people regard
them as more than just games.  They've generated a wealth of
respectable literature.

Contrast that with backgammon, another age-old classic.  Popular
opinion seems to hold that it's a lesser game--probably because of the
dice.  Even bridge, though highly regarded, somehow lacks the class
that chess and go enjoy.

There may be exceptions, though.  Checkers (draughts) has long been
disparaged as an inferior version of chess--something for children or
old folks to kill time with.  Yet those who know the truth about
checkers rightfully hold it in high regard.

Some abstract games have faded into obscurity.  But whenever someone
reaches into the shadows and drags out hnefatafl or seega or nine men's
morris, the awe and respect is still there.  They're not just
historical artifacts; there's an enduring mystery and challenge to
these games.

Even abstract games of more modern invention--Gipf, for instance--seem
to be regarded as superior to the vast majority of games that are
available.

Or are they?  Maybe I'm the only one who sees this phenomenon.  Am I
just imagining things, or do some kinds of games have a classier
reputation than others?

And while we're at it, which game do you think is the classiest--and
why?
