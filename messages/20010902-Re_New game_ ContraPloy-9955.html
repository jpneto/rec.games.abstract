I argue that point.  In my game, each player arranges and has complete
control of his own pieces.  There is no luck.

But I agree it's not abstract -- I read the definition in the FAQ.  So
why did I post here?  Well for one, considering that "She gets NASTY"
and similar garbage resides here, I figured I couldn't make things any
worse!

And second, I need an audience.  Regardless of how you define the
game, ContraPloy is a GOOD game.  I've put years of work and
playtesting into it, and I know what I'm doing.  (And frankly, my
immediate family is getting tired of playing me.)

I posted on rec.games.board, but there's so much going on over there,
and those guys are all over the map, that I don't think I'm reaching
anybody.  I looked at some of the rec.games.chess groups, but I'll
tell you, those guys are SERIOUS.  I'll dare to go off-topic over
there when I want an angry mob tracking down where I live and burning
my house, my shed, and my dog to the ground.  I don't fit
rec.games.computer (maybe I can attract some of those DOOM players?),
or rec.games.pbm either.

So here I am.  You're my closest cousins; I'm here to stay; so you may
as well learn to like it.  (And thanks, David D for making me feel
welcome.)

And please, don't just talk about the game -- TRY THE GAME.

Jim
