This [the posted table of contents of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>New Rules<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>] was VERY
interesting, and has just been added to the list of game books that
I must at least have a prolonged look at, if not buy.  Could someone
post a similar list for Sid Sackson's "A Gamut of Games"?

Sure.
Not all of these games are appropriate for this group, but for sake of
completion I list them all---I hope nobody minds.  The information,
including the short descriptions is straight from the contents pages of
the book.
