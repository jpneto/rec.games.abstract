I happen to like Fischer Random Chess (I don't like to call it
"Chess960", because I think Bobby Fischer deserves credit for
his invention) but it is not chess, and thus there is no need
to "integrate it into the chess community."

I've checked into this a bit more, and I see that indeed Chess960
isn't the original Shuffle Chess, but is instead indeed an alternate
name for Fischer's precise version.

I agree that anyone who invents something should be given credit, but
given some of R. J. Fischer's unfortunate actions and statements
during the latter part of his career, I'm afraid that anything with
his name on it will be anathema to many people. Such as, to give one
example, Kosovars, and to give another example, New Yorkers.

I think I understand how they feel, but it still reminds me of
Freedom Fries and Victory Cabbage.  If racism and anti-Semitiism
is reason to deny a person credit for his inventions, Thomas 
Edison and Henry Ford both outdid Bobby Fischer in racism and 
hate. Edison made many racist and racist and anti-Semitic comments 
(and they were spread far more widely because of his fame), and 
Henry Ford wrote a hate-filled book called _The International Jew: 
The World's Foremost Problem_, with the usual brain-dead garbage 
about Jews causing all of the problems of the world.  Yet I don't 
see anyone refusing to call a Ford a Ford.
