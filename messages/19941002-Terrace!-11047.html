TERRACE!  I first saw this board game at the international toy fair in 1992, 
and to this day it is one of my favorite games.

RULES:

Paraphrased from the original board game rules.

OBJECT OF THE GAME: To capture your opponent's "T" gamepiece (the small piece 
marked "T" OR to move your own "T" to the lowest square on the opposite side of 
the board.

SETTING UP THE BOARD:

The TERRACE board is an 8 * 8 grid (like in chess or checkers) that has a 3D 
aspect to it. It is shaped like a hyperboloid. The numbers in the following 
diagram represent the heights of each position on the board. 1 is the lowest, 
and 8 is the highest. In the actual board game, each subsequent level is about 
1/8 of an inch higher than the previous level on a 16" square board.

                                    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
                                    7 7 6 5 4 3 2 2
                                    6 6 6 5 4 3 3 3
                                    5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4
                                    4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5
                                    3 3 3 4 5 6 6 6
                                    2 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Notice that the board has L-shaped "terraces"--where the numbers (and levels) 
stay the same.

Each player starts with either 6 or 16 pieces, depending upon which game will 
be played. 6 pieces for the "short" game or 4 player game, or 16 pieces for the 
"full length" game.

There are 5 kinds of pieces. Each is a different size. Here, they will be 
refered to as A (the smallest), B, C, D (the largest), and T (the t-piece).

SETUPS:                                                            OBJ (t,TT)

HOW TO MOVE:

On the same terrace:

In a single turn, a gamepiece can move ANY NUMBER of squares to ANY VACANT 
SQUARE ON THE SAME TERRACE (A). It can jump over (without capturing or 
removing) one or more of its own gamepieces, but it CANNOT jump over an 
opponent's gamepiece (B). A gamepiece can never cross the board diagonally at 
the center (C).

Up a terrace:

A gamepiece can move STRAIGNE UP (A &amp; B) or DIAGONALLY UP (A &amp; B), one square 
at a time, to a vacant square on the terrace above it.

Down a terrace:

A gamepiece can move ONLY STRAIGHT DOWN (A &amp; B) one square at a time, to a 
vacant square on the terrace below it.  The gamepiece may NOT move down 
diagnally--a move reserved only for Capturing.

an "*."                is an "*."

How to Capture:

A capture can be made only by moving DIAGNALLY DOWN (A &amp; B), one square, to the 
terrace below, to a square occupied by a gamepiece of the SAME SIZE OR SMALLER. 
The captured gamepiece can be an opponent's or THE PLAYER'S OWN. This strategy 
of sacrificing, or CANNIBALIZING, one's own gamepiece can effectively protect a 
larger (more valuable) one or enable the larger one to escape an opponent's 
trap. The captured gamepiece is removed from the board.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
"c" can capture        "D" can capture
the other "c" that     the other "D" that
is below it, or it     is below it, or it
can capture the "B"    can capture the "c"
piece.                 or "a" piece.

Courtesy:

It is courteous to announce "Terrace" when you put an opponent's "t" in 
jeopardy of being captured on your next move and to announce "Terrace-mate" 
when that "t" cannot escape and you have won the game.

3 &amp; 4 Player games:

When a player loses his/her "t," that player's pieces are removed from the 
board. Other players continue the game.

Draws:

If a player cannot make a move during his/her turn, the game is a draw, with no 
winner and no loser.
