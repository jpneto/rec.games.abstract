Construct a n * n matrix, where n is the number of players in the

Ungh, no, that does not make a proper matrix. The ratios have to be
normalized somehow so they sum to one, and there definitively should
be some bayesian averaging or what they call it, so that the player
who scores the first win doesn't just get allowed to run away with
that 1 ratio!

Still, I hope you get my idea. Richard, I did explore it somewhat (and
posted it) on your forums.

So long as it works and effectively evaluates people, that is what I
care about mostly.  IAGO is about innovation and getting things to
work.  When you deal with a wide range of abstract strategy games, and
variants, innovation and having things work are the name, not stuck up
"tradition" where you get married to things because that is how you
always did it.
