An advancing piece that is directly challenged by the opponents piece(s), is forced to

If a directly-challenged piece is unable to advance - i.e. a blocked game with no moves,
leaps or slides possible, the opponent points out which players piece - with the
exception of the piece(s) on the target tile - the player is forced to move instead.
The player then uses the selected piece - and follows the Movement rules..
If the game is still blocked, after the selected piece has been moved and a tile slid, the
person who selected the piece (and whose turn it is now) removes that piece from the board and resumes game play.

anyone please...
I'm lost.

Other than this the game looks pretty cool.  I made a board already.

If it's indeed in the contest then I'll need an answer soon as
tomorrow I'll present the hopefully finished boards and rules to the
people who come to the abstract games workshop at the spielwiese and I
don't want to waste peoples time with a game which isn't in the
contest or has a rule nobody can decipher.

I'm not sure if anyone will show up other than Dave, but here's the
advertisement I posted on the website to the games shop:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.spielwiese-berlin.de/blog/">http://www.spielwiese-berlin.de/blog/</a>

Here's a mail I just received from Martin (March 9):

"Hello Christian,

How's things?
I revisited Parquet and decided to reduce it to its simplest form ...
if it's not too late?
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://parquet.webstarts.com/">http://parquet.webstarts.com/</a>

All the best,
Martin S."

I guess it's not too late.
