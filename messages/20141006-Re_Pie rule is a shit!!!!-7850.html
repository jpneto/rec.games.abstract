When you see international chess masters playing ches blindly with 20 players you ask your yourself about playing on 2 boards.
In any abstract game at some level of competition professional players use tricks first before using their brain.
Why? because many situations are not new for the professional players.
So the players need to focus only on surprising moves.
Sometimes I go to watch finished games on some specialized sites with comments. Professional players do know when a master whose level is higher than them made a mistake.
Playing on 2 boards at the same time it is just a question of habit.
