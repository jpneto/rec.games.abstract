What did you get exactly? I see that I made an offhand remark about
how your weekly rants, musings and "tidbits" are not the most relevant
and interesting topics on this site, then you overreacted, making a
very childish remark. Then I pointed out that you had just hoisted
yourself by your own petard and offered to not let the situation
escalate and you just turned it down. Perhaps you'd rather we all just
talk behind your back? It was Nick Bentley who told me "RGA used to be
a collection of some of the greatest minds in the abstract games
community before Mark chased them out.". I think I'll accept his
theory that the flow of traffic on this site has been reduced by your
use of it as a personal blog. If you want to muse about Kris Burm, or
attack Christian Freeling, go use your blog and don't try to justify
spamming this site with some obfuscation about being an ant in such a
big mean world. You're effectively a whole colony of very surly ants
which nobody in their right mind would accept into their home. Nobody
is coming to this site wondering what your personal opinion is of
anything, period! This site is here promote the discussion of abstract
games and to share new ones.
