Most of the Monkey Queen feedback has been extraordinarily positive, the
notable exception being Corey Clark's comment, which he entered into the
game chat of a play already completed between me and Christian:

"what a piece of shit!"

Perplexing since Corey had already described Monkey Queen as a sure winner
of the contest, and because before his comment I thought we were on
agreeable terms.

Here's a link to the game, which was in fact a particularly interesting play
of Monkey Queen:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=164670&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en">http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=164670&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en</a>

Christian did surprisingly well for the first several moves into the game -
a model of how to play the opening game.  I was running out of options
faster than normal.  But Christian made the common error of going for the
kill without having enough babies on the board yet.  It can be done, yes,
but if you don't succeed, you'll be behind.  Not that it's game over at that
point, but it is a predicament.

I have no idea what's going on with Corey Clark.  First he said he would
have an entry for the stacking game contest.  Then later he bowed out,
saying he had "moved on" to other things, and no longer had time for such
nonsense.  But apparently there's still time for an impromptu critique of
Monkey Queen.
