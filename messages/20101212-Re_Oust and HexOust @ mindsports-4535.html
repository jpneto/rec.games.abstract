Christian Freeling is hurling mud in a completely unjustified manner.
For the record, Bill Taylor is also interested in abstract games.

Take this thread as an example.
There was nothing to provoke the third post:
Bill Taylor: "..and if you wouldn't mind sucking my dick for a few
minutes too... "
Nor the fifth:
Bill Taylor: "Slurp, slurp, slurp... "

The seventh might be considered provoked:
Corey Clark: "Steere didn't anyone ever teach you not to talk with
your mouth full
of cum?"
In case German professors are unfamiliar with slang expressions, he
means "semen".

And then there's humor, spelled 'humour' is you're educated in
Germany, of which you state so humorously:

"It must be humor in order to be humor" ...
Indeed, Germans <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> funny, that has been officially established at
Leiptzig University. How could people possibly have a different sense
of humor!

Let me agree this once with Bill Taylor - who at least has the courage
not to hide behind ridiculous nicknames - in the ninth post here:
"BWA-HA-HA-HA-HAH!!"

And return to what this thread is about:
(Hex)Oust can now be played at MindSports.
