My question is not an innocent one.
Where the revolution in the abstract game field could come from?
New board or play arena?
New "pieces" (robotic pieces?)
New way of moving ?
New way of capturing?
New way of scoring?
Minimalist game with no more than 3 rules?
New victory`s condition?
An infinite game with no definitive winner nor definitive looser?
and so on
Or all the points above?

Let us think about my question. 

Hey Mark! No new game?
Are you sleeping or are you at the end of the creation process?
We could revive the forum if you wanted 2.
There are no mandarinate here no one to kow-tow to (except you? ha ha ha)
BGG is going to be more and more mediocre as long as the mandarinate rules.
