 While scanning through a dictionary on nordic mythology
 I thumbled over an entry that says something about a
 "royal boardgame" called "fidchell". The entry is about
 Lug, a famous celtic god, who reached the court of Nuadu
 Argetlam right after the second battle of Mag Turied.
 Nuadu challenges Lug in this "royal boardgame fidchell"...

Amazing...I've actually managed to find one of those many pieces of paper 
with something interesting on it that I file away at random.  This was almost 
going to read like---Umm, well I have some info on fidchell <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>somewhere<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>...

Well here it is...

from <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Chess in Europe<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (don't know the author--only have 2 photocopied pages)

   In the Celtic story, Peredur comes to the Castle of Wonders and sees there 
a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>gwyddbwyll<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> board, on which the men were playing aginst each other...

   The exact nature of the game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>gwyddbwyll<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>(20) is now unknown, and was 
probably unknown in Chrestien's day.  It was certainly a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>board-game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and it 
was only natural that Chrestien and his successors should substitute the 
familiar chess for the old Celtic game.

(20) The game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>gwyddbwyll<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is frequently mentioned in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Mabinogion<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and in 
other early Welsh works.  None of the references give any clue as to the 
nature of the game, but none imply that there was any differentiation of piece 
other than that necessary to distinguish the one side from the other.

...[discussion of possible confusion of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>gwyddbwyll<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>tawlbwrdd<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>/French 
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>tables<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and the Norse game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>hnefatafl<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Tawlbwrdd<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> -- 2 sides, one with 16 
men, the other 8 men &amp; a king---apparently identical to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>hnefatafl<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>]...

   The word gwyddbwyll is historically identical with the Irish word 
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fidchell<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and this latter word occurs repeatedly in early Irish works as the 
name of a game.  Thus it occurs in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Cormac's Glossary<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (ed. W. Stokes 1862-8), 
where it is said that 'in the first place the fidchell is four-cornered, its 
squares are right-angled, and black and white are on it, and moreover, it is 
different people that in turn win the game'.  Other Irish references add 
nothing to our knowledge, with the possible exception of---(1) a passage in 
the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Acallamh<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> [long reference] which describes how Cailte and the King of 
Connacht played at fidchell.  When the board was brought, three men were 
missing.  Cailte fetched 3 gold and 3 silver men from a cairn where a game had 
been hidden.  Each of these men was as big as a big man's fist, and he told 
the King that he had left 300 men, half gold and half silver, in the cairn.  
(2) The 15th c. <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Book of Lismore<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (still unedited), describing a gift of a 
fidchell to Pope Boneface in the 7th c., says that it had nine lines, and half 
of the pieces were men and half women.  By the 15th c. the real nature of the 
game was certainly completely forgotten.

Phew...I think I'll leave it to someone else to fill you in on Lugh Lamhfhada 
(of the Long Arm)and Nuada Airgeadlamh (Silver Hand).  Marie-Louise 
Sjoestedt's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Gods and Heroes of the Celts<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (1940, reprint 1982 Turtle Island 
Foundation, Berkely CA) is probably a good start if you're interested in that 
kinda stuff.
