Timing.  When you release three games in short order, the third game is met
with resentment, sight unseen.  Like "Jeez haven't you punished us enough
already?"  If you release more than three games in short order, you're
villified.  You're like a pimp with a bevy of underage girls strung out on
heroin.

Yep, several less than commendable motives motives played a role, but
I count escaping a looming winter depression as a commendable one. The
flipside is that if you fail, depression wins.

This is part of why I wanted to extend the contest to the whole winter.
Sometimes you go to invent a game and you end up inventing a few.  Plus you
need time for post-feedback tweaking.

There should be a vote-down per inventor.  So first everyone decides which

Fine with me, I'm hoping for some more feedback, but I see Jump Sturdy
as my most likely entry. Thematically I prefer Soar: in my twisted
theme hierarchy, dismembering an opponent into non-existence is
considered a more noble course than breaking through his lines and
bolting in the opposite direction to reach some arbitrary goal like
'the back rank'. In that respect Monkey Queen ranks higher too,
besides almost creating a new category of "chess checkers".
But fortunately there quite enough slaughter going on in JS, and a one-
on-one may even be won by opposition - that's where compulsory
movement and the sideways move jump in. Of course if there's no
opposition, then it's decided on tempo. Soft finitude again :)

What about an additional 'vote of the public' - could that be
organized / implemented, or should it, for that matter?
