I was for many years both a tournament chess player (am
past president of the Virginia Chess Federation) and a
tournament checker player and have a strong interest in
both games, though I no longer play either other than with
my computer (raising four kids leave time for little else).

Certainly there are points in common.

A good friend of mine has been a state chess champion and a

	Yes maybe it would; but the current thread is about the checkers

Finally, when I was in Chicago one of my favorite chess
opponents at the No Exit Cafe rapid tournaments was David
Slate, who was one of the programmers of the then world
chess champion computer program.  David was working then on
a checkers program as well.  I would love to hear his
perspective today on both games (by the way, anybody know
David's whereabouts? -- I left Chicago in 1980, and
organized chess in 1982).

I learned about the Tinsley match by reading the chess
group.  I had not realized the abstract games group covered
checkers.  And I think that on topics which overlap both
games (and the ability of computers to play does)
