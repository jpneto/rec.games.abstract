Hello,


Appears to be interesting, but your rules are incomplete. What do you do
do when the ball is bumped off the side edges?

Polatty Pressure (Huang Variation)

Two players, taking turns.

The game is played on a 11x19 board (half of a Go board).
It uses one black token (which we'll call the "ball") and
an unlimited supply of white tokens (which we'll call
"pressors").  Players sit across from each other, with
one length-11 edge facing each player.  The closer edge
is called the "goal line".

Goal:  To use pressors to push the ball to the opponent's
 goal line.

Rules:  On your turn, you may do one of the following:
  1.  Place a pressor on an empty space adjacent to the
      ball (including diagonally).
  2.  Pass your turn, but only if your opponent has not
      just passed.  (Therefore, by passing, you force
      your opponent to play.)

When a pressor is placed on an empty space adjacent to the
ball, the ball is "bumped" one space away from the pressor.
If that space is occupied by another pressor, then that pressor
is "bumped" one space further, and so on.
  If a pressor on a goal line is bumped, it is bumped "off the
edge" and leaves play.
  If a pressor on the edge of the board is bumped diagonally,
it "reflects" off the edge and bumps diagonally at 90 degrees
to the original direction.
  If a pressor on the edge of the board is bumped horizontally,
it is pushed to the side (at 90 degrees to the original direction),
away from the player whose turn it is.
