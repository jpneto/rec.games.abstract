<br>And they haven't obviously worked that well, as soccer still has plenty

<br>But the point is that they were instituted to solve a "draw problem"

<br>the scoring in chess.
<br>
<br>I am actually curious what changes the altered scoring had on
<br>soccer. Are you aware of any analyses?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>You still aren't

<br></blockquote>
<br>Much like we don't debate the merits of breathing oxygen. The very fact
<br>that
<br>chess' draw situation is an extreme compared with almost every other
<br>human contest should tell you something.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It tells us that similarly ranked chess players are fairly evenly
<br>matched.
<br></blockquote>
<br>No. It tells us that if the scoring system makes the return on playing
<br>for a win low, that chessplayers are smart enough to figure that out
<br>and play in a way that produces lots of draws.
<br>
<br>
<br>This is not actually Big News, and a game that reflects that
<br><blockquote type=cite>is hardly broken.&nbsp; The "breathing oxygen" thing is such preposterous
<br>exaggeration it looks to be the work of a straw-man manufacturing expert.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>According to Wikipedia "Conventional komi in most competitions is a
<br>half-integer....
<br>This is convenient and the prevailing usage for tournaments, since it
<br>rules out a tied
<br>game and rematches."
<br></blockquote>
<br>But of course the outcome of, and logistics of running, a tournament is
<br>a different thing to the outcome of a game.&nbsp; You shouldn't assume they
<br>mean the same thing.
<br></blockquote>
<br>But the point is that Go typically designs its rules so that ties are
<br>impossible at high level events. No doubt there is a connection
<br>between that fact and the fact that Go tournaments have bigger
<br>prize funds.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I suspect that even with your integer komi, draw rates are nowhere near as
<br>high as the cancer it has become in high-level chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>They're not as high, but in Chess it isn't a cancer, it's an aspect of
<br>the game.&nbsp; if you don't like the game then play one you do like rather
<br>that bugger about with metagaming aspects that aren't really much to do
<br>with the fundamental game underneath.
<br></blockquote>
<br>If alternate scoring eliminates the GM draw, and makes chess games,
<br>on average, more combative and more interesting, what is the downside?
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>For a game with "cancer" that you seem to think breaks it, Chess is
<br><b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>remarkably<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> popular!&nbsp; The more you complain it's broken, the more its
<br>enduring popularity at all levels demonstrates it isn't.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's popular to play. But note that at the amateur level,
<br>draws are far rarer.
<br>
<br>The fundamental mystery of chess is why such a
<br>popular game has so little attention paid to its best
<br>players. The answer, I think, is that the best
<br>players are playing in competitions in which
<br>draw-producing play and strategies based
<br>on drawing rule. Chessplayers are human and
<br>humans respond to drama. If 75% of games
<br>are draws, and many of those draws are
<br>not even contested, you've got a situation that
<br>is designed to alienate the average chess
<br>enthusiast. Now I will grant that how much
<br>better things can be is an unknown - but we will
<br>never know until we try.
<br>
<br>In fact the chess world has from time to time
<br>introduced various rules (e.g. the Sophia rules)
<br>to deal with the draw problem, but these have
<br>largely been ineffective. I think that all measures
<br>that ignore the underlying risk/reward calculations
<br>that chessplayers face are destined to fail.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>You sound like a Go enthusiast trying to kill off chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I do?&nbsp; I prefer Go to Chess, but I still like Chess.&nbsp; It does different
<br>things well, and I don't think it needs changing.
