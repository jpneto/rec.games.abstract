How does Go change if you allow movement?

Keep all Go rules as they are, and add this one:
Players may move 1 stone 1 intersection, moving along the grid lines, each turn. 

As it makes a difference whether the move is made before or after the drop, players may choose either each turn, for maximum flexibility.

The move is optional each turn. The drop is not. 

DISCLAIMER: I believe Go is the quintessential drop game, and certainly does not need any improvement, as it might well be the best game ever designed, and is almost certainly the best abstract. 

GOmove started as a thought experiment, and is proving quite interesting in early play. Here's a game being played on Game Courier. As I don't program at all, I'm stuck using what I can to play experimental designs online, so the game is played on a 19x19 square grid with red and black markers placed in the squares and not on the intersections. Admittedly ugly, but it works.

What I'm looking for is someone to playtest this game. If you've got a better venue, please let me know. I admit to being surprised that I couldn't find any mention of this game anywhere. It seems a very easy and logical variant, and this version gives the least change from the original. SO if you are aware of this or similar games, please let me know.
