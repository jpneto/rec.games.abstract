My METAGAME WORKBENCH contains an implementation of chinese-chess as
an instance of symmetric chess-like games.  
However, this implementation does not capture <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the rules,
the most significant limitation being that horses and elephants
leap directly to the final square, whereas in the complete rules
they must travel through an intermediate square which must be
empty.  

I am not a very good chinese chess player, but have been told that
this dramatically alters the game.  Can any experienced players tell
me how much they think this difference should affect the overall
strategy of the game?

Also, I have implemented a general game-playing program which plays
all the games in this class, based on its own abstract analysis of the
rules of each game.  From my own experience playing against my
program, it appears to play pretty well.  If anyone would like to play
against my program and tell me how strong (or weak :-) it is, please
let me know and we can arrange a game even if you are not able to
install METAGAME on your system.  Lastly, if anyone has a chinese
chess-playing program which I could play against my own, that would
also be very helpful.
