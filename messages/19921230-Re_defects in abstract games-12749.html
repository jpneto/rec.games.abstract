I agree about the elegance bit.  However, the Chinese rules do not <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>add<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a
defect with the no-repeat rule: the Japanese rules instead have a ko-rule
which is also stateful, and therefore also a defect according to the sacred
definition :-)  (as well as being a significantly more ugly patch.)

i'm sorry.  i had a typo and let it go out...sorry...i meant to say:

"indeed, it may be that you have to add a defect patch in the name of
elegance."

i am still on this fence about whether a "no repeat" rule is always a
"defect patch".  i think i still have to lean that way - that it is a
defect patch.  but i was saying that "when you regard it as..." then
the elegance of it in making Go so successful outweighs the horror of
leaving it out in the name of "defect-freedom".
