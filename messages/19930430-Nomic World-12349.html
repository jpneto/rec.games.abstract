I logged onto Nomic World some time ago, and left messages, and emailed
apparently promising people, etc, but I never managed to find out:

Is a record of the rules proposals stored anywhere with the rules in
their original form (including deleted rules, etc)? That is, for example,
as a numbered list. All I could see was that I could request to see the
current versions of rules.

I would like something like:

...
505: A player wins the game if it is proven that he/she/it is older than
     100 Gregorian calendar years.
...
707: Rule 505 is amended such that "100" appearing therein becomes "150".
...


instead of:

...
505: A player wins the game if it is proven that he/she/it is older than
     150 Gregorian calendar years.
...
[No mention of rule 707, nor of original Rule 505. The Rule 505 shown will
have been marked by something like "last updated..." (I forget exactly)]
...


which appears to be all one can get hold of in the game.

Fairly silly rules, I guess, but hopefully you get the idea.
Maybe I missed something obvious, but one couldn't seem to get such a
listing of rules.

Am I mistaken?
