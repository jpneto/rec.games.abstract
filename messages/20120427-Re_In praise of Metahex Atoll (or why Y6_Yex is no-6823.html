An example: I started to play Hex at Little Golem an won three games in a row against players who have already played dozens of games by finding killer moves by pure reasoning. Not so in Havannah. I simply cannot find good moves here by reasoning. I call this game "experience based" rather than "reasoning based".

Experience will eventually give you the basic strategic lay-out a game will take after the first couple of moves. There's quite a number of them but all eventually evolve around speed and initiative. <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Counting<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is the fundament of all reasoning in Havannah.

By the way, I'm eagerly awaiting your response in your Dameo game against Benedikt. You're caught up in one of his Devil's Brew combinations I fear ;-)
