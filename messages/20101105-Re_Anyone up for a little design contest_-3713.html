I'm here for the fun of it, so how about this game called
"Whingi" (because that's what it says in the Validation box right
now).

I'm picturing a hexhexboard, say base-10. White moves first and the
game features a swap (corners and edges are the required bad cells
here).

A 'group' is a single stone or two or more like colored connected
stones.
On his move a player has two options, and can use both, either or
neither (the latter without losing the right to move next turn).

The options are (if used both, in that order):
1. Put a stone on a vacant cell, not adjacent to a like colored group,
thereby creating a new group.
2. Grow any or all of the groups that are already on the board by one
stone.

A stone connecting two or more different groups is considered to have
grown all off them. A player may only grow at groups as they exist at
the beginning of his turn, and no such group may grow more than one
stone in that particular turn.

That's the growing procedure of Symple. It means that if you have two
white stones AA and two white stones BB and two vacant cells XX, that
you may grow both AA and BB in this configuration:
AAXXBB
But not in this one:
AAXBBX
In the latter case either X may be grown by white, but not both.

There are three configurations of six stones:
1. Straight line
2. Compact triangle
3. Small hexagon

Any stone on the board may only be counted in ONE configuration
(otherwise you get bulk strategy with great lack of clarity).

The object is to create more configurations than the opponent. If both
have the same number, the player using the least number of stones
wins. If that too is equal, the game is a draw.
