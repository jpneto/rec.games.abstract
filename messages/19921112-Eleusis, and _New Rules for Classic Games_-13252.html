Eleusis is not a pure strategy game.  (If these interlopers keep
invading the newsgroup, then perhaps it's time to completely redo
rec.games.* :-)

The rules for Eleusis can be found in
	New Rules for Classic Games / R. Wayne Schmittberger, 1992

Here, it says Eleusis was invented in 1956 and revised between 1973
and 1976, so the version in the 1977 Mathematical Games column should
be current.

<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>New Rules<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> describes many games, game variants, new uses for your
moldering game equipment, techniques for modifying and repairing the
rules of games, etc.  A very interesting book.
