I am starting a Nomic style game by the name of Feudalist.  The
initial rules are listed below.  For those who don't know, Nomic is a
game of legislation, law-making.  To win you must create the rules
that allow you to win.  In the case of Feudalist you have to get the
Proposed rules past me and then start using them to your advantage.  I
will be accepting about eight new players myself, and will keep a list
of anyone else who wants to play for future reference.  Playing will
begin once I have five players.  If you want to join the game, e-mail
me at <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:wickedbob@inferno.com">&lt;wickedbob@inferno.com&gt;</a>.  First come first join.

Feudalist Rules:
 
1. All Players are attributed with a Rank of Nobility. The following
are the Ranks of Nobility, in decreasing order of importance. Emperor,
Archduke, Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, Baron, and Knight. All
Players of Rank Baron or Higher are members of the Peerage. There may
be only one Emperor at any given time in the game.

2. Players may join the game only if sponsored by a member of the
Peerage. New players start the game as Knights.

3. The Emperor's decision concerning the Rules is final.

4. Players may hold Office in various positions of the game. Rules are
used to describe the Offices available. Offices may be mandatory or
optional, and Rules describing Offices must indicate which. If
mandatory, the Rule must also state the minimum number of
Officeholders.  All Offices may have a maximum number of Officeholders
as well. Offices may have a minimum Rank, which must also be indicated
in the Rule for the Office. If the Office is to be held initially by a
current by a current Player, the Rule must indicate so. The activities
of the Office do not necessarily need to be indicated by the Rule.

5. The Office of Imperial Scribe is a mandatory Office. It may only be
held by one Player at a time. The Office of the Imperial Scribe may
only be held by a member of the Peerage. The Emperor is responsible
for appointing Players to this Office. The initial holder of this
Office is Jeff Sheets. The imperial Scribe is responsible for the
timely publication of the list of Rules and the history of Proposals.

6. Rules are created and changed via Proposals. All Proposals must be
submitted to the Imperial Scribe. All Players except the Emperor may
submit Proposals.

7. Upon Receipt of a Proposal, the Imperial Scribe may reword it for
clarity, but may not change the intended meaning of the Proposal. The
Scribe must then submit the Proposal to the Emperor at the next
available opportunity.

8. The Emperor will reject or accept all Proposals at his leisure. The
Emperor may change any Proposal in any way before accepting it as a
Rule.

9. Proposals are numbered in sequential order of submission. Rules are
numbered in sequential order upon acceptance by the Emperor.

10. The Emperor is Jeff Sheets / <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:wickedbob@inferno.com">&lt;wickedbob@inferno.com&gt;</a>.
