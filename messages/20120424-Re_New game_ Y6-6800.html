I find it hard to believe that no one has thought about it before, but after checking various sources (Wikipedia article about connection games and Y in particular, iggamecenter and others, I cannot find any reference to this game so here it goes. The game is played on a metahex board (a board in the form of a hex consisting of hex cells, like the one used in Havannah). Consecutive pairs of edges are marked with a distinct color and called sides. Corners where the sides meet belong to both sides simultaneously. The goal of the game is to create a chain of stones linking all three sides (like in Y). The game has the following advantages:

1) the distance from the center to an edge is equal to the length of the edge (in Y it is 1/3 only). In fact a metahex board is a circle in the hex metric (the distance between cells A and B is measured as the length of the shortest path connecting A and B).

2)it is the simplest symmetrical connection game on a metahex board with a minimal number of connection targets (3) where the connections are global in character (will usually go through / near the center).

3) as in Hex or Y the winning conditions for both players are mutually exclusive.

And here is a printable pdf file with a board of size 7. Of course it can also be used for other games requiring a metahex board.
