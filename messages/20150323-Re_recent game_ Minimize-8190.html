Once you get the basic tactics and "flow" of the game, the "viable tree" does start to feel relatively narrow. So I would definitely say it's more "tactical" than "strategic". But sometimes I enjoy a quick little knife fight as opposed to a big war. Variety is the spice of life right? :P

Exactly right.  Not every game has to be a strategic giant.

Im pretty sure that between the pie-rule and the slightly larger board sizes it should be able to keep people pretty entertained.

The work horse that is the pie rule has rescued many an otherwise beautiful game.  Most notably Hex.  How crappy would Hex be if Player 1 could claim, and keep, the center cell?
