The dates and geographical area for the 11th Mind Sports Olympiad have been 
announced (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.msoworld.com">http://www.msoworld.com</a>). The MSO starts on Saturday 18th August 
2007 (unfortunately clashing with The Cast Are Dice weekend near Stoke) and 
carries on throughout the week including the next weekend, finishing on bank 
holiday Monday 27th August.

The schedule of events is likely to be on the website from approx 6th May.

The venue is in Potter's Bar which is a small town with a railway station 
well connected to London's Kings Cross (15 minute journey every 30 minutes) 
very close to the M25 motorway and the A1. Very roughly 15 miles from 
Central London &amp; Luton Airport, 25 miles from Heathrow.

Expect the usual wide range of board game competitions run on the swiss 
system (no knockouts) + other mind sports events.

On a more specific note, the event will include the 5th Pacru and 2nd Azacru 
world championships, with cash prizes for both in this 5th anniversary year 
of one of the 'acrus first being played at the MSO.
