  Now notice that all 3-d pentominos can be set down to be just 2
blocks high.  So the representation scheme is:

SIDE VIEW   MY REPRESENTATION

   ##        xx#^
 ###

Get it?  This is really 2-d pentomino #6 but it illustrates how
I'm drawing things.  Now to do the 3-d pentominos:

Non-flippable: (4 total)
13. x#x  14. #x  15. xxx  16. #xx  17. x#
   x       xx        #       x        # 

Flippable: (9 total)
18. x#x  19. #xx  20. x#   21. x#  22. #x   23. xx#
   x         x        ^^      x^       xx      x  

24. #x   25. x#   26. xx#
    xx       xx        ^

  Looks like 26 pentominos, or 35 if you can't use 4 dimensions.
  This got pretty hairy, so I may have messed up...corrections/additions,
anybody?

Well, 13 and 18 look identical to me, as do 18 flipped and 19, and I don't
see the following:

  #x
  xx

There are probably duplicates and/or omissions.

Here's how I would go about classifying the 3d pentacubes (i.e. the ones
which adon't live completely in one plane): first, consider the "bounding
box" of an n-cube, which is the smallest axis-aligned box which contains it
completely. For instance, the bounding boxes of 13-16, 18-20 and 22-26 above
are 2x2x3 in size; the bounding boxes of 17 and 21 are 2x2x2 in size.

Now consider building up an n-cube one cube at a time, keeping it connected
all the time - i.e. as a sequence of a 1-cube, a 2-cube, etc. The 1-cube has
bounding box 1x1x1, and each added cube can increase at most one of the
three dimensions by at most one. So if the bounding box of an n-cube has
size axbxc, we know that a+b+c is at most n+2.

The bounding box of a non-planar n-cube must be at leat 2 in each dimension.
Putting these facts together, we see that the bounding box of a non-planar
pentacube must be either 2x2x2 or 2x2x3 in size.

Case 1: Non-planar pentacubes with 2x2x2 bounding box.

  In each dimension, the five individual cubes must be split either 2:3 or
  1:4 between the two 1x2x2 planes the 2x2x2 cube can be divided into.

  Case 1A: They split 1:4 in some dimension. So the pentacube is a square
    with a single cube on top:

      13. #x     (Symmetrical)
          xx

  Case 1B: They split 2:3 in every dimension. Take one of these three
    dimensions and assume that the bottom plane contains three cubes in a
    "triangle":

      ab
      c

    If the top plane contains a cube above "a", the remaining cube must
    either be above b or above c, and in either case, we find a 1:4 split in
    one of the other two dimensions. So the two cubes must be in two of the
    remaining three positions, leading to the following possibilities:

      x#   x#    xx
      #    x^    #^

    A little thought will show that these are all the same - we're just
    looking at them from different sides (e.g. the third one is the same as
    the first looked at from the right):

      14. x#     (Symmetrical)
          #

Case 2: Non-planar pentacubes with 3x2x2 bounding box.

  Split the bounding box up into three 1x2x2 squares along its longest
  dimension, and consider how the five cubes are split between them. After
  choosing which end to put on the left, the possibilities are 3:1:1, 1:3:1,
  2:1:2 and 2:2:1.

  Case 2A: Cubes split 3:1:1. The three cubes in the leftmost group must
    form a triangle, and in order to be connected, the two others must then
    form a straight line to its right. I.e. we must have one of the
    following:

      15. #xx    (Symmetrical)
          x

      16. #      16 flipped: #^^
          xxx                x

  Case 2B: Cubes split 1:3:1. The three cubes in the centre must form a
    triangle, and the other two must be attached to its left and right. They
    may both be attached to "right angle" of the traingle, giving us:

      17. x#x    (Symmetrical)
           x

    or only one of them may be attached to the "right angle", giving us:

      18. x#     18 flipped: x#^
           xx                 x

    or neither of them may be attached to the "right angle", giving us:

      19.  #     (Symmetrical)
          xxx

      20.  #^    20 flipped: ^#
          xx                  xx

  Case 2C: Cubes split 2:1:2. The cube in the middle layer must connect
    together a pair of cubes in each of the outside layers, and these pairs
    must "point" in different directions - otherwise, the result will be the
    planar:

      xxx
      x x

    This only leaves us:

      21. xx#    21 flipped: #xx
          x                    x

  Case 2D: Cubes split 2:2:1. The two cubes in the left layer must be
    connected together - i.e. not in the positions:

      x
      ^

    (If they were in this position, they would force the two cubes in the
    middle layer to be in the same positions, and the cube in te right layer
    would not be able to join the two groups up.) A similar argument shows
    that the two cubes in the middle layer must be connected together.

    These two connected pairs must be joined together, which leaves the
    possibilities:

      xx    x#    #x    ##
      xx    x      x

    Of these, the first and last are planar "squares" and will still be
    planar wherever we add the cube in the right layer. So only the middle
    two survive: each has two places to attach the cube in the right layer,
    and this gives us:

      22. x#x    22 flipped: #xx
          x                   x

      23. x#^    23 flipped: #x
          x                   xx

So what we've ended up with are: 12 planar pentacubes, 5 symmetrical
non-planar pentacubes, and 6 non-symmetrical non-planar pentacubes. This
gives a total count of 12+5+6 = 23 pentacubes if we don't count mirror
images as different, or 12+5+2*6 = 29 if we do.
