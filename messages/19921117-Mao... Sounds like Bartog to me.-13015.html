We have a game over here called Bartog (or bartok or barthog... no one really 
knows) which sounds a lot like Mao, from the explaination of the game given
earlier. This is how we explain Bartog to new players:
(Played with 2 or more packs of cards, jokers are wild)

Each player gets five cards each. The object of the game is to get rid of all 
your cards first. Play always starts in a clockwise direction. To play, you must
either pick up a card from the draw pile or place a card on the discard pile 
(not both). A card must match the suit or the value of the last card played. 
When you have one card left you must say "Bartog".

This is all explained during dealing, and then the dealer turns over the top 
card to start play. The following is not explained:

ANYONE may start play (first one to get a legal card down).
If anyone asks a question they are given a card.
If anyone plays out of turn they are given a card.
If anyone fails to say Bartog with one card left (and they are caught) they are
    given a card.
If anyone fails to follow any rules and is caught they are given a card.
If anyone makes a false accusation they are given a card.
If someone is deemed "Too slow" they are given a card (time is left to the 
    discretion of the other players).
Being given a card is NOT a turn... you must voluntarily TAKE one.

This all may not seem too bad at first, but play usually starts like this:
Experienced player whacks down a card, New Player says "What?", Old player says
"Question" and hands New Player a card. New Player says "Hey?", Old player says
"Question" and hands New Player a card. New Player looks mystified, Old player
says "Too slow, it's your turn." and hands New Player a card.

New Player soon learns not to ask questions.
And also, if you win a hand, you get to make up a new rule. These are usually 
split by us into card rules and action rules. Card rules get the game going, 
action rules are usually embarrassing, loud, sadistic, and a lot more fun. The
new rules, unlike Mao however, are explained, and very clearly, to all present
at the time. (Should someone join in late, however, that is entirely different.) 
Writing down the rules is simply NOT ALLOWED, and this is the first it has been
done, as far as I know. Some of our regulars or favorites are...
Simple/standard:
	Beeping on primes (Jack=11, King=13) or on evens or similar.
	Reverse on something (Aces, say)
	Skip one/two players in direction of play on something
	Accumulative draw two - say on fours: a four is played, the next player
		must then either play a four or draw 2. The first player who
		cannot play a four draws 2x(number of fours played) cards as
		their turn
	The Snap Rule: any player with the identical card can SNAP on it at any
		time and play continues from them.
	Danger Card: whoever plays this card draws three cards.
Complex:
	On a seven, any one who Beeps is given a card, until whoever played the
		last seven plays again.
	Under The Influence Rule: When some card is played, (say, King) that 
		person may not tell the truth until another person plays 
		another King, when it changes to that person. (This rule 
		"follows the card")
	Skip and reverse
	Three Word Rule: similar to Under The Influence, but the player must
		say three words only (no more, no less) at a time, with quite
		a considerable gap in between.
	Alternating beeping and quacking/woofing/similar silly noise.
	Alternating Snapping and Crackle-ing/Popping.
Embarrassing:
	Poetry; Two lines of original rhyming poetry, at least four words per
		line, delivered standing (preferably on a chair).
	Nursery Rhymes
	Movie Quotes: A movie is chosen by each player (no repetitions) and
		a different quote must be given from the same movie for the
		duration of the game. If anyone wants to change movies the 
		cost is to pick up four cards.
	General Shouting of something.
	Running/hopping somewhere and back.
	Animal Noises: person playing the card nominates an animal, next person
		to play makes the noise (try Three-Toed Sloth or Moose).
	and my favorite: Running around/up and down the room shouting "I'm king
		for a day! I'm king for a day!"
And lastly, the bloody aweful:
	The first three people to say "Bartog" have to pick up three cards. If
		you could get away without saying Bartog you still won. If you
		were caught for not saying Bartog, though, you were given four.
	Changing the base game...for example, Fives alternate the game play 
		between matching suit or value to Patience, ie value is one
		higher or lower and of opposite colour.
	The K Rule: Every word that starts with a B must be said starting with
		the letter K (ie, Keeping on primes, Kartog, or Kloody aweful).
		This is in effect at all times, including movie quotes etc.

The last two rules and a Nursery Rhyme rule, incidentally, were the first ever
to be repealed by popular/unanimous decision, the K Rule after only one round!

But, while I have outlined some of our favorites (the writer of the Mao rules
asked for some, too), the fun lies in making up your own rules. The best ones
suit the people or the place, and the best ones are also the most sadistic.
(The four of clubs is now the queen of spades).

If you want to actually end the game with a winner, Malcolm came up with what
he calls tournament rules. The winner of a hand is dealt one less card for
the duration of the game, so the winner is someone who ends up being dealt no
cards. If this moves too quickly, also implement a rule along the lines that
the player with the most cards at the end of a hand is dealt one more card
each time. These rules work exceptionally well.

I am greatly saddened that I have given away so much, but, being unable to
inflict it upon you in person, I have had to explain it all. May you get much
enjoyment from this. A game works with 4 or more people, and a fast game is a
good game... card rules first (Beep, snap, skip, reverse), then fun rules,
works best. Have fun.
