In my backgammon days, I often thought that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>doubling<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the stakes
was too much.  It meant that too quickly, a series could be decided

Even playing for money, the same applied.

That can only happen if both players repeatedly double, since the one
accepting the double gains control of the cube. If you have several
games lead, then you don't have to redouble. If you don't have a lead,
then it simply means the last game in a close match decides it. If
your lead is more than the number of games remaining, then you only
accept a double if your score in the match counts for something after
the match (say, for seeding in a tournament, or to decide who gets a
bye if you don't have a perfectly balanced set of brackets)
