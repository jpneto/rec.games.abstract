We can't all be perfect, but how exactly did you discover the
[Monkey Queen] mechanism? A mail I received on Jan. 6,
2011 may shed some light on that:

Hi Christian,

My new "stacking" (?) game bears an obvious resemblance
to your Monkey Trap. As a tribute, I wanted to call it Monkey
Queen.

Monkey Queen bears an obvious, yet superficial, resemblance to your Monkey
Trap, Christian.  Why are you claiming credit for my game?  Really bizarre,
considering you continually denigrate Monkey Queen when you're not claiming
credit for it.

Christian, your original name for Monkey Trap was Turd - a vastly more
appropriate name for what you yourself have described as a children's game.
 Essentially, in Turd, when you move a monkey, you leave a monkey turd
behind - a blanked out, unrevisitable square.  When someone's monkey bogs
down amid all the monkey turds, they lose.

For both architecture and quality of play, there's zero comparison between
Turd and Monkey Queen.  None of your games has ever provided the slightest
degree of inspiration for me, Christian.  Least of all, Turd, though I was
obligated to acknowledge the superficial similarity.  It's called integrity.


Imagine if you had integrity, Christian.  You'd credit Don Green for his
game, Snail Trail, which precedes but is virtually identical to Turd.  But
no, you didn't do that.  You snatched Snail Trail and ran off with it like a
mangy dog.

There's no mention of Don Green or Snail Trail in your Turd rule sheet,
though you do mention an "obvious affinity" with the highly regarded Amazons
by Walter Zamkauskas, rofl   And now you claim that "your" game paved the
way for Monkey Queen!  What an ass!!

Christian, you've freely admitted in the past that you're originality
challenged.  Oppositely, I'm known for my original designs, including Monkey
Queen - the superficial similarity with your Turd notwithstanding.  Posing
yourself in chain of design between Walter Zamkkauskas and me with your
grossly unoriginal Turd isn't fooling anyone.

Stop claiming credit for Monkey Queen.  I can't stand people edging onto my
coattails.
