Is there a name for this fairness levelling procedure?
It goes way beyond any kind of pie.

It's a pie, not on a particular opening move, but on an opening
position.
In progongued play and with increasing level of play, players can
study certain set-ups in deep, so that they're able to handle both
sides of it. I don't think there's a name for it, but Swish and
Squeeze were the first games I used it in. I'm not sure if I've ever
encountered it anywhere else, but it doesn't seem a very far fetched
procedure and there are thousands of games.

First of all I would have second thoughts about an initial position
with men in the corners, but if so I'd probably choose to move first.
But a single in the corner isn't wholly trapped: move a double on top
and leave as a triple. In fact trapping singles on the edge is a good
way to saddle the opponent up with time consuming liberation moves.

Of course there may be players who fix a final destination (by making
a stack of 4 or higher) while leaving a single on the wrong diagonal
subgrid. Those are not bright players.
It's also possible to make two stacks of 4. Stupidity is legal ;-)
