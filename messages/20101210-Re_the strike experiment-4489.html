There's another thing mr. Bu Zhidao xian sheng.

I never offended you, and I address you personally.
You only address my 'offensive behaviour' in answer to posts of
others.

You never addressed any of my games, but that may be because you're
"just
unqualified to make" any such statements.
That at least would be consistent.

May be its because I choose what to comment about one cannot legislate 
what people our to chose to write about, though your behaviour (see 
below) suggests you may have a tendency to want to do that. Your 
gratuitous insertion of insult into an apparently serious answer was 
worthy of being corrected. I chose to correct it. Furthermore, if you 
read what I said, you will see that everyone who had contributed to the 
mud-slinging was included in what I wrote, though some were only 
explicitly named. You yourself seem to have a high esteem of yourself, 
which is certainly distasteful for me to see you comment on (respect and 
true worth is measured by how modest people are in not elevating 
themselves constantly above others, which is something you never seem to 
be shy at doing.) It is matched only by your prima-donna-like leaving of 
the recre.games.combinatorial list just because you were not being given 
the attention and adoration you obviously felt you deserved is. Respect 
should be earned, and you have not yet, in my eyes, earned it in the 
area of interacting with people, given your comments and siding with 
Mark Steere in the previous exchanges.

And, by the way, if you do want to be (falsely) formal in your dealings 
with me, it would be PROFESSOR Bu Zhidao, rather than the entirely 
incorrect form you used (what you wrote was, in fact, "Mr Mr Don't 
Know") As for being "unqualified to make any comments", that is just 
another example of your own high assessment of your own abilities. Karl 
Popper in his book "The Open Society and Its Enemies" quoted a very 
important sentiment attributed to Pericles of Athens, and it roughly 
states that "although only a few may initiate something, all may comment 
on it" but, of course, it is not required that everyone MUST comment on 
it. However, the sense of your own self-importance you show is 
completely consistent with you flouncing out of recre.games. 
combinatorial in such a public way just because people chose not to 
instantly comment on your posts, as if they were engraved in gold in 
tablets of stone, or some other such conceit you seem to have.

In short: good designer of games; but problems in dealing with other 
people, especially when he feels he is not being given the attention he 
(unduly) feels is instantly demanded towards him from others.
