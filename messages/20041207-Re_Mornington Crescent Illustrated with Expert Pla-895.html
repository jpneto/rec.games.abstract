Surely Minski's 'sausage' manoeuvre, after which ASIV reduces to one of
eleven solvable configurations [see note] once Shaved Ape is forced, is
usable in almost any variation that employs the Oblong or 'Bismarck'
rule?  It may not win, but it could be unbalancing, because whoever
comes out strongest in underpass (or its equivalent) may be able to take
on a so-called 'kingmaker' role.

The correct term for the manoeuvre in question is in fact the "Wiener"
manoeuvre, which Minski named in honour of the mathematician Ludwig
Christian Wiener (1826-1896). Wiener's two volume book on geometry (Lehrbuch
der darstellenden Geometrie) greatly influenced Minski's own thinking, and
it was Wiener's patterns that Minksi developed and applied to Mornington
Crescent. Wiener's younger brother Jurgen Hambrecht Wiener later settled in
Vienna and established the butcher shop that developed the famous German
sausage of the same name. Minksi's family became shareholders in the
company, which could lend legitimacy to Minski's claim about receiving
half-eaten sausages in the post, although this could equally be the result
of the early onset of psychotic delusions.
