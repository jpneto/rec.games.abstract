Gyre: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Gyre_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Gyre_rules.pdf</a>

Gyre came to me years ago and for some reason I didn't release it.  I may have suspected Gyre vulnerable to first turn advantage because, as in many games, center cell ownership confers an advantage.  And I may have thought the pie rule insufficient to balance the game.  But I recently revisited Gyre and toyed with it on a base 5 board - using the pie rule.   Note: I haven't actually play tested Gyre in the usual sense of playing on a larger board and concentrating on one's moves.  Btw, people have complained to me about my releasing games without having play tested them first.  I made them waste their precious time playing my (free) game only to realize it wasn't what they expected.  How absurd.  As though I have a moral obligation to spoon feed greedy retards.  If you're so fearful of wasting a precious moment of your beautiful life playtesting my game, fuck off.

Anyway, it seems to me, from my cursory perusal of Gyre gameplay, that the pie rule may even out the game.  I.e. there should be equitable first moves available.  Just as in Hex, first move values will be more finely graded and more equitable on larger boards.  

If Gyre does turn out to have some issue, I'm sure someone will gleefully point it out.  I don't expect to hear from Nick though.  He's been pretty busy crusading to dispel black stereotypes.  And who better to represent black people than Nick Bentley.  [?]  Of course he's in cahoots with Joe, who believes that "we're all the same" because, on a scale of modern primates, humans are all squished together.  Not super complimentary.  Like, "We're practically equal because you're a lot different from a lower primate."  Gee, thanks... 

Gyre is kind of Hex-like, kind of Y-like.  Kind of.  They're remotely similar.  But the Gyre board is super clean.  Absent are the colored edges of Hex and the orientation they mandate.  Absent are the corner cells of Y and the pre-designated perimeter segments they demarcate.  Gyre obviates all that by making the center cell "something to surround."  There's more freedom in Gyre.  

There are no missing board cells or any other aesthetic Hiroshimas in Gyre.  There's no math.  When somebody wins you know it.  Check your calculator at the door.

Gyre is super simple.  So simple that I'm a little worried someone else already thought of it.   Yet I have hope because there's only one me.
