hello anyone,

 as there is some talk about Chinese Chess (Xianqi), I wonder, whether there
are still more Chess variants - I only know Shogi and Xianqi as real chess 
variants, but I recently heard about "Korean Chess" - does such a variant truly 
exist or is it only another style of playing Chess (or Xianqi, Shogi) itself?

Also - I once asked for a rules on Xianqi, I got some, but there was no 
description of the move notation for the game. I now saw some games postings 
with a form of notation, that I seemingly didn't quite understand - perhabs 
someone can mail me another rules text that includes a description of the 
notation. (Currently I play Xianqi with a guy in "Vervan's Gaming Network" 
newsgroup V_CHESS and we use the common chess notation to exchange our moves. 
But - if these aren't the right form of notation, we want to switch over to the 
right ones then (just to learn a bit more about Xianqi).

yours,

      Benedikt

There truly exists a Korean Chess. It is called JANG-GI and uses the same
board and pieces with completely different rules, not just minor modifications.
Since I do not know the proper terms in English, I will just improvise as I
go along.

MOVEMENT OF THE PIECES:

KING: he is confined in his castle like Xianqi, but he can move like queen in
chess. If I don't specify how the piece captures, it captures as it moves.

GUARDS: they move like the King.

CHARIOTS: they move like their counter parts in Xianqi.

KNIGHTS: they move like their counter parts in Xianqi.

FOOT-SOLDIERS: they move like their counter parts in Xianqi, except with one
difference: they move as if they already crossed the river (1 unit sideways and
forward) Also when they arrive at the castle, they can move diagonally 
following the diagonal line. But they can never move backwards.

ELEPHANS: they move just like the Knights except they move diagonally one more
square. So one typical move would be: 1 unit-length forward, 1 unit-length left
diagonal, 1 unit-length left-diagonal. Think of it as extended Knight.

CANNONS: they move ALWAYS by jumping over other pieces. They can capture on 
landing just like in Xianqi. But they always move by jumping. So if there is
no piece to jump over, they can be stranded in the middle of the board. The
cannons can NEVER jump over each other or the enemy cannons. So one cannon
cannot be used as a jumping stone for the other cannon. Since one cannon cannot
jump over the fellow cannon or the enemy's cannon, they act as natural blockades
to each other's attack. A cannon can NEVER capture another cannon.

GENERAL RULES:

	Kings cannot face each other. That is to say if I move the king to 
another point and the other king happens to be on the same vertical line and
there is NO SCREENING PIECE between them, then my opponent must do something
about it. He can either move his king out of the way or put another piece
to screen himself.

	The initial position of the pieces are nearly identical to Xianqi
except for two things:
1) the King is at the center of the castle, not tucked away between the 
guards.
2) the positions of the elephants and knights can be exchanged. For example,
I can have elephant,knight on my left side and elephant, knight on my right
side or I can have knight, elephant on left and elephant, knight on right just
like Xianqi etc. There is some rule about this but unless I consult the book 
on Korean Chess, I am not sure how to regulate this.

	I think there is a stalemate when the mate is not possible. But I 
think one counts the value points of each remaining piece, and the one who
has more points wins. Also if one cannot move his King, that does not mean
STALEMATE. He just has to relinquish his turn. Also when the position is repeated,
I think there is a stalemate. The reason for my uncertainity is because Korean
Chess has not yet be rigorously defined. I do have some books on it but never
had the time to read them.

	Anyway, anyone familiar with Xianqi can play pretty quickly because
I learned to play Xianqi from a Vietnemese friend, and he learned to play
Korean Chess from me. We were able to play both styles with equal fluency.

	The notation uses Chinese characters for each piece and it is similar
to Algebraic notation of Chess.

	Anyway, that's it for now. I will post further or answer any questions
regarding Korean Chess if there is any enquiry about it.
