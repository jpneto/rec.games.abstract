the problem is you can't just shit out an idea and expect people to care. How about formatting or something? I'm pretty sure someone sees a post by pederast frog Hazen Abouricha and thinks to themselves "there's that annoying fly again" and either rightly ignores the post altogether or reads the confusing text and doesn't care to actually discern what the fly is buzzing about this time because its just a fly and nobody has ever had any fun playing a Hazen Abouricha game.

When you start personal insults without knowing the person then that means I touched some sensitive nerve on you.
You are crappy and huge plagiarist "game designer" (I can prove it).
You are dumb (no need to prove it).
People who what a good game is they run to program it to play it.
I know that many of my games are played. I do not need to promote my game and to beg for them like you and Luis or Christian the big plagiarist who invented nothing and who is trying to promote his games through a website.
To finish I do care about people like you even read my games. 
Why then do you read my games?
Why then do you plagiarize my ideas?
That is not the first time that you did it.
Cartezero!!! ha ha ha
I`m banned from bgg otherwise I will make you and Luis look like what you are in fact : plagiarist and incompetent "designers".
