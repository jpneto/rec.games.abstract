Countermoves Volume 1 Issue 3 ( Spring/Summer 2002 ) is now sitting in
the Files Section

(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=58081">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=58081</a> )

This issue is packed full of great game goodness. There is a run down
on the results of the Microgames Design Contest 2002 as well as the
game that took First Place, Operation Whirlwind by Brain Train. Walt
O'Hara checks in with some variants for The Illuminati as well as the
solutions to last issue's WordFind. There is a double dose of Trevor
Blake, an article on using coins for dice and a public domain chess
rules. Devlyn Davis has a stinky game of dice for kids called Skunk.
Of course there are this issue's installment of the Tech Deck, various
words from yours truly as well as some graphical fun.

There are two version to choose from. The Print Ready version is all
set to be sent to your printer; print odd pages on one side, even
pages on the other..even without a duplex printer this is a snap. The
Display Ready version is for viewing on your screen, that is the pages
flow sequentially as opposed to the Print Ready printer ready
sequence.

Either way they are there for you to read , enjoy. Issue 4 should be
here by the end of December
