Hi,

This a new game designed to be played on computer.

Mobius solitaire game.

You take an urn with 100 balls numbered from 1 to 100.
You start picking randomly one ball noted k(1) :
- you compute v=mu(k(1)) where mu() is the Mobius function
- if v=0 then you reput the picked ball on the urn
- if v=1 you place a new ball numbered (max(A)+1) where is the balls remaining on the urn and put aside the ball with v=1
- if v=-1 you choose "smartly" one ball from the urn and you replace it by the ball just picked v=-1

You do the process until you empty completely the urn.
If you play smartly how many picks do you need in the worst case to empty the urn?

Example :

URN : 1,2,3,......,100 
Pick 1 : k(1)=15 then v=mu(15)=1 as the max(A)=100 you place a new ball numbered 101 on the urn and remove from the game the b all numbered 15
Pick 2 : k(2)=4 then v=mu(4)=0 you put the picked ball 4 on the urn 
Pick 3 : k(3)=7 then v=mu(7)=-1 you need to choose one ball from the remaining balls 
URN contains :1,2,3,...,14,16,17,....,100,101 (15 was removed and 101 was added)
Let us say that removing a ball with v=0 is "smart" choice (if is up to the player to choose the best strategy not me). So you remove the ball 8 (v=0)
and so on 
       
Enjoy! 

The first one who programs the game will receive a big thank you from me.
You could only with 10 balls ans see if you could empty the urn.
If you succeed increase the number of balls.
