Luigi, it's still sinking in how phenomenal Rive's stone recycling factor
is.  If someone showed me Rive, I'd think it had been engineered
specifically to maximize the recycling factor. Of course I know better.  I
stumbled onto Rive haphazardly.

Rive's recycling factor must be near a theoretical limit.  Could you imagine
Rive on a Go sized board?  Just the number of moves would be...  in the tens
of thousands?  Millions?  I don't know.  There seems to be a geometric
increase in the recycling rate with increasing board size.  Go-sized Rive's
game tree would make Go's game tree look like Tic-Tac-Toe's in comparison.
