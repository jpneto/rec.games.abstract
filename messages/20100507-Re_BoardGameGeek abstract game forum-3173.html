Rich, Iago is not a metagame.  You are not admired by anyone, with the

I'm not sure I even know Rich, so don't know upon what you're basing
that assertion. One might say that I do generally admire anyone who's
contributed to the field of promoting the playing of games of skill,
specifically for those contributions. Heavens, I even admire your
actual contributions, despite the fact that as a human being you are
intollerable.

Mark has very good designs.  I respect his designs.  A problem faced
here is that the world doesn't really care that Mark has good
designs.  That is a problem.  People who do designs like Mark aren't
able to make a living doing them.  The games are given away for free.
Even if Mark was much more of an agreeable personality, he still
couldn't make a living doing it.

In this, what IAGO started as was myself going out and trying to make
a difference, and calling others, to be something that would grow and
eventually end up not being me, but others.  It started as the one guy
in the house, dealing with the sheer and utter madness of trying to
get people to agree and work together to get greater interest in
abstract strategy games, and accomodating as wide of a definition as
possible. I had tried to defer and so on to people, and did get a lot
of grief about it.  Anyhow, the issues still remain, but fortunately I
am not alone in this at this point (Multiple signatures were needed to
sign on to get it incorporated in NY state).  To this end, I AGO
should outlive everyone here, and hopefully become an organization
which can maybe get on par with FIDE some day, but not with all the
issues involved.

Anyhow, I don't care if I am admired or hated.  I just want people to
do whatever would work to get people to care more and coordinate and
not conflict.  I personally would like to see people be positive and
respect others and help lift others so they themselves get lifted
(like, it is ok to speak well about what other people do, and hold
harshness against things that other people like, but you don't).  To
this end, IAGO is meant to be a tool, and that is it.  And the idea is
to get results, rather than just talk or defend some sort of purity.
As for myself, I can STFU if people like, if it helps.  I likely will
end up being elsewhere on here, unless something of note is posted.  I
actually just visited now to explain why I saw Boardgame Geek as
something that is important to the discussion of abstracts and
abstract strategy games.

By the way, what happened to this newsgroup?  I know it used to be
more busy.  Now it seems to be fewer and far between.  It looks now
mostly a place for one person to dump their thoughts and game designs.
