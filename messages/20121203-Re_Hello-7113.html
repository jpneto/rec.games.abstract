Yep, Ayu's a good one. Many of us are hoping Luis will win with one game or another. 

Congratulations on your winnings.  Now you can retire from butchering and design more games.  

Mainly, don't be discouraged by Christian Freeling's abominations.  Believe it or not, Christian was a good designer once, many many years ago. But now his philosophy is "Life is futile, so what's the difference?"  Yes, I suppose life is futile in some sense, but you still have to try.  You can't just throw in the towel on finitude and aesthetics.
