Maybe you can figure out some tricky positions while you're fucking
yourself, Vintershitz.

Dedication?  Here, let my try and put it all in perspective for you,
Vintershitz.  You really want to know why I find Trax annoying?  Trax
was the most over promoted game in the history of mankind.  There was
a period of a few years where every time you turn around,

ONLY 200 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE NEXT TRAX TOURNAMENT!!!!
ONLY 199 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE NEXT TRAX TOURNAMENT!!!!
ONLY 198 DAYS LEFT ...

Then at the end of it all, 6 people show up for the fucking
tournament, including the initiator of this thread.  Then comes the
stunning announcement.  So-and-so wins the tournament for the nth year
in a row.  Congratulations!  There were like 5 other people in the
fucking tournament!  Holy shit!!

Of the 15 sites my games are played at, how many of them do you think
have Trax?  Two!!  You think I'm jealous of Trax because a handful of
people bought into the hype and someone compiled a puzzle
collection??  Guess again, moron.

Here's a quote from the "official" Trax site: "One of the unique
features of TRAX is that it has the potential to be played to
infinity."  Vintershitz, if you've listened to a word I've said over
the years, you'd know I couldn't possibly admire a game like that.
There are a small number of games I do admire, including Forms by
Steven W. Meyers and Metamorphosis by Greg van Patten.  Trax isn't one
of them, idiot.

As one of the guys who has challenged the great So-and-so Trax player
I have to admit that it's a marvellous game. I'm not sure why someone
would like to comment on a post about a puzzle collection only to say
that he doesn't like the game. I'm sure there are millions who do not
like the game. Perhaps thousands who know it and love it. Maybe
millions who would like it if they knew it. I really don't think
anybody cares if someone doesn't like Chess or Go. Nor does that makes
Chess or Go inferior. So what?

    ypercube
 just a average Trax player.

P.S. Keep up the good work, Traxplayer. We are waiting for more
puzzles  :)
