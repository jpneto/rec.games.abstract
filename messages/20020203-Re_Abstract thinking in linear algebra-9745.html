It depends on the linear algebra course.  Nowadays many of them are
just about as cookbook as most calculus courses.  Others spend a good
deal of time on abstract vector spaces and have you studying (and
possibly even proving) general theorems about them.

Thats a good point, at my school (BU if any one cares) there are two
different linear algebra courses (in fact most of the math classes are
structured like this).  there is a normal section that is concerned mainly
with applications of the math to engineering and applied science and less
concerned with proofs and abstract theory.  The people who take these
classes are almost exclusively applied science majors (like me) or
engineers.  There is also an "honors" section that follows a much more
rigorous and theoretical curriculum.  these classes are full of math majors
and inquisitive non-math majors.  I've never understood why some schools
didn't adopt this plan.
