Though there are limitless variations of Mancala games,
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>WARI<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is easily the most common. It is played with
slight variations in number of holes and number of stones
in many countries.

Wari is the version of Mancala I've seen most often 
played in my travels, and it is the version most often 
given in the many books on games I've read.

The board is 2x6 holes. The six holes next to you are
yours; the other six belong to your opponent. To start
with, there are 4 stones in each hole. There may or may
not be a larger 'store' for the players to store their
captured stones. If not, just set the captured stones aside.


                        The Starting Position

Four stones in each of       f e d c b a  &lt;---Labels
your opponents holes,  ---&gt;  4 4 4 4 4 4
and in your holes.     ---&gt;  4 4 4 4 4 4
                             A B C D E F  &lt;---Labels


Players take turns 'sowing' the stones taken from one of
their own holes. That is, she or he lifts all the stones
from one of the holes and drops them one at a time, counter-
clockwise in the holes around the board. If there are 12 or
more stones in the hole, skip the hole you lifted the stones
from. (You have a choice of at most 6 different moves each
turn in this version!)

For example, if on your first move you choose hole 'E', the
resulting position would be:

                           f e d c b a
                           4 4 4 5 5 5
                           4 4 4 4 - 5
                           A B C D E F

If the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>last<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> stone lands in your own hole, or in an opponents
hole that is empty or has 3 or more stones, you do not capture 
any stones, and your turn ends.

If the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>last<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> stone lands in one of your opponents holes and
brings the total stones in that hole to 2 or 3, you capture all
the stones in that last hole AND, in addition, all preceding 
holes in an unbroken sequence on the opponents side of the board 
that now contain 2 or 3 stones are also captured. (You only 
capture stones on your opponents side of the board.) This 
method of capture is referred to as "capturing by 2's and 3's."


For example, if it   You could move     and capture the
is your turn and     from 'D,'          stones in 'a' and
the board looked                        'b', leaving the
like this:                              board like this:

  f e d c b a         f e d c b a        f e d c b a
  1 1 2 3 1 1         1 1 2 3 2 2        1 1 2 3 - -
  - - - 4 7 2         - - - - 8 3        - - - - 8 3
  A B C D E F         A B C D E F        A B C D E F



Or, from the same     You could move      and capture the
position,             from 'E',           stones in d, e,
                                          and f.                                                                                    too many.

  f e d c b a         f e d c b a         f e d c b a
  1 1 2 3 1 1         2 2 3 4 2 2         - - - 4 2 2
  - - - 4 7 2         - - - 4 - 3         - - - 4 - 3
  A B C D E F         A B C D E F         A B C D E F



Or, if you managed    You could only      and capture the
to get yourself in-   move from 'F':      stones in b, c,
to this position:                         d, e and f!                                                                               too many.

  f e d c b a         f e d c b a         f e d c b a
  1 - 1 - 1 2         3 2 3 2 3 4         - - - - - 4
  - - - - - 17        1 1 1 1 1 -         1 1 1 1 1 - 
  A B C D E F         A B C D E F         A B C D E F


If it is your turn and all your opponents holes are empty,
you must play into them if you can. But if you can't the
game is over and you get all the stones left on the board.

If you capture all your opponents remaining stones,
leaving him or her nothing to play, the game is over, and
you get all the remaining stones.

If you capture more than half of all the stones, you win.
If neither of you can capture more than half and the other
stones are just going round and round with no progress, it
is a draw -- whether you both have the same number of captured
stones or not.


Common variations change the number of holes or number of
stones used. Also, some change the number required for capture
from 2's and 3's -- e.g. 2's and 4's, 1's and 3's, 2's and 3's
and 4's, etc. (This completely changes the strategy.) Other 
variations give more scope for skill by allowing the player
to sow clockwise or counter-clockwise by choice. Other games
allow you to capture holes in addition to the stones in them.


Many Mancala games are played with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Multiple Laps<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. For
instance, the games described by Mark Basset and Jonathan 
Kapleau in this thread are nearly identical to a multiple lap 
game we played as kids. The only additional rule is that if 
your last stone lands in ANY non-empty hole, on your side or 
your opponents side, you continue your turn by picking up
all the stones in THAT hole and continuing sowing. Your turn
only ends when your last stone ends up in an empty hole.
Each time you pick up the stones from a hole is a LAP, hence
the term multiple lap. (A more common variation is to sow 
only to the holes, not to the stores as Mark describes.
This completely changes the game.)

Multiple lap games are really confusing in the beginning. 
(I don't know if it is an accepted variation, but we would 
allow the player to sow either direction on every lap, greatly 
increasing the number of moves to choose from per turn.)


I believe the games that Mark and Jonathon describe, Wari and 
their close variations are the most often played and written 
about, at least as far as I've seen in the US and the Caribbean. 
Again, I recommend tracking down a copy of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Mancala Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> if 
you want to play the more complicated 3 and 4 row games. 


And if anybody wants to play any version at all by email, just
send me your chosen rules and the board position after your
first move.
