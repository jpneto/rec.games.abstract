	That is all there is.  I am interested in teaching my computer
to play this game.  I was wondering what sort of thoughts people had on
algorithms/strategies for this game.  I have not been able to play very 
effectively yet, but I am working on it 8^).

As it happens, I am working on a program to play Hex as part of my
dissertation work.  It seems to be very difficult to make a computer
play Hex well.  The standard methods used for chess programs are pretty
feeble for Hex, compared to the reasoning power of us human players.

Does anybody know about any other Hex programs, or articles about
Hex algorithms?  If so, please mail me about them.

As I remember, it doesn't even take a computer; someone constructed a pretty
good hex machine back when computer size was measured in refrigerator units
(RU's) with a pretty simple algorithm.  Can't remember who was telling me
about it though.
