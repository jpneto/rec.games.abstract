The positive thing of Redstone is that it's more or less
Go without cycles.

That's a victory, considering the two Go experts were initially
convinced that Redstone was "random" and "tedious".  I was hoping for
this outcome.  Now I'm wondering how the quality of play compares
between the two games.

Final comments from the two players:

"And Mark, I want to eat both my words and my hat, that was fun, deep
and interesting!"

"I admit that my initial impressions were off - the variant is quite
interesting, though confusing."

I'm feeling pretty good about Redstone right now.  Solid, solid Go
variant.
