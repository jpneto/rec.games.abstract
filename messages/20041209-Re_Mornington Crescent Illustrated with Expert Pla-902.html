I recall a Christmas Lecture by Dr. Humphrey Nagle [I think 1998, but it
could be as late as 2000] in which he did a sort of retrospective on
Smith, and was quite scathing about some of the early material.  As he
put it [I quote from memory] "Some of the Egyptian gods mentioned by
Smith, such as the Crocodile god Ghobla, or Pniht the Small-Headed god,
would be more at home in the 'Discworld' of Mr. Terry Pratchett, than in
the Ptolemaic Pantheon."  Pratchett was not perhaps so well-known at the
time, and the reference went over the head of many - but for those who
were familiar with his stories, it was very amusing!  Dr. Nagle also
discerned similarities between Smith's Egyptian chapter and some of the
works of Erik Von Daniken...

You must be mistaken.  Dr. Humphrey Nagle died of complications resulting
from a liposuction surgical procedure to remove fat from his abdomen in
1996.  One of his graduate students, Joseph Farnarkle, looked somewhat like
his mentor, and was known to appear in public disguised as Dr. Nagle and
even make speeches on his behalf.  The Christmas Lecture you heard must have
been delivered by the imposter Farnarkle, which naturally undermines the
credibility of its contents.
