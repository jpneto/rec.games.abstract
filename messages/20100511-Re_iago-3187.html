e) "local knowledge" of the set being played with (again for when

a) No visual judgment is needed if you know the pieces - and it's not
unreasonable to demand that a player knows the pieces before playing a
game.

b) c) d) and e) are implementation issues. You could avoid them almost
completely by building a special, high-quality set - or you could take
them completely away with a computer implementation. The idea of the
game is abstract, but you could say the concrete implementation
isn't.

Most people don't mind. Mark Steere minds because he's jealous of the
guy who made it.
