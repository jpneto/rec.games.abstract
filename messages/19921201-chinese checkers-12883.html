Anyone interested in discussing chinese checkers?

This is a fairly simple game, and the strategies I've always
used when playing it are also pretty simple.  But the game 
feels as though it OUGHT to be possible to develop more 
sophisticated strategies, especially in a 2-person game, where
one has more control than in, say, a 6-person game.  

Does anyone know of published discussions of this game?  Does 
anyone have their own ideas on what constitutes a winning 
strategy?

An interesting feature to chinese checkers as opposed to many 
other games is that whatever you do for yourself, you also 
do for your opponent.  For example, if you construct a long
ladder that lets you jump across the board, your opponent 
may also use your ladder to jump across the board.  Or, if
you place your pieces so as to block your opponent, the pieces
you block will also block your own pieces.  It is this reciprocity,
I think, which makes it difficult to construct a strategy which 
keeps an advantage for yourself without conferring an equal 
advantage on your opponent.  Or is there a way to avoid this?
