For the record I'm fine with Redstone discussion. Though reading about who should get credit for what isn't maybe the most fun thing to read about. 

Christian: I wasn't aware of Charybdis (you have a lot of games in your pocket).  Just read the rules. I'll try to get a play-through in soon. 

As for Shello: 

I agree that Othello's opacity can be overcome. More than one book has been written on Othello strategy, there are lots of tournaments, and the best players play at a really high level. 

My issue is really that it's hard to get to the point where you can see into the game enough to grasp strategy. There's this cliff you have to scale before you can get to the interesting stuff. I like it better when strategy insight builds incrementally, right from when you start playing, like steps in a staircase.
