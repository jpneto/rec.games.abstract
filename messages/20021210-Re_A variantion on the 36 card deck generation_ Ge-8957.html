In other other words, I wouldn't trust a d7 made as a pentagonal prism
to be fair.  I would, personally, construct a d7 as a d14 (similar to
a d10) with 1-7 twice each.  Using a d28 or higher seems OTT, and
these are the only other possibilities of a provably fair (as opposed
to probably fair) d7.

Well, there's also the right heptagonal prism, rolled in the natural
way so that it only lands on its rectangular (fairly long and thin
would be best) faces. Of course then its an edge upwards, but use
the modern d4 approach to labelling here. Practically fair, if not
a theoretical fair die (provided rolled far enough).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True.  If you round the ends, it can't land on these and becomes a
true d7.  I didn't count this, as I considered only polyhedrons that
can rest on all faces, which dice need not necessarily be.  You could,
for example make a d7 as a 7-sided pyramid with a rounded base, so the
die can't rest on this.  This has the same problem of having an edge
on top, but you could put the numbers on the base.  This makes it
essentialy a tee-totum.  Still, I would prefer a d14 as described
above.

But your way is better (much better) of course. However prisms
have been used - Owzatt! (ultra-crude "cricket" game) and other
games by the same publisher for example (which had metal prisms
- with 6 sides used as I recall).

And the Romans used dice that were four-sided prisms with small
pyramids at the ends to prevent resting on these.
