I have an interest in abstract games, though they aren't the game of
choice for me, I admit.  I do like looking at pure mechanics, though,
which is what I consider abstract games to be.  You can then add flavor
as you wish: add space ships and aliens, and you have an SF game; add
wizards and elves and you have a fantasy game; add panzers or cavalry and
you have a wargame; call your points money and you have a market game,
etc.  So I consider it worthwhile to look at abstract games.

I'm curious about how many abstract games are available commercially.

Here (alphabetically) are ones I personally own, aside from things like
chess, checkers and go:

4th Dimension
Abalone
Arcadia
Icehouse
Kaliko 
King's Table
Lemma
Plateau
Scoozie
Timeline
Void

If you count random elements in a game as still belonging on this board,
then I also have, in addition to Backgammon,

G.O.O.T.M.U.
Nieuchess

I know of many other abstract games, but would like those who own them to
list what they have.

I'd be happy to discuss any of the games above, BTW.
