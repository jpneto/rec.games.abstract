Yes, this is surely the key to being a great game!

I would say not opague, but concealing.  The game must be easy
to play and to understand how to play, at each level of expertise,
(so that second point goes to maintain clarity), but that nonetheless
a good player is beaten by a great player with the same
"WTF happened" feeling that occurs when he beats a poor player!

IMHO, Go and Dots&amp;Boxes are at the top end of this.

OTOH, some games admit many levels of expertise, but are
quite a bit opaque at almost every level.  IMHO Reversi is
the classic example of this.  I am now quite a good player of this,
but I still have no real idea of what I'm doing or why, even though
I beat lesser players with the same cavalier ease with which better
players beat me.

When I lose at Go and D&amp;B, I know (after the event) exactly WHY
I lost; but after a Reversi loss I am completely in the dark!

IMHO, these anecdotes go a long way to describe how
the opacity/clarity dichotomy is more or less orthognal to
the depth/shallowness one.

In great part, but not entirely.   The winning method of
the poor player over the very poor one is QUITE clear to both!

Yes, very much so.

 Another point may apply here.  If the game is clear, but deep,
it is still possible for the better player to TEACH the lesser one,
out-of-game, by verbal help or by books.  This is very much
the case at Go, at every level.

But I have found it to be very much NOT the case at Reversi.
Apart from the very vague "try to stay internal and keep
the opponent on the outside", there is little I can ever teach
a poorer player, or learn from a better one. It is VERY frustrating!

The existence of very extensive and indispensable "opening books"
is another strongly significant piece of evidence for opacity at many
levels.

These are fascinating matters!
