Ok, what it sounds like what you are raising here is, how can chess
have a scoring system that can enable people who don't follow it to
quickly tell who is ahead.

Do it like they do in televised poker: A computer evaluation of
who is ahead is put on screen for the viewers, but cannot be seen

That is part of it.  If Chess were shown on TV, then it would be done
reality TV editing stype, complete with compression of time, and
scoring.  The issue is exactly what kind of scoring should be used?
Should it be a mix of computer analysis and art that puts up
percentages like they do with poker and backgammon, based on analysis
after the fact?   Or should something else be used?  Can there be less
time to play, and the clock be shown on how many seconds are left, so
that the clock will fall instead of a draw?  This is the issue
regarding the scoring system that needs to be resolved.
