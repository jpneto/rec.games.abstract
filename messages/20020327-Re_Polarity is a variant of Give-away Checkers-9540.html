Perhaps a solution would be to have just 4 positive pieces, but 8 negative
pieces per player. Then both goals might be equally feasible. Could you
imagine a set-up?

There is probably a number of ways to change Polarity to offset the relation of
the positive and negative pieces.  The problem is, in the end, you'd wind up
with a game that was quite different from what you started with.  And that's
not what I want.

If you're looking for a comparable game, a few months ago I came across a
Checkers variant by V. R. Parton that is very similar in concept to Polarity. 
It is called "Good-for-Nothings."  The front two ranks are filled with regular
pieces (like positive pieces) and the back rank is filled with
Good-for-Nothings (like negative pieces).  The player wins either by capturing
all of his opponents regular pieces, getting rid of all his own
Good-for-Nothings, or forcing an opponent's Good-for-Nothing to promote.
