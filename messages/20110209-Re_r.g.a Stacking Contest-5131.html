I'm sure you don't want to win a contest slanted against Monkey Queen, yet
after the apparent group consensus that a judge panel would be the fairest
solution, you continue to press for a public vote slanted in your favor.

That just is not true, so why do you say so.
In answer to Corey's suggestion regarding a jury of three I said:
"For this year's contest I agree, though I must politely refrain from
any suggestions."

In answer your post I said:
"Let's wait on the verdict regarding the expert jury."
and:
"I think we should discuss the procedure for future contests though."

Is the contest some glorified marketing stunt geared to "target an audience"?
A goal so important that we have to subvert the contest in your favor?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Same here, I never suggested to subvert, I was under the impression we
had a public vote to begin with. I even entered Grabber because of its
easy accessability. And why not, that's a thing to consider.

I never objected to an expert jury, and I won't object to any decision
made, so what is your problem? The mere existence of public votes?

May I also remind you that I supported the contest by posting its
progress at LG and Arimaa and MindSports, while you were mainly
glorifying Monkey Queen.

Finally, Greg has implemented Grabber for the Axiom Engine and wrote:
"Very nice game! Clever too. The "scalp the opponent" mechanic works
very well and I enjoy the back and forth stack deflating moves. For
me, it's a puzzle-like game of maximizing mobility. I'm really getting
a sense and appreciation for the game now that I've played it. I will
be playing it some more even though the computer beats me badly. Nice
work!"

I appreciate Greg's efforts highly and I'm glad he found the game
worthy of them :)
