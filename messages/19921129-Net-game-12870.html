Hello r.g.a-er's,

Does anyone of you know if the following "game" has been invented/tried
already? I'm not proposing to play it here or anything like that, just
curious. I'll give a net-version:

Assume we have a newsgroup in which the game is played.
Postings with subject "Re: NetGameMove" are "moves" in the game. A move
consists of:

1)  A reference to a previous posting ("In article .. &lt;x@y&gt; writes:"),
    without actually quoting anything, it's not a cascade.
    The reference may be NULL, i.e. none.
    You may not (directly) refer to a posting of yourself.

2)  A piece of text. This text is constructed from the text contained in
    the reference posting by appending a punctuation mark (optional) and
    a word (mandatory). If the reference is NULL, the text consists of a
    single word. 


The goal of the game is to see how the population (tree) of texts
evolves; uninteresting/nonsensical fragments will presumably die out out
of a lack of response, players may tend to divide into groups responding
to certain kinds of text-fragments etc. Maybe ultimately only a few
texts will survive that will somehow represent the thought of all
contributers in a mindmelt a la Spock ;-)

This will generate a large number of nearly identical messages; is that
really such a disaster? You could do something like abbreviating
frequently used largish fragments to keep the traffic roughly constant.


Kees
