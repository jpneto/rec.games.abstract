Too bad the game isn't on a torus topology!
Then there'd be only two distinct first moves!

Well, that's good news!  I recall being confused by one of
your games that had a flaw certain to come out the very
first time you played the game!

In Leroy's defense, the prestigious game manufacturer
Hasbro isn't much better.  They have a new game (Connect 4 Popout,
is it in stores yet?) with no less than <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>three<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> inadequacies
in the rules.  I informed them; AFAIK they amended only one
rule, and with a comment like "in the very rare case that ..."
Uh, Hasbro: It wasn't that rare; in fact it happens about
every other game!

A bit like Dots and Boxes perhaps, where there are clearly distinct
levels of expertise.

I may write a brute-force solver if I have trouble sleeping
tonight.  I'll run it first on 3x3 grid since that definitely
can be solved quickly.
