Why was the board shaped like that, rather than a straight hexagonal
lattice?

And don't forget the variant invented by Dan Hoey &amp; myself, "Projective Y":-
played on the same board, but with diametrically opposite edge points

Hey, that's cute.  A nice variant.  (Also note that it's a variant of Hex,
in which the starting sides are not determined.)  What board do you recommend
playing on?

Since we're on the topic of vaguely Hex-like games, I thought I'd mention
the higher-dimensional variants.  In particular, both Hex and Y have
natural generalizations to 4 (and any even) dimension, in which both
players are trying to construct surfaces.  You may enjoy working it out.
It may help to think about the three-dimensional asymmetric variants,
in which one player tries to connect top and bottom of a cylinder (or
connect all 4 sides of a tetrahedron, for Y).  What does the other player
need to do to stop her?  (Don't worry too much about the playing board,
although there are some nice choices for that as well.)

And I might as well mention the three-player three-dimensional game, in
which each player makes a surface spanning 4 of the 6 sides of a cube,
and two pieces fit at each location.
