Not at all :-) I play many abstract strategy games, some of which are
little known, but almost all my games are on the net. I have physical
boards for a few (Hex, and even more obscure: Plateau) but I almost
never find people to play with face to face. Although I'm in a
boardgaming group, there is very little interest in abstract strategy
two-players. People know that these kinds of games require a lot of
investment to enjoy (especially if it requires beating me, the local
abstract games geek <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>cough<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>), and they quite reasonably aren't willing
to do that if they know I am the only person they could ever play the
game with. Chess is then a better option - they are far more likely to
find other players, including ones at the right levels.

Net play (or to a lesser degree, computer play) partially fixes this
problem. Of the successful abstracts of the later years, some owe it a
lot to net play (Hive, Gipf series), and some other games have, if not
dazzling success as over-the-board games, at least thriving online
communities around them - Arimaa, Amazons, Cameron Browne's games,
Mark Steere's games, and lots of the more obscure games at Boardspace¸
gamerz.net/pbmserv, iggamecenter.com, and superdupergames.org.
