Ok my secret's out. I got less than I expected for xmas, I was momentarily pissed off, and I vented about it in a private chat with you and Luis.  What I don't understand is what you're so fucked up about that you felt the need to stab me in the back by publicly broadcasting it.  I spend a week defending you and your game and this is what I get.  If I knew you were going to be that fucked up about it I wouldn't have mentioned it.  Holy shit what a baby.
