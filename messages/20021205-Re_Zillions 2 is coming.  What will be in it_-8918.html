Off the top of my head, I'd like to see square attributes similar to piece
attributes, so that squares can have specific properties that affect the
properties of pieces sitting on them.  There might be workarounds to do
something like this already, but it would be awkward at best.

I'm sure I'll think of others!

You can do this now with zones.  This is how promotion works in games.
Pieces having multiple attributes separate from different pieces
types, would be useful though.

Yes, I know.  I've done quite a lot of scripting.  You should see my large
chess variant called Optima, availabe from me via email on request.  Very
complex.  Too complex for the taste of many, in fact.  Oh well.

What I have in mind is attributes that can be changed from true to false during
a move generation the way piece attributes can be.  I don't think there's any
way to dynamically change the zones in a game once they are defined, though I
could be wrong.

Piece and square attributes that take on integer values instead of simple
toggling from  true/false would be nice, too.  That way, you could have a game
in which a piece's "strength" changed during the game and you could compare one
piece's strength to another in order to make decisions.  I know that you could
do this by turning off one attribute and turning on another, but that seems
awkward and a lot of extra coding to write, and would also limit the number of
values to the number of possible attributes.
