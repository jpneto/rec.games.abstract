The game I'm referring to did not occur in the final match that

I may be wrong but I believe computer printouts later verified the
correctness of the assertion.  Also, it was not just Kasparov's
assertion; others said the same thing.  I'm not aware of any
knowledgeable persons who made a contradictory claim about the
position in question.

I rather doubt it.

Your statement, "Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make

I'm not aware of even a single instance where a computer program
sacrificed a piece when it was not able to search the subsequent
position to a depth where it would regain the piece.  If you know
of any examples, I would welcome seeing them.  Otherwise, I stand
by my statement.

First, your quoted statement doesn't say a sacrifice of a piece (not
just a pawn, or some exchange of theoretically negative material
value).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I did say piece or at least implied it.  You neglected to quote the
preceding sentence.  The full quote is

"In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov by
sacrificing a piece.  Computer programs are not supposed to be
able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons."


I looked up the game and actually it was a pawn sacrifice but
it appeared to be a type of sacrifice that had never occurred
in any published computer game.  The fact that such a strategic
looking sacrifice had never occurred before completely justifies
the statement "Computer programs are not supposed to be able
to make sacrifices for strategic reasons." (note that I said
"not supposed to be able to" instead of "can't" which has a
very different meaning in this context.  See below.)  As I
previously mentioned, it wasn't really a sacrifice for strategic
reasons but rather a sacrifice for tactical reasons.

Secondly, the fact that something doesn't generally happen
(because in the situations where it might occur, the computer that's
strong enough to make the move is also strong enough to search the
resulting variations) doesn't mean that it's "not supposed to be
possible".  It just means that it doesn't often happen with existing
programs in usual play.  That's a long way from impossibility.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I never said "can't" nor "impossible."  If there is not so much
as a single instance of a computer program doing X, then that
more than justifies the statement "Computers aren't supposed to
be able to do X."

I suspect you are misinterpreting my statement because you are
saying something similar.  Let me try to clarify myself.  Suppose
you are playing a game (chess, go, whatever) against a computer
and further suppose you are not aware of any instances of a
computer program using strategy X.  Now suppose that much to your
surprise, the computer program uses strategy X.  Your reaction
might be

"Whoa!  I didn't know a computer program could do THAT!"

or equivalently,

"What?!  Computer programs aren't supposed to be able to do THAT!"

Such a statement in no way implies "can't" or "impossible."
Quite the opposite.  You would conclude that the surprising instance
of a computer program using strategy X proves that it is possible,
if it weren't for the fact that I specifically pointed out that
the computer program didn't really use strategy X (sacrifice material
for strategic gains) but instead used strategy Y (sacrifice material
for tactical reasons) to choose a move that superificially appeared
to arise from strategy X.


Does this make it clearer?
