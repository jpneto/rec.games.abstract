   &gt;  * How are rules ordered?  The standard ruleset uses rule numbers to

   Why not just number proposals in the order that they appear on the
   mailing list?

Chuck I-forget-his-last-name objected, stating that you might be
playing via, say, direct email or netnews, in which case the message
delivery order will be different depending on where you are.  Even
using a mailing list, keeping track of the "order" would be difficult.

Actually, I was tempted to use the Date: on the message.  That's a bit
of a problem computationally, though, because then everyone has to be
able to figure out what "before" means when you're dealing with
different and sundry timezones.

   A bigger issue would be where to send the votes.  They could be sent
   to the proposer, but it is convenient to send all the votes to one
   place.

"Convenient"?  Bah, how difficult is it to send the reply to the
author?  I was thinking we might try to head that way on Tabula, even.

The other alternative would be to make voting public.

   The Custodian of the Bar of Tabula (my title is longer than yours!)

Yeah, but my salary is more than yours.  Nyah nyah.
