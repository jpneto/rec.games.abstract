Maybe �level� is the better word. My english is not so good...

For example, a
player with a 1000 rating (a low, but legitimate rating) will lose about
75% of the time to a player rated 1200, who will lose about 75% of the
time to a 1400 rated player... etc., all the way up to 2800, a mark only
a few elite Grandmasters have ever achieved.

Is 1000 a chess-rating for an absolut chess-beginner, which just has learnt
the rules?

I've also read much on the estimate on the number of levels GO has, but
alas, I know very little about GO and can't give my own opinion on that
one.  40 seems awful high, however.  My gut feeling is the number may
actually be closer to half that.  If not, that's great!  40 levels...
wow!

In the usual kyu-dan rating system an absoult beginner is usual ranked as 30
kyu. The best players in the world are something about 10 dan. And one rank
difference is very close to 75% winning chance.
