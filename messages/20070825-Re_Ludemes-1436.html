<br><blockquote type=cite>Je conserve l'impression d'avoir inventé le terme et le concept de ludème à
<br>l'occasion de la mise en ordre de mes livres sur les jeux de cartes et les
<br>jeux de table mais je ne parviens pas à retrouver un texte dans lequel je
<br>l'aurais mentionné. Donc pour l'instant Alain Borvo est le seul auteur
<br>connu à l'avoir écrit mais son texte me semble bien tardif.
<br>Il faudrait voir sur quoi Parlett se fondait.
<br>A suivre.
<br>
<br></blockquote>It was indeed in the late Alain Borvo's book on Aluette that I first 
encountered the term ludeme and its attribution, since denied, to Pierre 
Berloquin. At the time I didn't think much of it, and on the first 
occasion that I mentioned it in print (in my Oxford Guide to (aka 
History of) Card Games) I did so only in passing and with a regrettably 
rude dismissal of it as "eminently dispensable". At the time, in fact, I 
thought it rather pretentious. By some stroke of irony, I later found 
reference to the word somewhere on the internet with a mistaken 
attribution to me, presumably from a reader of the Oxford book. Since 
then, however, I have found myself using it unconsciously, even almost 
against my will.
<br>
<br>If, then, Monsieur Berloquin now asks on what authority I base my use of 
the word, the answer is simply the purely pragmatic one of usefulness. 
It is so useful that it doesn't even need to be defined. The area in 
which it strikes me as most useful is that of evidently related features 
common to games of differing and otherwise unrelated types. For example, 
the game of Losing Chess on one hand, and card games of the Hearts 
family on the other, exemplify the concept of reversing the object of 
play from positive to negative. The reversal concept is a typical 
ludeme, in that it can be applied to many other games of other types. In 
the realm of card games specifically, another ludeme is that of the Jack 
as some kind of a trickster figure, ranging from the eponymous card in 
the ancient game of Karnöffel, to the card that scores 2 for his heels 
or 1 for his nob at Cribbage, to the most significant card at All Fours 
(Pitch, etc), and eventually to its complete conversion into the Joker 
of Euchre and Poker and subsequent wild card of Rummy.
<br>
<br>If a definition of the term is required, I can do more than to 
characterise it as a type of meme specific to the field of games. As for 
the definition of meme, see Richard Dawkins, who invented it, or the 
relevant Wikipedia article. In brief, I do not claim to invented the 
word ludeme; I not only credited it to its presumed inventor when I 
first used it but have since made enquiries as to its origin through 
other contacts in France (albeit without success); and I make no claim 
to its universal indispensability. I use it because I find it useful, 
and its meaning has always seemed plain enough to me from its context. 
What more can one ask of a word?
