2) When playing "Y" against the Zillions engine, the swap rule, as I
understand it, is not being implemented correctly.

In Hex and other connection games (Twixt) where the swap rule is often
used, normally after Black makes an opening play, White then chooses
whether to take this move as his own (swapping) or simply let it be
and move elsewhere.  However, in this Zillions implementation, Black
moves, then White moves, and THEN White decides to swap colors.  (If
White does swap, in effect this gives Black the poorest first move
possible, but of course it's Black's turn again.)

That really doesn't sound right.  That would mean that the same Player B
(starting as White) would make a White move, elect to swap, and then
immediately make a Black move, all while Player A does nothing.

I think this is a bug in implementing a "3-move swap", which should go:
A: black move; B: white move; A: black move; B: swap; A: white move.  Or
it could be a "2-move swap" (less likely, in my opinion), which should
go: A: black move; B: white move; A: swap; B: black move.  In either
case, the player who chooses to swap is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the player who gets the
"extra" move immediately afterward.

For comparison, Richard's PBEM Server implements the game with a
straight hexagonal grid (as you suggest, this is much easier for a
general-purpose game engine to work with), and uses a 1-move swap rule.
