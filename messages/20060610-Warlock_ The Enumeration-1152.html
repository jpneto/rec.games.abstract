We (Occult Entertainment) are developing a new card game - Warlock: The
Enumeration. And we need your help.

This game isn't really "new" - it has been in constant development for
over 5 years now.
We have had hundreds of playtesters and developers during this time,
which has helped us pound out a solid,
easy to understand rules system.

We have wiped the slate clean, kept the mechanics (rules), and are
starting over from the ground up.

All we really need to do is make the cards that follow in with the the
rules system
and organize everything for public release.

Now before we go any further: the game, like everything else Occult
Entertainment publishes, is FREE.
That means the user will not have to pay to download the game (cards
and books will be in PDF format)
and developers will not get paid to create it. Jobs pay our bills.
Occult Entertainment is our hobby.

Still interested?

Simply put, we are looking for people that will help us create this
game.
Our schedule for the development of Warlock follows:

Design (Begin creating the set)
Design will take about 4 weeks
STARTS: JUNE 10, 2006
ENDS: JULY 10, 2006

Development (Analyze, playtest, and edit)
