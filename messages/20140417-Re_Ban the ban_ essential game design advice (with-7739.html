Excellent. Both chess and go fail. However, a lot of the modern
rectilinear-grid connection games fail even harder, such as ones
that specify no diagonal-only adjacency (e.g. slither), which is
a shame.

Where would you say Blokus' placement rules sit - there do say that
you move by placing a piece, and then forbid where you can place it,
so I think it's also a fail. However, you could theoretically reword
the rules such that there is no ban, without actually changing the
game at all. (However, concave shapes can be described as the union
of convex shapes, so this is saying little.)


I thought the comment from lewpuls was ironic, given that the 
site he linked to contains this:
