	I think there is some confusion here... the games "sprouts" and
"drago" have been described by M. Gardner in one of his monthly
collaborations with Scientific American, and also published as books
(sorry, I do not remember the references and I have not handy neither
the book nor the magazines).

	The game described by <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mpf@theory.lcs.mit.edu">mpf@theory.lcs.mit.edu</a> (Michael P. Frank) is
"drago" (for those curious about this name, "drago" is the name of a
tree from the Canary Islands). "sprouts" is similar, with the only
difference that dots are replaced by crosses. Every arm of the cross
can eventually become the start of an edge. When an edge is drawn from
one cross to another cross, a small segment is to be added crossing
the segment: thus, when connecting the first cross with the second
cross, an intermediate cross is generated:

	
	+-----------------+--------------------+

    ^				  ^					   ^
First cross     Intermediate        Second Cross



	Further edges must be added departing from the existent crosses.
	Well, this game is much simpler than "drago", and winning
strategies are known. Check M. Gardner's articles.
