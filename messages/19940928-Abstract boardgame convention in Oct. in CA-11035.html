It just occurred to me that the people of this newsgroup might be
interested:

NOST, the Knights of the Square Table, is having its annual
convention at the Ramada Inn in Palm Springs CA (1800 East Palm
Canyon Drive at Sunrise Way), 5-10 October, with the official
events on the weekend (8-9 October).

NOST is an organization for postal game-playing.  Chess is the
predominant game, but we play a wide variety of other games: 
XiangQi, Shogi and its variants, Marseillais (two-move) Chess,
Avalanche Chess, Ultima, checkers, Lines of Action, Amazons,
Salvo (20x20 Battleships), Secret Word (Jotto), go (from 9-line
to 27-line), Othello, Delta, Fanorona, and on and on.  Postally or, more
recently, by e-mail.  No wargames or multiplayer games.  Likewise at
conventions, though more commercial games have showed up at the last
couple.

Non-NOST can't participate in the chess events (speed chess, the
team chess, or the simul with the master), but you're welcome to
the chess variant tournament Saturday afternoon, the introduction
to Go Saturday evening, or the informal play in the evenings.  Or
you could sign up at the con....
