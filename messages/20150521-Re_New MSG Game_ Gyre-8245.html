I have another fear.
The game is maybe easy to solve.
I mean the winning strategy is somewhat tricky.
Either you "surround" your opponent either he surrounds you.
The best way to win is to play "sparse". As you are the first player 
you will have hudge advantage.

Hi Hazen,

Thanks for the feedback.  Interesting analysis.  If Player 1 is allowed to claim the center cell, i.e. no pie rule, I think he could win by mirroring all of Player 2's moves after that.  I'm sure there would be a huge first turn advantage without the pie rule.  What the pie rule attempts to do is to convert a huge first move advantage into a small second turn advantage.  The tradeoff is that Player 1 has to make a crappy enough first move that it it doesn't matter if Player 2 invokes the pie rule or not.  If Player 2 doesn't invoke the pie rule, Player 1 continues to lead by a half turn, but has made a half crappy first move to compensate for this advantage.

The pie rule works in Hex, and I believe it would work in Gyre, but that's only my guess.

To understand what I want to say you simulate the game by 
playing randomly.
My first thoughts for now.
Not deep but some sort of sketch.
I think that with little AI no human player can beat a computer.
Good luck to you anyway.

I filled the board randomly with stones three times, just to test the geometric principle and to see what I could discover.  Of course it works, and the winning paths were kind of tortuous, not as direct as in the rule sheet diagrams.

Ok, well the board is there if anyone wants to play Gyre.

If you want to have a confirmation of the existence of winning strategy post your game Gyre here :

- Forum projecteuler
or forum xkcd puzzles
or AoPS forum "combinatorics"

you will surely find some graph theorist interested. I think that the problem is not hard to solve.

I wish you good luck.

I'll check in with them in a couple weeks.  Starting a new hobby.  Remote control helicopters.

I'll make the first move.  Let's play out a couple of moves just to see what happens.
