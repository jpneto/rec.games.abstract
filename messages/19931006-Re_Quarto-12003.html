Yes, this is the way we played it.  That's also the reason I lost with
three pieces to go.  I didn't pay very close attention to what I
picked out of the three remaining pieces and just handed my opponent
one of them.  I had already figured the game was pretty much a draw,
despite all the raving the seller was doing about how the game rarely
ended in a draw.  Turns out he was right; I stopped paying close enough
attention at the end to give him to win.  Big whoop.

Didn't try this.


Despite all of my lukewarm comments, I figure that this might be a fun
game to actually make a set for yourself.  It's not as if the pieces are
that complicated.  And the game would be good for a short diversion now
and again.
