It seems to me that the first player has an easy win by simply playing all

Ok, let's discuss this for the 7x7 board. Assume that black only plays
on the left and right edge.

Note: For this article, the egdes don't include the four corners of the
board. So the left and right edge consist of 10 points in total.

The trouble is that White needs at least 7 moves to win on an edge
(namely, three moves to close the channel above, three moves to close
it below and one move to close one edge), while black needs only
5 moves to completely block that edge.

Here is a winning strategy for black:
a) on the first move, play on the left edge
b) in reply to white's move, if possible:
   - if white moves on the center column, play on the right edge
     (i.e. the edge opposite to the first move)
   - if white plays on the center row, play on the opposite edge
     (this is the key trick)
   - otherwise, play on the edge on the same side of the board white
     just played on.
c) if this is not possible, play on the other edge
d) otherwise, play any valid move.

Note that once both edges are completely filled, white can no longer
win, and, because draws are impossible, black will win eventually.

If black follows that strategy, white can not win. There are two
scenarios to consider:

1) white forms a channel on one edge without using black's stones on the
   other edge. To do that, white must play at least two stones in the
   center column (meaning that including the first move black has played
   at least one stone on the edge the channel is on), one stone in the
   center row, on the side opposite of the channel, and four more stones
   on the side the channel is on. By the strategy above, black has
   already played at least 1+1+4-1 = 5 stones on the edge the channel is
   on at the time white would play the last of these stones, blocking it
   completely.

2) white forms a channel by blocking it above, using some of black's
   stones on one edge and blocking it below. So he has to play at
   least 5 stones below and 5 above the channel, but before that happens,
   black has already completed 10 moves and filled both edges completely,
   preventing a win for white.

So white can not win either way.

The argument carries over to larger boards.

Bertram
