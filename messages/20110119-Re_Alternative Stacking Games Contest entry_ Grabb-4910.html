Maybe you should have a better look when you're less distracted ;-)

I'm prescribing a giant bong hit for you, Christian, to be taken
before reading or responding to any more of my posts  ;D

First, I completely understand the rules of Grabber. It's a
combinatorial game. Not real complicated. Second, my critique was not
a suggestion to add forced captures. 

I'm going to critique all the games both before play testing them and
after. There will be philosophical observations such as "I don't like
the turn signaling requirement." This doesn't mean your game sucks
because it has that.

I'm in a dentist office typing on my cellphone so apologies for
grammar, etc. Anyway, "Your game has an aesthetic Hiroshima" is hard
to interpret as a compliment so I tried, unsuccessfully apparently, to
soften the blow by noting the grab mechanism is an interesting one,
which comment was unfortunately misinterpreted. [shaking head] :D

The "grab" is fairly elementary. There aren't a lot of simple,
ergonomic, one handed stack manipulations left. MQ. Leaving the bottom
checker behind.
