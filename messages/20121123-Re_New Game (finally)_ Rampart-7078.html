Wow. that was epic. This one ended with basically two big groups, and one was wiped out. How often do you think it will end that way at high levels of play?

Well that's not uncommon for Rampart. In fact I suspect that would be the norm in Hex Rampart because its very easy to create life and it isn't as essential create thorny structures like it is in square Rampart. The opponent basically needs stones on both sides of a wall in order to attack in the hex version, so if you've cordoned off an area you're probably safe.
