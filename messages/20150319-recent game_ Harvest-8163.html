This one I didn't like as much as the other two - what I read of it. I only read 3 pages and then was expected to install an app to finish reading it. But the rules seemed a little busy.  I like the fact that it has only one color though. As far removing split-off groups, there's another game based on the that.  If I think about it I might remember.
