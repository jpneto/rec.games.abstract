If you like 3 games and think all of the other ones suck
equally then you're giving points pretty arbitrarily to the
other games.  From a voters perspective it might make
more sense to order the games that you like and then just
not list the other games.

Now you've got the same problem you were trying to solve by switching to the
list system.  One judge can corrupt the contest by voting 10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.

How about this?  Each judge must pick his top three games, in order, which
games are then awarded 3, 2, and 1 points, respectively.

Btw, if there is a tie, so what?  It's not like there's an indivisible prize
riding on this.  Ties are abhorrent in games of course, but not necessarily
in game contests.
