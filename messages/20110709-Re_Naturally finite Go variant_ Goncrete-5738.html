One game you guys might want to check out is Conversion Go (http://
home.fuse.net/swmeyers/conversion.htm), which I invented some years
ago.  It combines the Go principle of occupying liberties with the
Anchor principle of connecting to certain sides in order to guarantee
life.  I don't consider it to be an improvement on Go, but I think it
is a solid variant.

I think the time is ripe to dedicate a section of mindsports(.nl) to
othellonian capture in Go variants because the subject appears
somewhat underexposed.
There are now as far as I know three mechanisms present to 'ensure
life' where it is so hard to come by: the Rosette of Medusa and Lotus
(introduced in the seventies by Mark Berger in his Go variant of the
same name, played on the triple contacts of a hexhexboard, regular
capture), the 'Eye opener' of Goncrete and the Anchor principle of
Steven's Conversion Go.

And Sygo of course, that escapes the need for any specific mechanism
to that end, because a player can combine several moves in one turn to
create eye-shape, reducing the problem to proportions that fit the
general strategy and tactics.
