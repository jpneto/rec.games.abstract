The fraction of legal chess positions that would ever need to be reached

Now that's the interesting assertion. Obviously I can see why not all
positions would have to be considered. I can't see a convincing argument
why this reduction is significant, let alone many orders of magnitude.

There's a published paper on this (not available online, to my
knowledge).  "Information Content of Chess Positions", by Jurg
Nievergelt.

To convince yourself that the "reasonable positions" are a very tiny
subset of the set of all legal arrangements, just place the 32 chess
pieces at random on the chessboard (with perhaps a few out of play), and
then ask yourself, "Does this position look remotely sensible in actual
play?"  The answer will be no.  Repeat over and over until you get
bored.  You'll give up long before you can generate a reasonable
position at random.

This is based on the assumption that we use backwards analysis from
the end of the game. Using forwards analysis from the start of the
game we have to consider something closer to the number of all
possible games, not just all possible positions,

No, you would use some form of memoization or caching to avoid computing
the value of the same position over and over.  All modern chess programs
already do something like this.
