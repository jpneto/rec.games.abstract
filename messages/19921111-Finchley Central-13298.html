Hello all. This is a rather abstract game, which I blatantly remember
from a copy of a magazine called Imagine (I think!) many years ago. The
game is called Finchley Central....

Rules:

1) Each player takes turns in naming a London Underground Tube Station.

2) The first player to name Finchley Central wins.


That's it.
Yep that's all there is to it.

This one always confuses people who perhaps do not think in such an
obscure way that I do. Starting players will soon build up a formidable
lead in the points stake, leading, as always with Finchley Central.

Perhaps by the fourth game, and plenty of comments such as 'This is
****ing stupid!', the confused player will start with something like
'Waterloo', and from then on, the game reaches a whole new plane of
thought.

It is not the winning that counts in this game (which after all, is not
difficult!), but it is the STYLE you play it in - for instance winning
after a complete circuit of the Circle Line, or perhaps a grand slam of
the mainline stations is just SO satisfying.....

Thoughts please....
Ralph.
