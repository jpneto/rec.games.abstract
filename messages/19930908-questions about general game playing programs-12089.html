  Hey:

  About a year ago (and a couple computer accounts ago) I posted an
  article in which I asked if people had written their own general game 
  playing programs, and if so, did they want to share. The only response I
  got was from (if memory serves) Barney Pell, who had put together
  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exactly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the thing I wanted, except... it wouldn't run on my
  machine (I think it was some version of Prolog that I don't have access
  to).

  I have a c program that does this, 'cept it's so poorly written I wouldn't
  show it to my mom, much less anyone else. But I'm currently in the process
  of re-writing it. My goal is to make it general enough that anyone wanting
  to write a program to check out a new game would only have to write the
  following routines:
    
     - a move generator; given a board position, generate a legal move list.
     - a move processor; given a board position and a move, perform the move
	 on the board
     - a scoring function
     - a 'did I win' (or 'did I lose') function that tells you if the current
	 position is a win/loss (i.e. is the game over yet)
     - a board initializer

  Given these 5 routines, my code will do the 'ol alpha-beta thing, handle
  the user interface, handle play in several different modes (computer vs
  human, computer vs computer using different scoring functions, etc), and
  be fairly flexible in terms of search depth, move sorting, etc.

  Basically, almost any game that involved 2 players using discrete pieces 
  on a rectangular lattice could be played with this code. The goal is to 
  allow you to spend more time playing with the scoring function (the
  interesting part of all this) and less time with the mechanics of writing
  a game player. Using my current (poorly written) one, I've been able to
  make a decent program for a new game in under 2 hours - pretty cool.

  So, a couple questions:

    1) Has this been done already (my guess: certainly) - should I stop
       working on mine and FTP from somewhere?
    2) If there is no easily available code for general game playing, would
       people be interested in mine, once I'm finished rewriting it?

  Thanks.
