It's too hard to strategize.  There's nothing you can really plan for
until the last 4 moves of the game.  There's a little window of like 2
moves where, by the time you realize what's going on, it's too late.
It's now a Nim-equivalent end game.

Although at first it seems like it should be that way, it's not.  I've
played the OddGroup pattern ~100 times, and lost only once.  I have a
sense of where the game will go by the fourth move of the game.  I
assure that the window is much larger than you say, provided you
design the game correctly.

You're as brilliant as anybody here.

Thank you, Mark

How do you enforce that?  What if the last move of the game causes an
even number of groups to form?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Then the blocker wins.  It never gets to that point though, since it
becomes obvious who the winner will be when the board is about 2/3
full, at least using the minimum group size that I typically use.  I
know you don't really playing games, but on the off chance that you
want to see how it works, I'd be happy to play a round with you at
iggc.

Nick, move on from Mind Ninja.  It's well known and well thought of.
Yes, you could take it farther indefinitely, but it's time to do
something else.

This post isn't really supposed to be about Mind Ninja, but rather
parity.  But if it were about Mind Ninja, well, I like what I like, as
do you.  I am also as stubborn in my preferences as you are in yours,
so (respectfully) it would be more productive for you to ignore the
posts that bore you rather than try to convince me to be equally
bored.
