 I'm going to Brussel Sprout this game :-).  Consider the game where
you don't have edges (i.e. infinitely long track).  The players
keep playing until both are out of chips.  If the token is in it's
original position, the game is a draw.  Otherwise the player whose
side it is on wins.

   There's an easy never-lose solution to this version.  Just bet the minimum
bet every time until your opponent in out of money; then bet the minimum (or
$1 if the minimum bet is zero) and move the piece one slot every time.  You
can't lose; if your opponent ever bets more than 1 over the minimum then
you will win.
   Then again, maybe trivialize is what you meant by "Brussel Sprout" the
game.  As was pointed out to me a while back, Brussel Sprouts is a game that
at first seems like a nifty variant of Sprouts but is really rather pointless.
