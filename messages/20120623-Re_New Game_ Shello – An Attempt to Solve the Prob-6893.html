Mark at iGGC:
"Not to lick my own sack, ala CF, but Redstone was pretty remarkable considering that I have virtually no understanding of Go, and that it was purely cerebral, conceived, while driving at night. No testing whatsoever.

Sounds familiar. Not true, because a week later the argument was still going on and you already had admitted to 'missing' a point or two. But familiar..

In fact, you only got the idea to use neutral stones 'cerebral'. Big deal. There's Reversi with neutral stones, a well-known mancala with neutral stones, Draughts with neutral men, it's not all that remarkable to have the idea. Congrats anyway. 
In case you 'missed' that too: you're hijacking Nick's thread. 

Nice idea by the way, Nick, but leaning a bit on Slither. Good thing it's not a connection game though, that alley is running a bit stale. By the way, the generally ignored Charybdis attempts the same: making Othello more fun.. But you know how it is: "old games are always better", ask Ralf Gering ;-)
