It <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ugly to say that (your words), "peple are getting quite stupid

To paraphrase what I said before..... settle down.

Oh, and "people" is is not spelled "peple." It's always good policy to
proofread your responses when you are suggesting that people are
stupid and illiterate.

Well, you have to cut him some slack. Remember that he's a strange
visitor from another planet where well-off people never 'prostitute'
themselves by recommending things they don't use themselves. And where
allowing oneself to be photographed playing in a simultaneous for a
prize constitutes such 'prostitution'.

And there's also the fact that he can't even read. After all, if he
could, being so interested in Teeko, he would surely have gone to the
URL I gave in an earlier post
(
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=style/postmagazine&amp;contentId=A43740-2001Jul10">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=style/postmagazine&amp;contentId=A43740-2001Jul10</a>
)
and read this:
&lt;&lt;He redoubled his marketing efforts in 1955, with the publication of
Scarne on Teeko and with a tournament at the 21 Club in New York. The
tournament was a promotional event; Scarne challenged 10 people --
Braddock; actors Judy Holliday and Walter Slezak; national champions of
chess and bridge -- to play Teeko against him simultaneously. Scarne
offered a $1,000 prize to anyone who could win two out of three games.
He invited a Life photographer and gave the magazine an exclusive: "The
five-page article that will appear in Life Magazine following the
tournament should sell one million Teeko games," he told friends.
The evening at 21 was a success in that Scarne won all 10 matches, but
otherwise it was a losing effort. He had ordered up canapes shaped like
Teeko pieces, and let his guests run up a $5,000 tab. However, no story
ever appeared, in Life or anywhere else.&gt;&gt;

Not to mention
&lt;&lt;It's unclear whether Scarne actually sold the hundred thousand or half
million Teeko sets he claimed.&gt;&gt;

Then too, when I wrote
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It's possible that as a result of Scarne's years-long publicity
blitz he managed to sell 100,000 copies of the game, though I
wouldn't bet on it; how many of those games actually got played
is another question.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
a person who could read would realize that I was questioning both the
accuracy and the relevance of the '100,000' figure and that answering

was simply missing the point. (And the maker of Pente claims a million
sales before selling it to Parker Brothers, though I'd view that figure
with suspicion too.)

Then again, maybe I'm wrong and he's just an arrogant (however
knowledgeable) jerk, rudely intolerant of any views differing from his
own. I dunno.
