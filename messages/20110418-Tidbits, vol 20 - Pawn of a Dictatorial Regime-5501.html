A quote from the personal monologue of Ralf Gering (a.k.a. Mr_Mancala,
truthforum2001, Afrika, Five_Stars, etc.):

"I am glad that my ill health helped me to resist the temptation of going to
Kazakhstan, where I would have been instrumentalized into becoming a pawn of
a dictatorial regime."

Isn't that kind of a litmus test?  When you're being covertly manipulated by
a foreign government?

The suggestion is that Kazahkstan's refusal to accommodate Ralf Gering's
impertinent demand to fast track his visa application caused Ralf to
contract a mysterious "illness", or some such nonsense.

Ralf Gering goes on to explain:

"The genuine friendliness of many Kazakh players made some people
'metaphorically' blind in regard to the propagandist aspects of this sports
event and the true nature of the Kazakh government."

Toguz Kumulak is not the innocent game it appears to be.  It's a subversive
plot.

Why would anyone join the ridiculous Ralf Gering monologue forum?  Daniel,
you were mysteriously drawn to Ralf.

=================================================

The first official Toguz Kumalak World Championship will be held November
1-7 in
Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. A cool video was posted on
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.9kumalak.kz/">http://www.9kumalak.kz/</a> .

The site says in Kazakh that players from 17 nations will participate:

Antigua and Barbuda, Azerbaidzhan, China, Czech Republic, Egypt, Georgia,
Germany, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyztan, Mongolia, Russia, Spain, Switzerland,
Ukraine,
Uzbekistan, Turkey, Turkimenistan.

The participants from at least 5 nations (probably 7 or more) were invited
by
the Ministry of Tourism and Sport, which pays all expenses except visa. At
least
one participant never had played Toguz Kumalak before. Two participants from
Germany refused the invitation, one because of her family, the other one
because
of health reasons. Most guests had to try to obtain their visa by
themselves,
which proved to be difficult in Spain and Germany. I was told that some
particpants were expected to drive more than 1,200 kilometres to get their
visa.
The Kazakh Foreign Ministry handicapped visa application in numerous
European
countries in recent weeks (United Kingdom: September 28, Portugal, Spain &amp;
France: October 1, Germany and Danmark: October 11) forcing European citizen
to
drive millions of kilometres (estimation) to apply for visa. While the
Kazakh
Embassy in Germany claims "technical reasons", some have speculated that it
might be a "retaliation" against unfair treatment of Kazakh citizens, when
they
apply for visa, or that it could be related to the upcoming OSCE Conference
in
Astana probably to prevent human rights activists to travel to Kazakhstan.

I was actually invited, but cannot go due to health reasons (somebody
speculated
it was caused by the stress I had trying to get the visa, but I doubt it).

Ralf
