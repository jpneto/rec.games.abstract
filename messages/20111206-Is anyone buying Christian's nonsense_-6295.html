I'm totally serious.  This shit has been going on for 13 months, most
recently in the Arimaa forum.

"As far as the quest for a game that is finite, drawless and perfectly
balanced, Symple complies,"

"[Symple's] balancing system is the most sophisticated in the realm of
abstract games yet,"

Is anyone else nauseated by this?  Why is anyone intimidated by Christian
Freeling?  I have a theory.  Christian hails from the era of him and Bill
Taylor.  Bill Taylor is a turd, so only Christian's legacy matters, from
that era.

Every time I mention Bill Taylor, I get an email from a university wanting
to interview me.  It's Bill's way of saying that he has a teaching
certificate and I don't.  I freely admit that, Bill.  But your field of
expertise is clearly not abstract game design.  You know <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fuck all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> about
abstract games.  That's why you're a gas giant.  That's why you're no longer
allowed here.

What does all this prove?  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Everyone<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> reads this shit, even Bill Taylor,
persona non grata.  If I stopped posting here, there'd be a hole in peoples'
lives.  Don't worry.  I won't quit.  But due to constant saxophone practice,
I have to cut back my Internet activity, except for Christian Freeling.
