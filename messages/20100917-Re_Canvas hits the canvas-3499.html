You're welcome?  It's my fault you released a shitty game.

If you're disappointed with Canvas, imagine how the players would have
felt about it.  All's well that ends well, right?  What are you all
fucked up about?

Yeah sure, there's still the BGG entry but BGG is hardly a respectable site.

If you don't want it on bgg, tell them Canvas hit the canvas and ask

Well Mark, generally the admins don't take games off of BGG because
somebody doesn't like it, even if that person designed the game. That
site is bullshit though, you can't do so much as upload an image
without it going through the shameless bureaucracy. Anyway the players
were the ones pushing me into it in the first place. I was just going
to screw around with it in the sandbox. Mind you Canvas isn't a shitty
game. I mean you wouldn't know a good game if you saw one. It's
practically just a coincidence that somebody with the autistic design
principals you have could even make a half-decent game.  But I'll be
the first to admit Canvas is a lame design. I mean it's not just
Amazons and Hex but there's nothing very interesting about it either.
