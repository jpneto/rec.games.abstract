Let's compare chess to boxing for a minute.  As I see it, a checkmate
is like a KO in boxing.  I believe this is a decent analogy, because a
checkmate is similar to what happens in a KO in boxing.  In both
games, "combinations" are referred to also.  So, I will ask here: What
would boxing be like if a boxing match ended without a knockout, and
it meant there was a draw?   And what if the defending champion
happened to keep his title if he didn't get knocked out?

If boxing was like this, would there more more or less knockouts?  I
believe they have winning by decision for a reason.
