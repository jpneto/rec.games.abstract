Hi Carl,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
could you please explain a little further what is the aim
of this site is?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

To present and discuss the ideas before the real coding begins

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You sound like you are describing a server for abstract games, allowing
computer programs, and/or human players to connect to.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That server (connecting people and computers) is too ambitious, I don't have the
resources for it! :(

The ARENA will be made only by computer programs, that will evolve until their
ELO stabilize. Perhaps a intermediate stage will be needed, when some expert
players will enter the competition to force evolution. Then, the best player
(together with the ACADEMY knowledge) will be placed on an applet to be used by
real people.

I also hope that the set of tournaments will provide information about the game
measures that are presented on the webpage. Perhaps then, I can create a measure
to classify abstract games by their complexity vs clarity.

Of course, another point of announcing on the internet, is to seek for
interested people who want to spend some coding time with it! ;-)
