Let's say that you're playing on a grid that has a total of N boxes up
for grabs. The very first captured box is worth N points, the second
captured box is worth N-1 points, the third captured box is worth N-2,
etc.

The idea here is that players won't be able to play for just the last
move, so the game won't be completely about parity.

Perhaps another play-by-forum game after the old one is done? I wish
dots and boxes would be "fixed" so that it was possible to play on
larger boards without the first moves being meaningless... but somehow
I think this idea needs a little more work. It's good for a dream
(most dream games  are inconsistent and too weird to put into print
IME!)
