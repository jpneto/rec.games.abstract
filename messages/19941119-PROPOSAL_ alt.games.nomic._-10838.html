Nomic is an abstract social game, based on reflexivity and
self-modification in law. Several games of Nomic are currently being
played on the Internet, mainly through mailing lists. The largest is Agora
Nomic, with around 25 members. It's discussion lists easily generate 100+
messages per day.

Recently, there's been interest in starting a Usenet-based game of Nomic.
We're not planning on moving any of the current games to Usenet, but
starting from scratch with a new game.

Therefore, we propose the creation of an alt.games.nomic.* hierarchy. For
the time being, this will include only alt.games.nomic and
alt.games.nomic.&lt;name&gt;, where &lt;name&gt; is the name for the new game of Nomic
(we're still discussing that name). alt.games.nomic will be for general
discussion of Nomic in general, while alt.games.nomic.&lt;name&gt; will be for
the actual play of the game. One possible future extension to the
hierarchy is alt.games.nomic.internomic, for discussion of the Nomic
"meta-game," a concept currently being kicked around where each separate
game of Nomic being played would be a Player in a meta-game of Nomic, and
alt.games.nomic. This isn't yet generating enough traffic to warrant an
entire newsgroup, but it may someday.
