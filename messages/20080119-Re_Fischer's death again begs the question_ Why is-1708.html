I have asked this before on here I believe.  Well, the death of
Fischer begs the question once more.  I also posted this on Boardgame

Bobby Fischer's death is in the news, and causes people to remember
the 1970s, when chess was king, and people tuned into PBS to watch
chess. Chess was a culturally iconic back then. I remember reading Mad
Magazine when I was a kid, and they actually did a spoof with a chess
based superhero. Fischer made all the magazine covers, and it was
WWIII on the board. It wasn't just the Cold War either. When America
beat Russia in the Winter Olympics at hockey, and played them, there
wasn't an outbreak of hockey all over, like there was with Chess. I
remember when I was a kid in the 1970s, there was a chess store that
opened up near where I lived.

Note that this is only an American phenomenom... Chess has always been
far more popular in Europe.  I tend to believe that it WAS just the
political situation that made chess popular in the US during the 70's.
Americans like to win... even more, they like to beat their 'enemies'.
why has chess fallen in popularity? perhaps because America was only
briefly ontop during the Fischer era...  Once the Soviets dominated
the game, then they lost interest.  You use Hockey as an example, well
Hockey is not a huge game in the US,  but here in Canada we win alot
and the game is THE game in Canada.  Most of the NHL players in the US
were raised in Canada.  You say there wasn't an outbreak of hockey in
the US? hmmm look at howmany more NHL teams are in the US than Canada
now... compare that to the 70's... 

Chess on TV is pretty boring unless you are into it.  I know alot of
people who like to play chess but have never played in a club.   Alot
of these people watch games online or review them in a pgn viewer.
World wide, Chess is watched alot.  How many of us have been following
Corus?  I bet Ive watched more corus matches than hockey games on TV
(and im canadian!).  Its hard to judge just what the audience is for
chess, because unlike many other games, we can easily watch a game
going on on multiple websites.  I personally like to dl the pgn of the
games and run them through fritz... is this considered 'watching' the
game? all this and without irritating commercials :).  Chess is
probably unique in this aspect.

Please don't get me started about American Gladiator being back, or
the fact that guys fixing motorcycles has a TV show. I can close by
saying a program about people have dirty jobs actually is on TV now.
Come on! All this and no chess?

If chess was on TV, I don't know that I would watch the show.  I find
most TV is irritating anyways.  I prefer how it is now, you can watch
the game live on websites with GM's kibitzing (and many patzers too :)
Also for TV you need real 'characters'... chess players are generally
very introspective people who 'play the board'.  Unlike poker where
acting ability increases your chance of winning thus producing many
'characters'.

Just my 2cents worth :)
