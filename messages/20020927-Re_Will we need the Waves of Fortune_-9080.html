Hi people,

Talking with Bill Taylor, he noticed that if there was
no mistakes in some n-in-a-row game we were playing, the
game would be always the same, i.e., the perfect game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There could be many such perfect games, although they would all have the
same result.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That remark stayed inside my mind for a couple of days,
I think because it annoyed me the feeling that, in
perfect information games (i.e., no luck and no
hidden information), two players devoting enough time
and skill so that eventually are able to completely
master the game they love, will destroy it! The game
collapses to a single and fixed contest - always win,
always loose, always draw...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, that's why few people get much pleasure from playing tic-tac-toe, as
they know the result will always be a draw.  So it's a good job the
interesting games of perfect information (go, chess, etc.) are way beyond
the ability of the human mind to master in this way!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Now, in games where the random factor exists this does
not happen! I'm not talking of 100% random procedures
(they are not games) like the Roulette or the Lottery,
but something like Backgammon (a game with luck) or
Stratego (a game with hidden information). If the
balance of randomness is finely tuned, a good player
will consistently beat any worse player.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As is the case for interesting games of perfect information with no chance.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Facing two perfect players in a game like that, the
final outcome is not decided at all! Using a fair
random generator, each will have 50% of chance to
win, a perfect balance to give the exciting feeling
lost forever on a completely analysed game where those
"nasty" things, like Fortune, do not appear...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Maybe not 50% - that depends on the game.  Even for games like backgammon
there will be a perfect strategy to follow that maximises your winning
chances in any position.  Once both players have seen this they will simply
employ this strategy in every game they play.  The result - at the start of
the game both players will know black's expected winning chances are 53.7%
(or whatever).  As the game progresses this value may change, but both
players will always know the value, and the best thing for each player to do
given the results of the dice rolls.  So for these players, playing there
will not really be any "exciting feeling" - they might as well save
themselves some time and toss a suitably weighted coin instead!

I suppose there might be some excitement in watching such a game develop and
seeing how it turns out, but this would be no different really from the
excitement in "Beggar your neighbor" which actually involves no skill
whatsoever, and not even any luck once the pack of cards has been shuffled.

So it's a good job the interesting games of chance (backgammon etc.) are way
beyond the ability of the human mind to master in this way!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A statistical average of wins/looses ration will still
apply, but not for an individual game - the actual game
being played!

I'm slowly building the WAG site (200+ games right now),
where anyone can navigate in the Ocean of Games, but it's
an area of flat water, where nothing random or secret
appears to disturb the surface. With algorithmic evolution
(not just speed, speed is useless for Go), this part of
the Ocean will continuously grow smaller and smaller.

I wonder if, sometime, most of these games will have the
need for the Waves of Fortune...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Just because computers can play a game better than people, it doesn't follow
that people will stop playing and enjoying the game.  (Chess being a good
example of this (OK - for most people :))
