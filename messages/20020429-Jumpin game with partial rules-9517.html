Hi

I read once about a game (called Jumpin?) which was played
on a rectangular grid, with a setup similar to this one:

o o o o o o
o o o o o o
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
x x x x x x
x x x x x x

(I believe it was 6 by 11, but I may be wrong)

All stones had long jumps capability, and they could also jump
lines of 2+ stones (of either/mixed color) at one time, landing on
the next adjacent stone. After a jump, the stone could continue
to jump. There were no captures

The goal was to reach the opponent setup zone.

But something is missing on this game (e.g., how can I force the
opponent to get out of his own cells? perhaps jumps were
mandatory...)

Does anybody know this game?

Cheers,

Joao Neto
