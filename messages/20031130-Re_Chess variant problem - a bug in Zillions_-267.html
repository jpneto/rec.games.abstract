When Zillions plays my game against itself,

All of the pieces have symmetrical move possibilities,
including my "pawns" which can move (or capture)
backwards as well as forwards, so I have not needed
the Zillions "symmetry" command to make black's
"pawns" move in the reverse direction.

Maybe the absence of symmetry commands is the
reason for the differences in the play of white and black.

I assume that the move generation will be done in the order
of the statements that you have coded in your zrf.

If (for example) you write in your zrf for the "pawns"

  (moves
     (pawn-move n)
     (pawn-move s)
  )

then Zillions will generate with the white pawns:

  first the forwards (offensive) moves, and
  second the backwards (defensive) moves -

but for the black pawns this order is the contrary:
  defensive moves will be generated before the offensive moves.

This is exactly what was happening! It's taken me a while to recode the
script to use the symmetry command (for complicated reasons), but now that
I've done it, black and white seem to be winning equal amounts. Thank you so
much! You can't imagine how much time I wasted trying different starting
positions to find a fair one, when they were probably all fair...

Thanks also to Dan Troyka, whose advice was also useful.

P.S. It would be nice we  could seem your new game.

I will upload it to the Zillions site when I am sure everything is okay.
I'll email you to let you know when it happens. Thanks again!
