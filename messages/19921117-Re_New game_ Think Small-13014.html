First I will assume that every player is playing his/her own game and no one
is making a suicide effort to sabotage other people play (like the guy who
mail flooded the referee)

I will also assume all players are competent (i.e. they have read this post :-)

I will assume that no verified communication is allowed between players (i.e.,
players may talk - but you can't tell if they are telling the truth or lying).
If verified communication is allowed, then the first player to announce that
s/he had sent a 1 would make the game pointless for everyone else. I would
further assume that this is a one time game or that the prize is divided evenly
among the players if everybody loses (so no cooperation can be built among the
players to prevent that situation). It is easy to show that inter-player
communication is of no relevence (game-theoretically, psychologically is a
different story) as there is never a reason for a player to communicate any
significant information (since opponents are always free to ignore your
communications there is no way you could reduce the likelihood of opponents
victory by supplying them info - hence you can't improve your own).

Let N= number of players (if you don't know N, you can assign - based on your
best guess of the enviornment - probabilities to various plausible values of
N, and proceed from there).

Let P1, P2, ... be the probability with which you play 1,2,... when playing
                optimally. 

Since all players are competent, they will all use this strategy! hence the
probability of victory would be 1/N, regardless of which number <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play.

the probability "1" is the winning play = probability no one else plays "1":
1/N = (1-P1)^(N-1)       hence we can solve for P1.

the probability "2" is the winning play = probability no one else plays "2" and
at least 2 players played "1": (if both "1" and "2" win, we will assign the
probability to "1")
1/N = P1^2 * (1-P2)^(N-3)       hence we can solve for P2.

We can likewise solve for all other P's.

Once everyone uses this strategy, a new player joining the group would find 
that s/he is winning about 1/N of the games with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> strategy! However, if
a sizeable minority of players use a non-optimal strategy, they will find
themselves winning less than 1/N of the games in favor of the optimal one. If
player gradualy modify their strategy to favor those that have won them games
(an evolutionary scheme) than convergence to the optimal stratgey would occuer.
