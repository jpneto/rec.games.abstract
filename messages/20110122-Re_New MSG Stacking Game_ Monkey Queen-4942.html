I'm anticipating a change to Monkey Queen - a shift to a 10x10 board.  In
the original version of Monkey Queen, where the babies moved like Chess
kings, the 8x8 was too big.  The babies were slowly marching across the vast
board.  But now in MQ v2 the babies move like queens, not kings.  When you
have two queens moving around an 8x8 board, leaving queen-like babies
behind, it fills up fast.  Too fast.  Queens have a much further reach than
kings and they need a bigger playground to spread their wings in.

I'm also seeing a need for the pie rule.  It was already in the game, so far
unused, but it's going to be needed to counter Player 1's advantage of
having an extra half baby.  On a 10x10 the most balanced first moves will be
more balanced and more plentiful than on an 8x8.

I'm like Christian Freeling, stalking an elusive spirit  :D
