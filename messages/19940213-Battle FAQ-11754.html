take a look at the rules etc and mail me, theres a few places free in some
current games and if theres enough interest I have a willing GM for another

	This file contains some of the questions that are most commonly asked
of GMs by the players. If you have a query about the rules then please have
a look through this file first to see if its already been answered.
	Do not take this document as law, always look at the local rule
variations for the game you are playing. If your GM disagrees with any of the
decisions in this document s/he will state their ruling there.

--(=1=)-------------------------------------------------------(Introduction)--

	BATTLE is a play by mail strategy game with deadlines roughly every half
week depending on the GM. For those who have little time, it should take at most
about half an hour to think out your moves and mail them. Usually it doesnt
take more than about five minutes.
	The game is played with 12 players on a playing field made up of
hexagons. Each player has a base which has a certain amount of power and can
build and improve units. Units can be given attributes like move and attack
but these have to be researched first by the base. The aim of the game is to
eliminate the other players and be the last one surviving, games usually last
about thirty moves.

--(=2=)--------------------------------------------------(General Questions)--

--(=2.1=)------------------------------------------(How do I get the files?)--

	There are two methods for retrieving the files needed to play battle,
the first is to use the BatServ robot in IRC...

	Short instructions for operating batserv:

	/msg batserv list	-	A list of files you can retrieve
	/msg batserv send &lt;file&gt;-	Send you the file. You should
					type /dcc get batserv which will
					start the link.
	Other commands will be added soon and hell be neatened up, mail me
if you have any features you think should be added.

	Alternatively the files can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from
oozelum.csi.cam.ac.uk in /dist/Battle. Thanks to Nick McClaren for this service.
	A quick guide to using ftp, Im assuming you're on a UNIX system here 
because thats what I use, if not the messages may be slightly different but the
commands should be the same , if you are on a vax or something with filename
length restrictions you may have to replace 'get game16_status.txt' with
'get game16_status.txt status' which will save it on your system as status,
which is short enough. Everything you type below is marked with a ** before it -
dont type the **) And replace my email address with yours when asked for a
password.


** ftp oozelum.csi.cam.ac.uk

--(=2.2=)-------------------------------------------(How do I view the map?)--

	The map is in postscript format so there are usually two ways to look
at it - firstly the easiest and best is to just print it out. If youre unsure
how to do this ask someone in the know or go to your computing service. The
other method is if you can get access to a graphics terminal like an xterm,
then, depending on what operating system youre using you can view it with a
program like ghostview (for UNIX). Ghostview is also available for Windows.

--(=2.3=)-------------------------------------------------(Whats press for?)--

	Press is a means by which you can reach all the players instantly
with just a mail message. This can be used for pompous declarations of war or
peace or just for character building. Let your imagination roam free and do
a bit of role playing - the press doesn't count in the actual game but it adds
to the feel. To mail some press send the message to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mac18@cus.cam.ac.uk">mac18@cus.cam.ac.uk</a> with
the subject line pressX where X is the game number. Press can also be mailed
anonymously by sending it to the same address and asking (but don't make the
title pressX or it'll be forwarded!)

--(=3=)-----------------------------------------------------(Rules Queries)--

--(=3.1=)--------------------------------------------------------(Movement)--

	What happens if you have two adjectant pieces, neither of which
can attack, are they stuck there?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes, they are stuck there. Both can be considered to be attacking, but
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
without the capability (ie they do no damage). Any two adjacent enemy units must
stop and combat is mandatory, unless elite statuses are used.
	
.............................................................................

	Am I correct in assuming that a piece in combat cannot move away
(except using elite statuses), even if the piece it is in combat with moves away
on the same movement phase (using elite again)? What about if the other piece 
has moved away on a previous movement phase?


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes, you cannot disengage unless you use elite. If the piece moves away
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
using elite you cannot move away on the same phase unless you too use elite, but
on subsequent phases you can move

.............................................................................

	Take two pieces, one at height 0 and the other at height 1 in a C-wards
direction. The lower piece is ordered to move C and the upper piece F
(so in effect they swap places on the map) does this require elite (if they're
enemy pieces that is)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	No, they are not adjacent when they move, so no elite is necessary.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Note that if piece A has move 2 and piece B has move 1, they WILL become
adjacent once piece A has moved. The solution to this is for piece A to order
move 0C while piece B moves F so that they move in the same movement phase.

--(=3.2=)----------------------------------------------------------(Attack)--

        Suppose there are 2 units 1A12 &amp; 1B41 in adjacent hexes. They battle.
How is the battle run? Do they damage each other by 'attack' amounts each turn,
or is the battle fought to a conclusion in the turn that they meet?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	The former, they each do 'attack' damage on each other per turn
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

	If I have a unit with attributes 221 and it's attacking a unit with
attributes 132 then at the end of the turn, assuming the elite status isn't used
to run away or target attacks the two units end up as 110 and 022, don't they?
Or am I misunderstanding the attack rules?


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Correct, the attack is simultaneous, and piece 1 loses 3, 1 move, 1
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
attack, 1 elite, piece 2 loses 2, 1 move, 1 attack.

.............................................................................

	Can I specify that I dont want a unit to attack an adjectant enemy?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	It is possible to not attack a piece if you're adjacent to it, by using
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
elite to ignore adjectancy just like in the Move phase. Note that to attack a
piece with range when adjectant to an enemy piece takes two elite - one to
ignore the adjectancy and then another to split the attack between the two
pieces.

.............................................................................

	Can one use elite to attack with less than one's full strength?
	
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes, but it takes two elite to do so, one to split, and one to ignore
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
adjacency of the bit you don't want to attack. Note that if you are adjacent to
more than one unit, it takes one elite to split (assuming you wish to only
attack <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> unit at less than full strength, and waste the rest of your attack)
, and one elite to ignore EACH of the adjacent units. Eg. if you are surrounded
by three units, and wish to attack one of them at less than full strength and
ignore the rest, you must use a total of four elite. If you wish to attack two
of them (but still not use all your attack) you need 5 elite : two for splitting
, 3 for ignoring.

--(=3.3=)-----------------------------------------------------------(Elite)--

	Can two elite 1 pieces combine to work as an elite 2 piece?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

--(=3.4=)---------------------------------------------------------(Storage)--

	If I build a unit with movement and storage and then put power into it, 
I assume I can do all this in one turn.  Can I then, however, also in the same
turn move the unit, and transfer the power out of it?  It would be nice, but I
guess it's not possible.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Correct. You can build it, but since build comes before movement, once
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the piece has moved, it can no longer build.

.............................................................................

	Can you build a unit with storage, fill it, and then use that stored
power to build up another unit?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes. See above.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

1)	Can pieces use stored power to modify themselves?
2)	Can you use stored power passing to do part of an attribute? Each to
increase something from 1 to 2 can you put in one point from the base and
one point of passed power from a neighbouring piece?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	1) Yes  2) Yes, since this is effectively a power chain and chains are
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
instantaneous so all the power is in one place and usable. Also power can be
passed through a base to do this as if the base had infinite storage.

.............................................................................

	Can a piece which has 1 power storage, with 2 points of power stored
do the following...
	1) Pass 2 points of power along a chain
	2) Get 2 more in from another source as a refill
	3) Use the new 2 power to upgrade (not pass power to, but upgrade) a
neighbour?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	1) Yes  2) Yes  3)  No
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

--(=3.5=)----------------------------------------------------(Power Chains)--

        Given this scenario:

	NOTQUITEREAL  Random Player  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:user@ideal.world.gov">user@ideal.world.gov</a>
	  Base A1       Research Level:4        Power:11
	  1A1111/0  A2
	  2A1111/0  A3
	  3A1111/0  A4
	  4A1       A5

1)	Would it be possible to transmit 2 power down the line to 4A giving it
  Attack &amp; Elite 1?
2)	Would it be possible to transmit 2 power down the line to 4A giving it
  Attack &amp; Elite 1 and leave 2 power in each of 1A,2A,3A?
3)	Would it be possible to transmit 11 power down the line to 4A giving it
  Attack, Elite &amp; Storage 2 with 2 stored power?   If not then would it be
  possible to increase 1A to storage 2, pass power to 1A &amp; increase 2A to
  storage 2, pass power to 2A and increase 3A to storage 2, then pass 4 power
  down the chain to give 4A Attack 2 &amp; Elite 1?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	1) Yes  2) No  3) No  4) No, but some of that is possible.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	The basic idea about power chains (I know this isn't detailed very well
in the rules) is that a unit can have storage built in it and pass on power in
the same build phase, but a unit can only give and/or receive the max amount of
power it can handle ONCE in each build phase. ie A unit can start off a turn
with stored power, give it and then receive it from another source again that
phase, but not pass on the second lot of power. Similarly an empty unit can
pass on one lot of power, but not receive a second lot.

.............................................................................

        Can you move power up and down (in chains or from a base)?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Power may only be passed down, allowing passing up makes it far too easy
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
to build hardhats, etc., but it was agreed to allow passing down to facilitate
repair of tunnelling units.

--(=3.6=)------------------------------------------------------(Conversion)--

	Can a piece convert two pieces in one turn, by splitting its convert?
Could this be done by expending an extra elite to perform the split (as in
splitting attacks?)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	A unit can split its convert, no elite is needed 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

	Is it possible for 2+ units to gang up &amp; pool their convert whilst
attempting to convert others, or is it purely a 1:1 thing. If not, what if
1X1000/0 2, 2X1000/0 2,1Y1000/0 2 all attempt to convert 1Z1 at the same time?
Do 1X &amp; 1Y 'Stand off' whilst 2X converts successfully?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Units of the same faction can pool to effect a conversion.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

--(=3.7=)----------------------------------------------------(Construction)--

	In the rules it sates (under Hover) that "The perimeter wall is at all
heights but interior walls only start at height 0."

1)	Do the walls between bases, ie between M and A count as interior walls?
2)	Do the walls surrounding the +5 hex count as interior walls?
3)	Can these walls be 'removed' by construction units?
4)	Can the perimeter walls be 'removed' by construction units (by removing
  the wall at the bottom the rest falls down...)?  (not that there's much
  point in this...)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	1) Yes  2) Yes  3) Yes  4) No
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

	Can a piece build or destroy a wall more than once in the same turn
if it has more than one construct?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes, in the event of two pieces doing opposing things then the the one
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
using more levels of construction will succeed.

--(=3.8=)---------------------------------------------------------(Defence)--

	No questions!

--(=3.9=)-------------------------------------------------------(Explosion)--

	Is explosion blocked by defence?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	No, this may vary in some games see the local rule variations.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

--(=3.10=)------------------------------------------------------(Tunneling)--

	If a piece tunnels into a hex causing a wall to fall down, can another
piece move 'through' that wall on the same movement phase?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Yes, the jusitification is the following: the movement phase can b
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
thought to consist of three subphases:
	1. Any pieces of earth needing to be removed for tunnelling are removed
and any walls falling down fall down now.
	2. All the pieces are moved
	3. Any piece without sufficient hover to stay where they are fall.


Perhaps the following illustration would be helpful.  (This is a side view)
                         _____
                        W     |        In the case where X moves to the left
                        W  Z  |       then both walls (W) fall down.  Z and
        _______         W_____|       Y can the move through where the walls
        |      W    |||||             were the following movement phase.
        |  Y   W    |||||
        |______W    |||||
               |||||     |
               |||||  X  |
               |||||_____|

.............................................................................

	Is it possible to tunnel under a base?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	No
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

--(=3.11=)----------------------------------------------------------(Range)--

	If two pieces are separated by one range and there is a wall directly
along their line of sight (eg a piece at L7 and on at M9 with a wall at L8A)
do the pieces have los on each other.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	 No the wall blocks the los.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

	Exactly how does line of sight work?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Draw a straight line between the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>centres<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> of the two pieces involved,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
and look at all the hexes it goes through (define hex here as a location a piece
can sit in, ie A4 and A4+1 are distinct hexes). Look at all the hexes it goes
through: if there's a piece in any of them or a wall at the point it goes
between two hexes then the shot is blocked.
	Trouble starts when you attempt to shoot along lines which go through
points on the boundaries of more than two hexes. There are two possibilities for
this: either (a) you shoot along an edge of a hex, or (b) you shoot through a
point which is on one of the top edges or bottom edges of a hex.
	In case (a), you need to look at what happens just left or just right
of the line. If either is clear, then you can see the target.
	Case (b) only arises when you're shooting down one of the 6 compass
directions and also requires (x-height difference)/(y height difference) to be
either an odd integer or the reciprocal of an odd integer. In this case, you
look at what happens just above and just below the line.

	The following is useful: if you're trying to hit a piece, if you're
higher up than you are further away, then you need to have a clear line to the
top of the piece, if you're lower down then you need to have a clear line to the
side of the piece. If you're equally high up and far away (which means you need
to be shooting down one of the compass directions), then you can do it either
way.

--(=3.12=)----------------------------------------------------------(Hover)--

	At what points do units which have had their flying gear shot to bits
fall out of the sky.  Before or after the conversion phase?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Before
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

.............................................................................

	If a piece with two hover moves over a piece that is hovering at a
height 0 over a 2 deep hole with only two hover, does the lower piece fall?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Two pieces vertically adjectant only fall until the lower piece is at
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
its hover limit, hence the piece can move on top with only two hover and
doesn't fall.

--(=3.13=)--------------------------------------------------------(General)--

	Please confirm that it is possible to make your movement orders
conditional on other players' builds.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	This is possible since the movement phase is after Build and so can be
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
conditional on what happened.

.............................................................................

	How are points restored to bases which have been attacked? Say someone
knocks 3 points of somoene's base.. how much does it cost to get back to full
power? Is it 1+2+3 or 8+9+10 or...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	The former.  Also, you don't need to do it in one turn.  if you are down
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
6, you could regenerate 3 then 2 then 1 over 3 turns at a total cost of 6+3+1 =
10.
