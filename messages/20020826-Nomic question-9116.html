Hi there,

I've searched online a few places that I can join some Nomic
discussion. I've only found the Agora discussion list and
alt.games.nomic.* (which is dead due to large amounts of SPAM it
seems). Most resources point to this newsgroup, so maybe someone in
here would be willing to help me with a question I have. I hope you
don't mind my posting.

Here's 2 situations of a Nomic game. It seems that these loopholes
might arise and I'm wondering if I've misinterpreted something (or
just that a certain level of honour is expected when playing). In both
situations, the turn sequence is (player A then B then C ... then F
then A then B).

1. Let's say player B is sick of the game and "teams up" with player
C. Player C states tat rule #30x states that the next player to roll
the die wins. Rule #30x is something completely different, so all the
players disagree about the legality of the move, but player B is the
judge (rule 212). Player B, because he wants to concede the game,
judges the move legal and gives player C the game.

2. Player C has 94 points and rolls a 6 to give him 100 points.
Everyone disagrees on the legality of the rule that states that player
C should win. The judge, player B, not wanting player C to win judges
that the application of the point rule was illegal, so that player C
remains at 94 points and does not win. This can happen over and
over...


Thanks,
Marc
