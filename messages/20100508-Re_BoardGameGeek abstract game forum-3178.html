I also support, in principle, an organization like IAGO, but I am
uneasy with Richard Hutnik's attempt to subsume all existing chess
variants into something he calls "IAGO Chess."  Seems intellectually
dishonest to me, the act of someone who wants to possess rather than
to promote.  I hope that his desire to define and classify everything
doesn't mean that this is where he wants to go with abstact games also.

Have you looked over what "IAGO Chess" is?  And your response is
similar to what what I got from the British Chess Variant Society when
it was run by them.  If you looked at it, you would see what it is
trying to do.  At the heart of it was an attempt to have the community
of variant players create a path for chess to continually evolve,
taking what the variant community had to offer.  It was to make
variants more acceptable.  It did provide a framework and a suggestion
as to the path this could happen, but was open to change.  It was
stuck under IAGO, the way FIDE has normal Chess.  In short, it wasn't
supposed to be something that one person owned, but the community of
players owned, and IAGO recognized it.  Levels of irony came out from
this.

The irony here is that I ended up having to do far more work on it as
I should, and apparently the variant community wasn't ready to work
towards standardizing its names to foster its growth, or make it so
that it gets accepted and more mainstream.  The end result is speed
chess is the next chess, and the variant community is seen as a bunch
of freaks by the rest of the world.

Anyhow, IAGO is meant to belong to all people interested in abstract
strategy games.  And on that note, if you do support what IAGO is in
principle, may I ask that you actually help give input into how it is
doing things, or at least team up with other people and start a rival
organization that would supplant IAGO?

The attempt to standardize the work of others, apply neologisms, and
use it as a basis for what you perceived as the evolution of chess
variants amounted, in my view, to the co-opting of the creative
efforts of others.  If a variant is ever created that is compelling
and brilliant enough to compete with orthodox chess it will not be the
result of a classification bureacracy.  It's all moot anyway, because
it seems to me that the CV community is now intellectually bankrupt --
the same small number of people recycling old ideas, pushing their own
individual obsessions, releasing an endless stream of bad games just
for the sake of having their names on as many "inventions" as
possible.  I used to be a frequent contributor at chessvariants.org
but I don't pay much attention anymore.  I fear that IAGO will be a
step in the same direction for abstract games.
