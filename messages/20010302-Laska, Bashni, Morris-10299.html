Hi,


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
BTW I would like to recommend "Abstract Games", this magazine is well
worth its price!!!

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I read the whole afternoon in the five issues of "Abstract Games" instead
to work (i'm writing a book about abstract board games).

This magazine is amazing.

(1)
I only found some minor problems. Laska was spelled Lasca which adds to
the confusion that already tortures us. I also doubt the spelling of
Bashne (often called Bashni). The name of this game is Russian and means
"tower". The last letter is pronounced between 'e' and 'a' und the
official transcription (as explained in the introductions of my Russian
dictionaries and text books) is 'a' !!!!!
So I assume that it should be written "Bashna"? Is there anybody
who has studied Russian?


(2) Concerning a letter published in issue 3, page 2:

" Pentagonia. (...) I must say we were a little disappointed in the
review. While we agree that the game is not terribly original, we felt
that the rule changes we have made in Pentagonia have produced a game that
is much more fluid and dynamic and fun than its Men's Morris ancestors.
(...) In addition, as those who play's Men's Morris games a lot know, the
first move advantage in these games is quite significant. The player to
move second is rarely able to make the game close, let alone win. (...)"


I am living in Germany and Morris (called Mühle) could be called our
true national game because in Germany it is more popular than Chess or
Dame (German Draughts). We have many very strong players and even
tournaments. I am probably one of the strongest players in my city.
I speak of traditional German Nine Men Morris.

Among strong players Morris games end almost always in a draw so that the
first prize in Morris tournaments is almost always shared by several
players. There are even Morris tournaments for the blind.

Two of Germany's leading players are Hans Schürmann and Manfred
Nüschler. They wrote in 1980 the book: "So gewinnt man Mühle" (How to win
Morris). This is one of the best books ever written about Morris. They
show that there is no first move advantage. In fact, the second player has
an advantage because it is more important where to place the last stone
than the first stone in the opening. A player who makes a Mühle
(three-in-a-row) rather early usually loses the game! Morris is a game of
position and strategy and you must try to control at least two of the four
four-four-intersections of the board or you will lose.
Pentagon is like "Fünfeck-Mühle" (five corner morris) and Armenian Morris
mixed together. Armenian Morris gives a sure win for the first player
while Fünfeck-Mühle has a big second move advantage. Perhaps Pentagon
balances both drawbacks so that both players have an equal chance to win.

I would like to see more advanced German Morris variants like "Windmühle"
or "Rautenmühle" to be more used in tournaments. These two variants are
much more difficult to play and both are rather old.
