A player could come up with a rule like


... where (k = 1 and is to the right of, and on the same line as a 3, 6,
and 7, to the left of 2,2, 3, and 4, and below a 6) OR (k = 2 and is to the
right of on the same line as a 1 and 4, to the left of a 5,5,7,7,and 8) OR
...

And tailor each individual clause to specify any particular subset of
numbers as scoring.  So ultimately, the game might as well be:

- Each player gives a score from 0 to n to every player (including
him/her self).  Final score is the sum of all received scores.

Maybe rules would be limited in how many letters/numbers they take to
write in English.
Or maybe the rules should be written down before the numbers are
placed on the line, but each player's rule is kept secret until after
all the numbers are placed.

Would either/both of these modifications work?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
