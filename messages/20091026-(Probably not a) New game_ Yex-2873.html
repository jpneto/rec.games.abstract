I'm probably not the first person to suggest this, but, going on with
the discussion on the HEXA-Y problem...

YEX

Yex is a two player connection game played on a hex-hex board. Before
starting the game, three non-consecutive corner cells (A, C and E, for
instance) are marked in some way, thus dividing the board perimeter
into three "sections". The marked cells belong to its two adjacent
sections.

The game starts on an empty board. Each player has stones of his
allocated color: white or black. In their turn, starting with Black,
players put one stone on a vacant cell. The player who connects the
three sections with a single chain of his stones wins. Draws are not
possible in Yex, and, as in Y (I hope I will be right this time) a
randomly filled board always produces one, and only one, winner.

Of course, this is simply Y played on a board whose corners have been
truncated to make it hexagonal. The advantage of this game over Y is
the more, say, harmonic board; the disadvantage, the artificial
marking of three corner cells.

Has anyone ever tried this game?
