In a case, for example, where the

There is also the way that boardspace.net handles it, by a pie rule.
Make the first move, or even rearrange the pieces as you see fit, and
let the other player decide which side to play. This preserves balance
excellently, and also tielessness.

Ahh, thanks.  Well, that works if you know one side for sure is
unbalanced.  What happens in the case where you aren't sure which side
has an advantage, like in Chess960?  Or, in a case where say someone
came up with a brand new abstract strategy game without sufficient
play, and wants to play it in a tournament somewhere?  Do you see the
Pie Rule as being one that can also be applied to the weaker side?
