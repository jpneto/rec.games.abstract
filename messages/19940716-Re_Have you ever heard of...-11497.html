 This is only semi-related, being about a meta-game, but I really 
enjoyed a boardgame called Proteus, which was a variant on tic-tac-toe 
with the rules on the pieces, and only three rules in effect at any time. 
It was almost impossible to think more than a move ahead, but that was 
actually part of its charm...

	The same company which sells Proteus (Kadon Enterprises) also sells
a game called Lemma. With Lemma, you get a board and pieces. Each player's
turn consists of adding a rule to the growing list of rules, then making a
move to demonstrate that rule. The rules have to refer only to the board and
pieces. 
	Just so happens I have Kadon's address handy. Kadon is known pri-
marily for an excellent selection of high-quality geometric puzzles, but they
have some good games too, like Proteus, Lemma, and Kaliko (formerly Psyche-
Paths). You can get a catalog.
