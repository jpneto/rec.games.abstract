I thought Mao was the game also known as Eleusis. It goes roughly like this.

Mao is a related game, but it is NOT Eleusis.
Mao is like life.  You go into it not knowing the rules, but you are penalized
for breaking them anyway. 

It is played with a standard deck of cards, with a "dealer" who knows all of
the rules, and players who may or may not know the rules.  The players a re
told that thay play number on number, suit on suit (like Uno), and the
objective is to get rid of all your cards.

Rules can be something like "on the play of a five the direction of play
reverses" or "any player who plays the queen of spades must say 'Agora Agora'"
or "when a player has two cards left, e may give two cards to any player of eis
choice", etc.

There are many different "flavors" of Mao that I know of, each with a different
ruleset.  Some are relatively simple, some frustratingly complex, and some
silly (like one where every rule involves saying phrases from The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy).

In some games, anyone who "goes out" (runs out of cards) may make up a rule for
the other players to follow - in other games, play simply ends until the next
day.  It depends on the dealer.

It is taboo to talk about the rules.  This is a social game, where the fun
generally lies in seeing newbies stumble through the game and amass a huge pile
of cards.
