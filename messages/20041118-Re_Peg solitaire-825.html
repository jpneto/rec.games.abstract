<br>I assume one of these is Winning Ways, Vol. 4.&nbsp; What's the other one? 
Volume 4 is only $40 at Amazon.com, not too bad if you're serious about 
the subject; I don't think volume four assumes too much familiarity with 
the earlier volumes.&nbsp; You might also want to check local university 
libraries (if any, many people overlook these although they are 
generally open to the public).
<br>

<br>A pagoda function is a function defined over the board so that no jump 
can increase the value of the board.&nbsp; So, if the desired ending position 
is one peg in the center, and this position has value 1, any position 
with a value less than 1 is bad.&nbsp; The function doesn't change for 
different peg configurations, but one can use multiple pagoda functions 
to prune the search tree probably much faster than what you are doing. 
I don't know if there are algorithms to develop pagoda functions for 
arbitrary sized boards, that might be an interesting area of research.

<br>I work as a C++ programmer and have been reading Winning Ways off and on 
for almost a year (though I still have much to learn), so if you have 
any specific questions, just ask.
