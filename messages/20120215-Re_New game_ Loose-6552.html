The game Loose is indeed a variant of Go, but it's original in its
definition of a false liberty --- a defintion which is crucial to the
mechanics.  I agree with Nate that the distinction between true and
false liberties quickly becomes intuitive, which is a good thing.  I
played through your sample game.  There are some moves (e.g 42 and 43,
63 and 64) which seem essentially to be the same move --- there is the
actual placement and then there's the consequence of that placement.
The only move/moves that confuse me are 72 and 73; I'm not sure what
is happening there.

Also one question about the rules.  You state that "at the end of the
turn, every group on board must have at least one true libery."   I
think you mean that this includes the stone that was just placed?  If
this is so, it seems to follow that one true liberty grants
unconditional life.  If it's not what you mean, then it seems to
follow that two true liberties are required.

The moves that confused you are just a consequence of using SGF, a
format designed to store Go games, to play Loose. The move pairs 42-43
and 63-64 are actually single moves, but I had to enter them in two
steps because of the limitations of the SGF system. 73 is a complete
move in itself: white places at b3 (which would be illegal in Go) and
flips Black's group at once.

As for the rules question, see this example:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=91293&amp;sid=3b11ce6233">http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=91293&amp;sid=3b11ce6233</a>....

Here, White has just one true liberty. When Black fills it, White's
group is flipped. At the end of the turn, Black's group (the only
group on the board) complies with the requirement of having at least
one true liberty (it has plenty of them), so Black's move was legal.

Note that not all true liberties are eyes, but all eyes are true
liberties. A group needs 2 eyes to live unconditionally, as in Go.- Hide quoted text -

O.K. that clears things up.  Thanks!
