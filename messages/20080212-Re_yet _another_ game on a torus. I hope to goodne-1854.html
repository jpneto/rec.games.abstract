That game's OK, but it falls down on one of the criteria
we have been chasing after, for connection games.

Namely, the criterion of Win/Loss complementarity.
That is; that to permanently prevent one's opponent
from making a winning position, is EQUIVALENT to
making one of one's own.

Or alternatively written; if the board is completely filled
with stones, then exactly one person must have won,
regardless of the order in which the stones were played.

i.e. again; the winning criteria are STATIC rather than DYNAMIC.

Games without this feature, such as your own,
may still be very playable, but are much more in the nature
of "race games", wherein both can achieve a victory position,
but whoever does it first, wins.  There is nothing wrong with this,
but it is just not usually considered as part of the Connection
game tradition.
