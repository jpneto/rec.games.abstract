I have DVONN and YINSH and I was wondering about how games in this series 
are combined. Since "GIPF" is referred to as the "Central" game in the 
series, do you need to have it to combine games? And if you have GIPF along 
with, say, DVONN or YINSH do you need to buy anything else to combine them?

Also, I notice the claim that YINSH is actually the 6th game in the series, 
and the 5th will be coming out last. Does it actually matter what "order" 
the games are in? If so, why?

Sorry if these are FAQs for this group.
