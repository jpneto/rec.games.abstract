Hi, 

i need a (good) bound to the maximum branching factor in peg solitaire game.

I know that, if we play on n x n boards, i could say that 4n^2 is an upper
bound, but i need a better and more realistic upper bound...).

Any peg will have to move to an empty space, so you have two upper
bounds:

 1) Each peg can move to at most four empty spaces, so 4*P is an upper
    bound, where P is the number of remaining pegs.

 2) Each empty hole can have at most four pegs moving to it, so 4*H
    is an upper bound, where H is the number of empty holes.

H+P is the size S of the board (i.e., the total number of holes, full
or empty).  So an upper bound is 4*min(H,P) &lt;= 2*S.

On a finite board, we can't reach this upper bound, as pieces on the
edges can only move in two or three directions and holes can only
receive moves from two or three directions.

Even assuming a wrap-around board, where there is no edges, the limit
can not be achieved: A peg that can move in four directions must be
surrounded with four pegs and four holes, as in the picture:

    O
    X
  OXXXO
    X
    O

where X is a peg and O a hole.  But each of the four pegs surrounding
the middle can move at most in two directions.  For example, the top X
can not move up, as there is no peg to jump and it can't move down, as
there is no hole to jump to.  So you can, obviously, can't have four
moves available for all pegs.  I think an average of two is the best.
It is, however, possible to have four moves available to all empty
holes, for example if there is only one empty hole in the middle of
the board.  So it seems likely that the maximumis achieved when
4*H=2*P, i.e., when 2/3 of all holes are filled.

The best pattern I can come up with for maximizing moves is:

   OXXOXX
   XOXXOX
   XXOXXO
   OXXOXX
   XOXXOX
   XXOXXO

which, as expected, has 2/3 of all holes filled and two moves for
every peg (assuming wrap-around), so 4/3*S moves total.  I have no
proof that this is a hard limit, but I believe so.
