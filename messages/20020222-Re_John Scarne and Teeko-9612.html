Ralf, Ralf... why so tense? Are you that serious a Scarne/Teeko fan?
"Your view is rather superficial?" One could argue that your view that
celebrities would only support products they truly believe in and
would <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> "prostitute" themselves is fairly superficial. You have
seen a "infomercial" before, right? People do all kinds of stuff for
money - including people who have lots of money.

As for Teeko....

Teeko was heavily pushed by Scarne, no doubt about it. Does that mean
the game's alleged popularity was bogus? No. But it could be. Is Teeko
the best thing since sliced bread? Perhaps - to some people. Is it
better that all other games? To some, sure.

But let's not get ugly while discussing such things, 'kay?
