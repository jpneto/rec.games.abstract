Hex Pentominoes 

About pentominoes look here :
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.coolmagnetman.com/pent.htm">http://www.coolmagnetman.com/pent.htm</a>

Instead of stones players use pentominoes.
Each player has 120 pentominoes (12 shapes multiplied by 10 copies).
Each one has a coloured pentominoes : one plays with Red and the other with Blue.
Goal of the game : the first player to connect its sides is the winner.
Board : square grid 10x10

Rules :
At the setup the board is empty.
Choose who plays first. 
Red player start the game and players take their turn alternatively.

On his turn a player places any of his 120 pentominoes on an empty square in the board 10x10.
Each pentominoe placed on the board can not be removed or manipulated.
No pentominoes overlapping is allowed.
The turn finishes when a pentominoe is placed.
Pentominoes are connected when they share at least one side.
The game ends when one of player connect its sides.

Are you willfully hypocritical? Unlike Connecticut, this is a terrible idea. Hex is already an exquisitely functional game, this will only mar it. Meanwhile Connecticut minus triominoes is fundamentally broken. Connecticut is one more valid response to the square board connection problem while this only mars a brilliant game like Hex. Even more so than your last idiotic mutation of that landmark game.

Valid reponse? ha ha ha 
I will not comment on trivial solutions like Connecticut.
The square board connection problem is not a problem at all.
The real and deep problem is the Hex game itself. 
Rethinking ALL the game is required. But game designers are busy to solve imaginary problems instead of creating new concepts.
