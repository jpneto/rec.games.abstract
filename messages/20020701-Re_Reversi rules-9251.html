I've never heard of the "exactly one" variant.  That does not
mean that such a variant does nto exist.  However, every version

Indeed.  It is easy to misunderstand the rules if they are briefly
described and no examples are provided.  When first I learned Othello
from the rules in the box, I initially thought that you would apply
the flipping rule all over the board, not just at the newly placed
piece.  So, anywhere a line of the opposite colour was between two
pieces of t eplayers colour, the line would be flipped.  I very
quickly discovered my mistake (some of the examples on the box
contradicted it), but I can understand how such a mistake can happen.

I know from experience that it isn't enough that the rules are precise
and complete.  People who read them will overlook or forget rules and
if they don't check the rules again after the first reading, they will
continue playing with the wrong rules.  If the rules are incomplete,
it is even worse, as different playing groups will make different
assumptions, so it can be hard to establish a unique common rule set
for the game.
