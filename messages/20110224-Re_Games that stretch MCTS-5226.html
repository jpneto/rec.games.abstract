Definitely there is low clarity in Flume, especially in the opening game,
exactly like Dots and Boxes.  The tree is so vastly branched that there's no
point in wasting thought on it, in the opening.  Flume opening play amounts
to randomly setting up the board.

Flume is considered to be my best game by some, including perhaps me.  When
the low clarity, random setup phase ends and the thinking phase begins,
there's no deeper game.

Low clarity is not a general purpose mudball to sling at a game.  Low
clarity is the flip side of high complexity, something crucial to making
certain games tick, like Flume.

I read Bruce Abramson's book many years ago and tried to apply it to Tanbo,
not a good game for Monte Carlo.  But the concept stuck with me, and I had
already thought of Monte Carlo as being a potentially excellent technique
for cutting through the fog in Flume.
