This might be an interesting game -- I can't quite tell if it is, although
2-player strategies spring readily to mind.   For large n and many 
players, I don't see any obvious ways to use skill to improve one's
score, and imagine that most players will get a score of 2 or 3 per
offense round, and the winner will be that one person in 10 or 20
who randomly happens to score 4, 5, or more.

Following are frequencies of scores from 1 to 10 when the initial list of 
1's and 0's is a random number with n bits, based on trials with 100 
million random numbers per trial.  (Repeated trials give results that vary, 
typically,  in the third or fourth significant digit.)  For example, when 
n=30, about one-half percent of the random binary numbers gave a score 
of 1, about 50.4% gave a score of 2, 24.45% a score of 3, and so forth.

Score...    1       2         3         4       5        6        7      8       9       10   ...
n=24:  0.6575 51.60 25.78 10.83 4.595 1.724 1.285 1.130 0.958 0.738 ...
n=25:  0.6121 51.30 25.75 11.13 4.990 1.725 1.110 0.990 0.862 0.709 ... 
n=27:  0.5666 50.79 25.42 11.59 5.821 1.930 0.866 0.744 0.670 0.593 ...
n=30:  0.5091 50.40 24.45 11.96 6.881 2.589 0.823 0.477 0.438 0.401 ...
n=31:  0.4894 50.38 24.05 12.00 7.156 2.846 0.891 0.419 0.377 0.347 ...

Note, as the only time for strategy is when writing down the initial
string S of 1's and 0's, if effective strategies exist the game's outcome
depends on how S is written down.  There are dozens of ways that 
can be done,  depending on when new and/or previously appended bits 
are revealed and on number of bits appended at once.   Here's an 
interesting possibility:  Suppose there are p players.   Let the p-1 
non-offense players each contribute a bit; then reveal the result; 
and then the offense player gets to append p-1 bits at once.  
Repeat until S has n=2*k*(p-1) bits in it, for some small k.
