  Re: Sprouts

  Someone posted an article requesting strategy for the topological game
  sprouts. Here's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> strategy - it may not be all that great, but it's
  at least maybe sort of a bit on the right track.

  Say you're playing sprouts with 7 dots and you're moving first. Well, 
  you know that a sprouts game can last at most 3n-1 moves (n=number of
  starting dots), or 20 moves in this case. Since you're moving first,
  you want the game to last an odd number of moves. So, you make a 
  table of numbers of possible moves for the game: 20, 19, 18, 17, 16,
  etc. (I believe the minimum # of moves in sprouts is 2n or 2n+1).
  Now, each time a new 'stranded dot' is created, cross off the highest
  number on the list. New stranded dots are created every time you
  chop the playing field up into 2 areas that are each guarenteed to
  contain a dot that is not totally used up by the game's end.

  Try to get to the part of the game where no more dots can be
  stranded with an odd number at the head of the list.

  Beware of creating semi-stranded dots that give your opponant the
  option of actually stranding a dot or not (Ex: picture a circle with
  4 dots on the perimeter, and with other stuff outside the circle.)
  There are cases when you'd want to do this, but be careful.

  This isn't so much a strategy as it is a way of deciding what type of
  move to make: a non-stranded-dot move (ex: connect 2 points), a
  stranded dot move (ex: encircle an open point), or a semi-stranded
  dot move (ex: connect a point to itself, now your opponant has the
  option of connecting the 2 dots on the inside or outside of the
  circle).
