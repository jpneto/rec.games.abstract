I'm sure this will sound a little weird, but here goes:

I've been into chess off and on all my life, and right now I'm on an up
cycle.  Lately I've also gotten interested in checkers (draughts),
another recurrent interest.  But I have a thing about doing things in
threes--so I'm wondering what other game would naturally complete this
set.  If I were going to focus on just three abstract (perfect
information, randomizer-free) board games, which game would go best
with chess and checkers?

For the sake of simplicity, I'm sticking to Western (FIDE) chess and
English/American 8x8 checkers.  I've managed to convince myself that
these are the standard versions of the game, despite the realities of
shogi, xiangqi, "international checkers," and all the other variants
and regional standards.

But I'm at a loss to find a third game that seems to naturally fit with
the two I've chosen.

One wild thought was backgammon--just because board-game sets often
come with components for chess, checkers, and backgammon.  It used to
be so common for a backgammon board to be printed on the back of the
board that came with popular boxed checkers sets that someone wrote a
backgammon book called The Other Side of the Checkerboard.  But alas,
backgammon has randomizers (dice).  It's another Western game, and it
has ancient roots, but due to the dice, it doesn't really make the cut.

Another thought is go.  But I'm probably thinking of that just because
it's enjoying such popularity nowadays.  It fits in some ways, but it's
an Eastern game, and it's much bigger (in its standard 19x19-line
version) than chess or checkers.  It seems to come from a different
tradition.

Mancala might be a possibility, but again it comes from a different
tradition and thus doesn't seem like a natural fit.

I've thought of tablut and the tafl family of games, but they strike me
as kind of a nordic anomaly rather than a widely popular game with the
kind of tradition that chess and checkers enjoy.

So far, the likeliest contender seems to be nine men's morris.  The
morris (or merels) games do have a long history, and they've been
popular in many of the same regions as chess and checkers.

Another reason NMM seems like a good possibility is that it's quite a
different game than chess or checkers.  The uninitiated often
mistakenly believe that chess and checkers are similar, just because
they share the same board (but actually they don't; checkers uses
different parts of the board in different ways and could use a
different board altogether).  But chess is a sort of capture-the-flag
(king) game, whereas checkers is a game of elimination/blocking.  The
fact that they're so different is what makes me interested in both (I
can't get very interested in games like xiangqi or shogi, since I
already know chess).  And NMM is yet a different kind of game--a
three-in-a-row game.

At the same time, all these games do have something in common.  NMM is
also a game of elimination/blocking like checkers; and elimination and
blocking occur in chess as well, even if it's not the final objective.

OK, I'm done with my little ramble.  Sorry if I bored you.  If you have
any thoughts, let me know.
