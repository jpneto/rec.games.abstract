Have you any old trivial pursuit sets, or know of any?

It seems to me that the pie-shaped pieces would be ideal for this sort of
thing.  Plus, the little wedges come in 6 colors (blue, pink, brown, yellow,
green, orange), as do the round pieces, or you could paint them.  Perhaps you
could use a modified version, i.e. have different combos of wedges mean
different things... strength and decay.  Or maybe you could stack them such
that a pie piece in various states of being filled is decay level 0-6, and a
pie piece on top of a checkers piece is an additional 6 (as if the checkers was
a filled pie piece), thus 7-11.  Then the colors could deal with the strenght,
or something.  Of course, with 22 total pieces, this is almost 4 triv. pursuit
sets, so maybe it's not such a good idea.

oh well.
