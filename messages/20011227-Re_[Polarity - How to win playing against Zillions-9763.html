Hi, Folks!

I'm fond of various draughts games. I've been very glad to see
Polarity (in Zillions). It has some new conceptions (for me) mixing ordinary
and losing
games.

I'm glad you enjoyed it.

I found that the following simple (or deep?) strategy always(?) beats
Zillions: try to play <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>losing<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> draughts to lose your minuses!

You win very quick playing first, and not so quick playing second.

I'm not sure if you've found here a flaw within the game itself or are simply
exploiting one of the weaknesses of the Zillions program.

But it cannot be true! What player is winner in the starting position?
Or, maybe, it's the draw position? I know there is draw positions in
some losing games, for instance russian poddavki (russian losing
draughts - my favorite one).

The draw condition for Polarity is if on the final move a player captures all
of his opponent's pieces, and so meets both the winning and losing conditions
simultaneously.  

I accidentally left the draw condition out of the original ZRF but fixed the
file a little bit later.  You might want to download the file again to make you
have the more up to date ZRF.
