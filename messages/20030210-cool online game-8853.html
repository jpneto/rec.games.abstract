I thought you guys might be interested in this, the group you are in is
related to this.
each time a link is clicked that person gets an army....
but it has to be a different person in no less than 24 hours
so click every day

you all should know about my new online entertainment system
K1NGS OF CHA0S.... it's like Lord of the Rings era
army warfare, nothing spectacular, wars are fought by numbers and
probabilities.
(Ex. 200 soldiers with warhammers and chainmail will destroy 100 soldiers
with their bare hands)
now here is the thing, I get a soldier for everytime my link is clicked

if you wanna be my officer instead of a soldier, you gotta put in your name,
e-mail (confirmed), and race
an officer is just another person who makes their own army, then I get some
benefits of my officer's army too.
(if you guys just go through and click on those links down there every 24
hours, I would be very very happy)
if you don't want to be involved, just don't click the link, and ignore this
post

join army link, to be my officer)
