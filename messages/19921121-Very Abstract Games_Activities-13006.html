Granted, this "game" doesn't really qualify as a game.  There is no objective and
everyone's a winner, but it is great fun.

The Sentence Game
-----------------

This is played with a group of 4-7 people with 5 being about the best.  As a group you come 
up with a "template" sentence with a number of parts of speech left out corresponding
to the number of people playing.  Example for 5:

The ________________  _________________ _________________ the __________________ ______________
      adjective           noun             transitive               noun         adverb phrase
                                             verb


Sort of an extreme extension of Mad Libs from days of yore.

Then each person comes up with a part of speech for each blank in the sentence.  An example
might be:

new-born
jackhammer
kidnapped
gerbils
in the next town

The sentence is then read aloud with successive players filling in the appropriate word.
After the first sentence, the player to the left begins and so on until everyone has started.
Sometimes the sentences just don't work, sometimes they're hysterical.  Some past results:

The bloodthirsty bag-woman choreographed the President into a tree.
The invisible barn ate peanut butter.
The compassionate cow dissected the cat slowly.


Waiting for your meal at a particularly slow resturant or long car-trips lend themselves
very nicely to this game.

In case anyone's wondering, this grew out of a conversation on attemping to come up with a 
sentence that had never been previously spoken in the history of the language.
