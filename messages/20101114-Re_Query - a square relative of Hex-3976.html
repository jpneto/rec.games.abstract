I must conclude that your idolizing comments prior to my departure

My comments were never idolizing, just supportive and respectful. What
you did was very childish, especially the trail of spam you left
behind for me to clean up before deactivating your account. Don't make
a thread about how you're leaving my group, "especially not one so
dramatic" just get lost already. Nobody prepared a fanfare of "Pop
Goes the Weasel" for your exit. My earlier comments were about
Havannah not lame old Query. I never liked Query and I never will like
Query.
