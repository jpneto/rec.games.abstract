 &gt;&gt;You've reduced the avg number of games by almost 1 per day to compensate,

 &gt;Not talking about Tinsley's other severe hardware limitations like limited
 &gt;memory capacity and processing speed.

To my view, Tinsley still has the advantage in terms of "hardware".

His memory capacity for opening knowledge is larger and more reliable
than Chinook's.  Chinook is limited to published knowledge, which is
clearly inferior to Marion's encyclopedic memory and years of private
research.  Most of Chinook's previous losses are a direct result of
opening errors, some of which were considered "best" in the references.

Tinsley's search algorithm is more efficient, resulting in an effective
processing speed which greatly surpasses Chinook's in certain positions.
Other positions favour Chinook's abilities, so it is a contest to see
who can obtain those positions which best suit their styles, just as in
any contest between humans.  I give Tinsley an edge here.

Endurance and fatigue?  In the first Tinsley - Chinook match, the only
game that was clearly determined by physical weakness was Chinook's
forfeit in game 18 -- the turning point of the match for Tinsley, who
trailed 2-0 at the time.  Tinsley did have some trouble with the tight
schedule, but it is not clear that that contributed to either of his
losses.  With the increasing complexity of the Silicon Graphics hardware
used for these matches, it is not at all unreasonable to assume that
Chinook's risk of mechanical failure is greater than Tinsley's.

The only arena in which Chinook can claim an edge is in it's knowledge
of endgames.  Even then, Tinsley seldom loses in this phase of the game,
and has found many difficult draws in the past.  Small edge to Chinook.

In this light, the natural question is:  Which one is the machine?  :-)
