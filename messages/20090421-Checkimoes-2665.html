Checkimoes is a game for two players.

Needed components:

 - A checkerboard

 - A set of dominoes numbered 0-0 to 6-6 (i.e., a 28-piece
   "double-six" set)

The board starts empty and the dominies are mixed face-down on the
table next to the board.

One player is designated "White" and the other "Black".  Each player
secretly draws a hand of 7 dominoes.

Starting with the white player, players alternate taking turns, where
a turn consists of:

 - Placing a domino on the board, so it spans two adjacent squares
   (one black and one white), obeying restrictions described below.
   If this is not possible, skip this step.

 - Draw a domino from the face-down pool.  If none are left, skip this
   step.

Play continues until both players must skip both of the steps above.

Victory conditions:

At the end of the game, the white player adds up the numbers on the
white squares and the black player adds up the numbers on the black
squares.  The highest total wins.


The restriction on placing a domino is at follows:

Each square coved by a domino is assigned the number on the half of
the domino that covers the square.

When a new domino is played, both halves must obey the following
criteria: Either all neighbouring squares (except that covered by the
other half of the domino) are empty, or at least one of them has the
same number that the newly-filled square gets.  Neighbours are counted
in all eight directions.

Note that adding more dominoes around a square increases the numbers
allowed in that square.

Example (requires a monospaced font to read):

   A B C D E F G H
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 1| | | | | | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 2| | |5-4| | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 3| | | | | |1-6| |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 4| | | |3| | | | |
  +-+-+-+|+-+-+-+-+
 5| | | |0| | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 6| | | | | | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 7| | | | | | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 8| | | | | | | | |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

A domino that covers E2 must do so by one of the numbers 1 or 4.

A domino that covers D3 must do so by one of the numbers 3, 4 or 5.

A domino that covers E3 must do so by one of the numbers 1, 3 or 4.

A domino that covers E4 must do so by one of the numbers 0, 1 or 3.

So it is legal to play the domino 1-1 so it covers E2 and E3.  This
now makes it legal to cover D3 by a 1, so a possible next move is
playing 3-1 so it covers C3 and D3.

If a player states he can not play a domino from his hand, he must
show his hand.  If the other player can find a legal move, he can
force the player to make this.


Variants:

The first domino must be played on two of the middle four squares, and
all subsequent dominoes must touch at least one domino (in one of the
eight directions).

Instead of letting white always start, let the player that has the
domino with the highest total start -- using this domino.  Use the
highest number on the domino as a tie-breaker.  I.e, a 6-2 wins over a
5-3 or a 4-4 (all having the sum 8).

Since doubles (such as 3-3) don't affect scoring, you can take them
out of the set before starting (so you only play with 21 dominoes).


Comments are welcome.
