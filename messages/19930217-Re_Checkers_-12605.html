How good are computer checkers players? Has the game of checkers been
"solved"?

The checkers program Chinook recently played a match for the human
World Checkers Championship, narrowly losing to the champion, Dr.
Marion Tinsley.  The program is clearly in the top 5 in the world,
and an arguement can be made that only Tinsley is better.

Checkers is not solved.  There are 5*10**20 positions.  However,
there is a good chance that the game will be solved in the next
few years.

Chinook didn't lose narrowly: it was whipped pretty thoroughly.
(Though I do agree that Tinsley is the only one who can do it)

As for checkers being solved in the next few years, I doubt it.  The
game is likely to be taken beyond the human scope (Chinook II may be
able to beat even Tinsley, who is far and away the best human
checkerer), but I doubt that will result is a first-player-win algorithm
any time soon (maybe within 10 years as data storage gets better, but
not before then).

Of course, I've been wrong before...
