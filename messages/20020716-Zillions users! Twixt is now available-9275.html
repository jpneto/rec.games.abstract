If you have the software package "Zillions of Games," you can now
play Twixt in real time over the Net! The game object is NOT defined;
the computer will make legal moves, but it does not recognize a win.
This is just a virtual board for Internet play.
You need to purchase Zillions to use this. It cost me $15 to download
their demo and purchase the registration key.

ZTwixt has lots of nice bells and whistles:

* Automatic linking, with an option to add and remove links manually

* The 'pie' rule is supported.

* Three different screen image resolutions available

* diagonally 'flipped' board perspective option

* German language version. This all means two players can play over the
  Net using different languages, different screen image sizes, and
  different board perspectives!

* Handicap boards available: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 rows

* alternate size grids: 12x12, 18x18, 36x36

* a couple of strange variants tossed in

* selection screen to tie it all together

The Zillions website is at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/</a>
The Twixt link is listed under July 6.

You should also know, there is a FREE Java Twixt applet available at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.twixt.de">http://www.twixt.de</a>
You can download and run this on your machine with the Java Runtime
Environment (which is also free.) This program actually PLAYS the game,
although poorly. It also seems to have Internet connection capability.
It does NOT support the pie rule, nor is link removal allowed.
The website is in German.

If you would like to play Internet Twixt, please visit my message board
at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=twixter">http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=twixter</a>
We could hold discussions there, and challenge each other.
I recommend we use the Newton Games server as a meeting place:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://newtongames.com/home.html">http://newtongames.com/home.html</a>
It does not feature Twixt (yet), but it's useful to have a place to meet
and talk in realtime.

Thanks very much for your attention!
