Hi,

I just came across the following puzzle from Karl Sims' excellent
puzzle collection at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.genarts.com/karl/puzzles.html">http://www.genarts.com/karl/puzzles.html</a>:

Fair Cake: When two people want to share a cake fairly, one cuts,
and the other chooses. Assuming this is a fair scheme, devise a
similar scheme for 3 people and 1 cake. Nobody should get short
caked even if the other 2 cooperate.

Answer: A cuts off a piece. B has the option to reduce that piece
and take it, and then C has the same option. The remainder of the
cake is split between the other 2 people with the usual "one cuts
and the other chooses".

Alternate recursive method: Starting with approximate thirds, each
person can swap with either of the other 2 but then must give at
least a crumb back to whoever he swaps with. This cycles until
nobody wants to swap anymore.

I'm wondering whether this might suggest an optimal swap rule for
three-player games with a first (and possibly second) move
advantage? Is there currently a generally accepted swap rule for
multiplayer games?

Cameron
