Greetings:

I am interested in finding out about any sort of games that
involve the "linking" of several independent games.

I recently became aware of the GIPF gaming project.

What intrigued me about the project was the concept of "linking" the
various games within the project.

Unfortunately, as I found out more about the games, I came to realize
that the "linking" was not what I had hoped for. In the GIPF project the
two games Tamsk and Zertz, in addition to being independent games, are
more like "subroutines" to the main game Gipf. That is to say, you play
the main game...pause for a round ofr a sobordinate game...and then
return to the main game and take some action depending on the results.

What I am interested in finding out about any sort of games that involve
a linking of "equal" level games. That is to say, each game is an
independent game and then, by some alteration of rules or additional
pieces, the games can be joined into forming a larger game.

Both of these examples could be used in describing what goes on in many RPGs
and computer games.

Fitting (somewhat) your second criteria might be things like double Monopoly
or double Risk.

Using the GIPF project games as an example, what I am looking for would
be something like being able to merge Zertz into Tamsk so that the
stones and the hourglass pieces interact in some interesting way to
augment the game.

Does anyone know of any such games?


(PS: Anybody know where the names "Tamsk", "Zertz" and "Gipf" come
from???)
