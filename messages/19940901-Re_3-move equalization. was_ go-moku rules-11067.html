This is a reasonable idea, but also has some limitations.

In theory, the Placer is at some disadvantage, simply because it is harder
to establish an equal position than it is to find a preference for one side
over the other (in the same way that it is harder for the cake cutter to
make two equal halves than it is for the chooser to pick the larger one).
This imbalance is magnified in some games because the extra move for the
first player may be invariably advantageous, regardless of the position.
For Go-moku, it may be more reasonable to use two or four moves to find a
position with equal chances.

In practice, the Placer may have a significant <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>advantage<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, because she
is able to set a position which favours her style, from either side.  For
example, a very sharp, double-edged position with equal chances would
favour a tactical player over her more methodical opponent.

The claim that this equalization method reduces opening preparation is
also questionable.  The Placer will soon develop certain "pet" openings
which she understands very well from both sides, and again will enjoy a
practical advantage despite the theoretically equal position.  The more
moves allowed for the equalization, the more specialized the Placer can
become in terms of pre-game preparation.  The result is that the practical
advantage for the Placer over the Chooser may be even greater than in the
standard game.

Also note that for games which can end in a draw, equalization may
actually be undesirable.  Competitive checkers uses a three-move
randomization method to increase the sharpness of the starting position,
in order to increase the chance of a decisive result.  Since one side is
often much stronger than the other, each opening is played twice, with
each player having a chance to play the strong side and defend the weak
side.  Despite this large increase in possible starting positions, most
experts still memorize vast amounts of opening knowledge.

For chess players, I will once again point out that the number of drawn
games can be reduced simply by abolishing the illogical stalemate rule.
If the stalemated player loses the game (so, for example, King and Pawn vs
King endings are won), the implications extend into the middle-game and
opening.

The cut-and-choose idea is a very elegant method for improving the
playability of many games, but I don't think there is one best approach to
use for all games.  Instead, I would suggest that players experiment with
equalization and/or randomization methods for each particular game, until
they find a workable system.
