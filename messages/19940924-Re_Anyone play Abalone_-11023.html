Yeah, you could make a rule preventing "tag-backs" like that.

The generic term for this is a "ko-rule", from the concept in Go. Almost 
any game is improved by adding a rule which prevents a player from amking 
a move which returns the board to the position it was in at the beginning 
of the previous player's move.

A ko situation exists in go when two playes can alternate capturing and
recapture the same two pieces in infinite alternation. Note that, strictly
speaking, a ko-fight in go does change the global position, since each
player now has an extra captured piece. However, the absolute number of
captured pieces is irrelevant; only the difference in the number of pieces
matters, so a ko-fight produces no change in the overall game position.

A challenge: Is there any game which is not improved by a ko-rule?

I still think there's an easier way to keep the game moving.  Simply play 
agressivly.  If you are forcing your opponent to move, the game doesn't 
end in a stalemate, or just run out of time.  If you have to, make a move
that provokes the other player to push you, even if it isn't a move that 
will help you.  It will help you in the end, when they are actually 
moving their marbles around.  It's at least a game then.

It's only a game if both players agree to play aggressively. There are 
almost certainly good ways to fix Abalone, but trusting the players to 
play in an "interesting" manner which increases their chances of losing 
does not strike me as a useful fix.
