I've always had problems with people who shift the focus from any
information, to the messenger or the way it is conveyed. Most of the
time in my role as messenger and the one who conveyed the info in the
wrong manner, so I've encountered my share of animosity.
Nowadays I think it's very counterproductive and at best a waste of
enegy, and not worth the trouble. When people don't hear what they
say, don't read what they write, and do that ten times over, I'd much
rather walk with my dogs.
So I'd wish discussions would focus on content, wherever.
