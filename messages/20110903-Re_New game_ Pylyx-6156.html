The laws of turn order advantage ... those being? You mention them,
name them.
Of course you can't, time to change the subject ;-) .

Concerning your reference to what I take to be the symple mechanism:
it is a simple trade-off between turn order advantage and a certain
limited amount of growth, the weight of which must be considered by
both. Very simple, very elegant, very effective, and your failure to
grasp it, whether genuine or intentional, was eh ... remarkable. Had
someone else failed to understand its beauty, he would have almost
certainly been the subject of your ridicule. It's a pity you don't
grasp the concept of self mockery either, or you might have directed
it at yourself :) .
