It'd be hard to imagine something that Hutnik wouldn't personally say
yes to.

Freeling is a pathological ham.  He wrote 16 pages of commentary in
the Arimaa forum on his own vision and keen insight in tweaking
Hanniball, creating a topic five times larger than the next largest
topic.  He pounded the forum with inane Hanniball claims for weeks.

"I made a claim about being able to predict some games' behaviour,...
The idea was to put myself in a vulnarable position regarding my
claims... the game was still very much the same as the one I
perceived... I was following the rules of complete transparancy, even
if the light didn't shine favorably on my claim..."

Then, when the spotlight got off Freeling momentarily, he was quick to
remind everyone that the topic was about him, exactly as he did in the
bgg forum with Hutnik.

"Of course I'm curious what the interested viewers make of HanniBall."

Freeling wouldn't be satisfied until the readership was ripping their
hair out in clumps and begging to die.

Hutnik in a nutshell - self-serving and ridiculous.

There's no arguing with Hutnik.  He's stupid like Jeff Dahmer poured
acid into his brain.
