Mark has little reason, I feel, to be touchy about
Cyclix. It's not a contender and it doesn't have
the sprouting mechanism at it's core, but mainly
as a support mechanism for mutual capture
between pieces within the minimalistic Atlantis
environment.

Sorry, Christian.   I said I wasn't going to mope like mopey Bill Taylor and
then I ended up semi moping.  No more moping! lol

MQ itself is quite a different story in that it really
creates a new concept in the field of Chess
variants.  I hardly held that for possible.

Thanks Christian.  For many years I've wanted to have a Chess variant but I
never got one to behave properly before MQ.  I really am the hunter.  I was
surprised as anyone when a mighty monkey swaggered into my camp.

I take it that the rules are now finalized, so I'll
do another set of graphics and see whether
Ed can modify the applet.

Thanks Christian and Ed.  Monkey Queen seems to have at last converged on
its final rule set.  The only remaining thing that even could be done would
be to take the board size up to 14x14 but this creates really long lines
that are hard to visualize.  I wouldn't want to increase the board size
unless there was a major problem developing with the smaller size, and there
is not.  I'm really excited to play my first game of Monkey Queen at
MindSports, home of where the marauding monkey theme got started  :D
