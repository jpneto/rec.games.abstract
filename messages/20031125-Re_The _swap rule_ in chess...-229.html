There's already a moderate variety in openings, forcing players to be
competent in more than one.  (Or at least, it should force them to.)
The same study that showed that some players were better at playing
White or Black, also showed that players differed in how well they
played after various opening lines.  The study concluded that some
players might do better playing lines they were not as good at,
depending on who they were facing.  I.e., "I may not be as good at
this opening as I am with other lines, but my opponent really sucks
at it!"

In practice, of course, most players tend to stick to the lines they
play well, even against opponents who also play those lines well.  But
at least in theory, there's already incentive to learn to play well at
a wide variety of openings, so that you have a broader repertoire to
use against less eclectic opponents.
