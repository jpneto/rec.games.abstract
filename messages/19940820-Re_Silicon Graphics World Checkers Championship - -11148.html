If the title is meaningless to you, then why don't you resign it?

This just proved how silly the title is.  Neither of the contestants
cared about it, and yet we have all these guys jumping on the poor Chinook
team for keeping the silly title for now so that the show at the Computer
Museum can go on.  The press might not care as much about a checkers match
if there is no title involved.  [They did show up in droves when Kasparov
was slaughtering DT in exhibition back in '89, but it was Kasparov, and it
was chess, not checkers.]  If I were the organizers, I might not press
the Chinook team to assume the title, but I would have suggested that
it would be helpful for the publicity of the makeup match with Lafferty,
and all the other events for kids in the Museum...

You are being harsh on guys who are as much the victims of circumstances
as Tinsley.  The important thing is whether a rematch with Tinsley
happens or not, not the silly title.
