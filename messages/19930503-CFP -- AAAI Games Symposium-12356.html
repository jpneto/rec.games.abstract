CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

AAAI Symposium:  Raleigh NC (USA) October 22-24, 1993.

Games: Playing, Planning,and Learning
===============================================================================

 
The symposium will provide a forum for exploring current research in
artificial intelligence and cognitive science that pertains to planning and
learning in game playing. The symposium will draw together researchers from
diverse disciplines as well as practitioners engaged in developing real game-
playing systems. Relevant disciplines include AI, cognitive science, computer
science, statistics, control theory, computational learning theory, economics,
mathematics, engineering, and others.
 
Particularly welcome is research on game playing that contributes to our
understanding of intelligence or is applicable to more than one game. Topics
include, but are not limited to: assessing and increasing the generality of
game-learning systems, computational implementations of mathematical game
analysis, counterplanning, evaluation function learning, feature discovery,
learning and using abstraction in game-playing, metareasoning, methodologies
for evaluating learning and planning, methods amenable to broader AI
problems, psychological theories and models of learning and planning in
games, reasoning and planning under uncertainty, reasoning under real-time
constraints, selective search, training paradigms for game-learning systems,
tradeoffs between learning and planning in games, utility issues in speedup
learning, interplay between AI and economic game theory in exploiting
compact representations of games for learning and planning.
 
The symposium will maintain a balance between theoretical issues and
descriptions of implemented systems to promote synergy between theory and
practice. Work in areas such as tutoring and commenting, which interacts with
game playing, is also welcome.
 
Preference will be given to completed research, but work in progress will be
considered. Each submission should include a cover letter with the name,
mailing address, email address, telephone number of all authors. Fax or
electronic submissions will not be accepted. Printed material must be in at
least 10 point type with one-inch margins. Those who wish to present their
work should submit six copies of a full paper, no more than 10 pages in
length, as well as six copies of a one-page statement of their relevant
research interests and their related publications, by June 4, 1993. Those who
attend without presenting work should submit six copies of a one-page
statement of their relevant research interests and their related publications
by June 4,1993. All submissions should be addressed to:
