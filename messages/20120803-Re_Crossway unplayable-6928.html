Btw, Corey Clark is a lowlife kibitzer.  Only a total piece of shit would butt in at the end of a long game and offer advice to one of the players.  What a fucking retard.

Nobody knows what you are talking about, you're making an ass of yourself. Even if they did know you would still be making an ass of yourself because it was a fucking win in 1. I said "you've won greg" when Greg VanPatten had a win in one during a Hex Oust game. Mark unlike you I don't believe in mystical kibitzing, I rather doubt there was some sort of strategy encoded in the words "you've won greg". If anything at best it was just some encouragement. Obviously I was cheering for the right team given what a sore loser and incessant whiner you are.
