lol, You think nobody's disgusted with you, Clark?  And no, not just Michael

Who am I shitting on, Clark?  I shit on Bill Taylor because he's a poser and
an oaf, I shit on Korneliussen because he's a wiseass with zero credentials,
and I shit on you because you're a wiseass with nearly zero credentials. 
And because you've got a lip lock on Bill Taylor's asshole.  Man that shit
is nauseating.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Please<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> get some self-respect.

Taylor will continue to be shat on, no matter what - whether he's here or
not here.  I have zero tolerance for oafish posers.  Clark, I still don't
really have a beef with you.  You have a smidgen of credentials, you're a
fan of my games...

I used to shit on Gipf, but I renounced that in my efforts to become a nice
guy.  Why won't you let me be a nice guy, Corey?
