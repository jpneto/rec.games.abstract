The strategy works as follows: divide the board into two
equal-sized parts along the short diagonal.  Every time player one
places a stone in one half of the board, player two places a stone
in the other half [at a point mirrored across the dividing line].

Last week I took issue with his formulation, ending:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There may be a winning strategy for the second player on the Nx(N-1)
board, but I would be quite surprised if it's a simple one.

At that point <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk">ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk</a> (Aubrey de Grey) was kind enough to
surprise me with the news that I had misinterpreted Torben's remarks
(which are approximately correct, though somewhat vague) and provided
a proof which I present in somewhat modified form below.

Torben's idea is to divide the board in half along (almost, but not
quite) the short diagonal of the board, and match up the halves as
(slightly offset) mirror images.  For example, the 7x6 board is
matched up as in the left diagram below:

                    /
        a b c d e f/
         g h i j k F             a b c d e f
          l m n o K E             g h i j k
           p q r O J D             l m n o
            s t R N I C             p q r
             u T Q M H B             s t
             /U S P L G A             u
            /

To prove that this is a second player win, let us identify the two
halves of the board and let the first player play solitaire on the
diagram at right.  He puts down a red marker whenever he would play on
the northwest (lower case) half of the original board, and a blue
marker whenever he would play on the southeast (upper case) half.  The
second player's strategy ensures he cannot put both colors down on
the same point.

Now to see if the first player has won, we connect any two adjacent
markers of the same color, and to model connections across the mirror,
we connect pairs along the southeast (utrokf) edge whenever a red
marker has a blue neighbor to its northeast.  (No connection is made
when the blue neightbor is to the southwest, because for example
positions "o" and "R" are not adjacent in the original diagram, while
positions "r" and "O" are adjacent.)

The object is for the first player to make a path from a red marker on
the north (abcdef) edge to a blue marker on the southwest (aglpsu)
edge.  But the only place that the path can change color is on the SE
edge, and a red path from from the N edge to the SE edge blocks the
blue NE neighbor from continuing on to the SW edge.

So the first player cannot win, and the impossibility of draws implies
that the second player wins.
