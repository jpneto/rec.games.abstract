*** DISTO *** 

INTRODUCTION 

Disto is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. 

DEFINITIONS 

In these rules, "adjacent" always means "orthogonally adjacent". 

A person is a maximal set of orthogonally connected stones. 

A liberty is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to a person. 

A meal is a person with no liberties. 

A glutton is a person adjacent to a meal. 

A glutton is sick if it has exactly one liberty. 

PLAY 

Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must either pass or place a stone of their color on an empty point where it doesn't turn any enemy sick gluttons into meals.

The game ends when both players pass consecutively. A player's score is the number of stones of their color that aren't part of any meals, plus a komi in the case of White. 

KOMI 

The komi is the number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. To avoid ties, it is suggested that komi be of the form n + 0.5, where n is a whole number. 

NOTES 

Disto is an attempt at recreating some of the dynamics of Go in a game without captures. As in Go, a group surrounding a bulky five, a 3x1 territory or a 2x2 territory is dead (most of the time at least), and a group with two eyes is alive.
