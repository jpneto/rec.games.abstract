Sorry to disappoint you, Clark, but that is in fact the truth of the matter.

Where's the credit? <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://superdupergames.org/gameinfo.html?game=slash">http://superdupergames.org/gameinfo.html?game=slash</a>
Where is Nash's name on that entire page? Nowhere to be seen.
