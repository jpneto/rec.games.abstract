I'd be interested to hear what the static evaluation problems are.

Although there are well defined important features in the game it can be
hard to tell exactly how to assess these features.  In Checkers or Chess
you can simply count up the material and end up with an evaluator which is
not too shabby.  Put in a few more things about passed pawns or loose
checkers and there you go.  With Othello one uses mobility, potential
mobility and edge configurations.  However, some moves are better than
others and sometimes certain bad edge configurations end up not mattering
at all.  The history of Othello is much shorter than Chess, Go, checkers
or other such games.  So the strategy is not quite as well studied as
other games.  For example, last year's world champion used a disc extracting
strategy in the finals.  And another important feature is parity ... though
results from the program Peer Gynt seem to indicated that it may not be
important, while most strong human players are aware and use parity.

Branching factor:  I think this was hashed out a few months ago and I don't
have the messages any more.  I calculated about 7.5 or 8 by averaging
the data from a graph in Rosenbloom's AI Journal paper.

Hmm.  Sorry but that's wrong.  The average number of moves available to a
player at any stage of the game is roughly 13.  Therefore the branching
factor is about 3.46 = square root of 13.

What computer program competitions are held for Othello programs in the US?
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is a man-machine tournament held in the summer, though I don't have
details about it.  I refer you to: The U.S. Othello Association, 920 North-
gate Ave., Waynesboro, VA 22980 USA.

I don't know of any in the US, but the Waterloo Computer Othello Open is in
Canada.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, the Waterloo Tournament is quite a big event.  Last years tournament
saw what had to be the strongest computer Othello tournament ever held.
