Abstract games seem to be inflicted with a large number of Christians.  On
Game Site Y, a guy calling himself the Preacher introduces himself with "Do
you know Jesus loves you?"  I politely but curtly responded "I'm really,
really not interested in your religious beliefs."  He immediately ramps up
the rhetoric with something like "Well how about God in your life
independent of religion?"

Religion is a supreme idiocy only achievable by humans.  An animal isn't
capable of being that stupid.  Religion is the product of fear and
arrogance.  You're afraid of your own finitude.  You can't bear the thought
of you no longer existing someday.  (I can bear the thought of you no longer
existing, lol)

The arrogant solution?  Buy into a ridiculous fantasy in which you're
essentially an infinite being.  WTF??  You're a fucking primate and you're
going to rot in the ground just like Fido and Fifi in the back yard.   You
bliss yourself out and then arrogantly feel sorry for all the poor slobs who
aren't also blissed out.

So after I grill this guy for a couple of days, he admits he's just covering
the bases, just in case.  I told him to build a nuclear bunker and live
underground, just in case.  What a cowardly philosophy.  The big preacher
dumps a ten gallon drum of stale rhetoric on me and then bails out on his
own conviction.  What the fuck is that??

What drives these idiot preachers?  Insecurity.  They're plagued with their
own nagging doubts.  So if they can convert some poor slob to their
ludicrous religion, it must be true, lol

A final word on the bible.  The bible was written at a time when the earth
was widely believed to be flat.  So notions like angels standing on the four
corners of the earth made perfect sense at the time.  Now those notions
don't make sense.  So in a desperate attempt to maintain the "truth" of the
bible, its innumerable ludicrous assertions are "interpreted" by jackass
preachers who grew up on a farm in Oklahoma and don't know two plus two.
