Not to mention, Go players are the biggest zealots of any players i
have ever met.  They are completely uncompromising on any aspect of
their game, or how it is played.  They have established their own set
of ideals on how the game should be played and anyone differing from
these ideals is wrong.

You aren't familiar with the International Draughts community then, I
fear.
They don't even play topmatches anymore, but assign draws beforehand
to safe time.
Then they 'proceed' with ever shorter blitz games to determine the
winner (because blitzgames have been known, albeit on rare occasions,
to lead to a decision).

Of course the players live in denial, so the 25 suggestions in one of
the leading Dutch Draughts sites address a problem that doesn't even
exist!

Do you hear me? There's nothing wrong with the game! It's the
players! ;-)
