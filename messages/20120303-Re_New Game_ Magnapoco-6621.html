Hi Nick, I just wanted to say I appreciated you dedicating a game to
me. I was going to hold off commenting until I had a chance to play
but instead I went without internet all week. I can only think of the
typical pallid crap "Oh great Job Nick". I'll just say for now I think
its a really innovative concept, a very subtle design that seems like
it has the potential to lead to some very remarkable gameplay but to
be honest I don't feel like I can say much else, I'd have to play it
to get a real sense of it. Also I'm still waiting for that Chess
variant!! ;)

Heh :)

You know, I actually had two games for you, because "design a game Corey would like" was a personal challenge to myself for a little while. But I forgot the structure of the other game before I wrote down the rules. Lost for now.
