There is no program, as far as I know.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
If you find a program, preferably for Windows, please let me know.  Just
last week I 'discovered' this game and I think it's fabulous.  I've
already written a review of it at Funagain.com.  At this moment I'm
trying to read as much about it as I can find and playing over the few
annotated games I've found, hoping to learn as much about it as I can.

Look at the puzzles on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv</a> , and on
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.msoworld.com">http://www.msoworld.com</a> in the MindZine courses. I know David Bush who wrote
the last one was working on some twixt program, but I also am quite sure
that it is very hard to provide reasonable resistance against a human
player.

Better still, than a program, would be an online site to play against
others in real-time.  For a game that's in the GAMES Hall of Fame, I'm
somewhat surprised no site (that I know of) has implemented Twixt yet.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is not so strange, due to the lack of players in all games like this. I
think we can expect a version of TwixT online, at least in a few months'
time, on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.newtongames.com">http://www.newtongames.com</a> .
