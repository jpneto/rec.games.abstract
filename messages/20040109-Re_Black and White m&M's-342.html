OK, I'm officially off my rocker
But, today, I'm munching on some of the new B&amp;W M&amp;M's and I start thinking...
what games can you play with them?

  I've often considered, in my copious free time, "minimal" games
that you could play with only a few items.  It's hard.  I'm not even
talking about Go, because to play Go properly you need a gigantic
board with gridlines on it, and most M&amp;M munchers don't carry around
one of those.
  Here's one on the level of Tic-Tac-Toe.

  Materials: Three white M&amp;Ms and two black M&amp;Ms.  Or vice
versa.  Doesn't matter.
  Setup: Place the M&amp;Ms in a random configuration on the table,
on five of the nine squares of an imaginary 3x3 board.
  Play: One player takes White and the other, Black.  Each
player, in turn, moves one of his tokens one square horizontally
or vertically to an empty space, staying within the imaginary
square board.
  Goal: The White player wins if he surrounds the black M&amp;Ms
such that they cannot move.  The Black player wins if he
prevents the White player from doing that [within N moves, or
until the players get bored].

  Example:

  ox    x   x    xo   xo  x o  x o  x    x    x
   ox  oox  oox  o x  ox  ox   ox   oxo  oxo   xo  xxo
  x    x    x    x    x   x     x    x     x  o x  o x

....and so on.  Hey, I said it was like Tic-Tac-Toe!
  I'm fairly certain that Black can always stave off White from
this initial position, but I haven't done any analysis of the
game.

  A variant would allow either player to expand the board in
either direction when it got to be 2x3 in size (as in the fifth
board of the game above).  I.e., from that position Black could
have scooted out of White's clutches to this position:

     xo
    o x
     x

  It would also be helpful to adopt a rule that would prevent
a player from repeating the same board position twice in a row.
In that case, Black could even force a win by forcing White back
and forth in one spot!
