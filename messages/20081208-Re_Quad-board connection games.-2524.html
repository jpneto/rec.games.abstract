"The tessellation is an afterthought" is both untrue and ridiculous. If
anyone but you had suggested it you'd surely have laughed.


The rules to Hex -- as well as most of your games -- explicitly call for hex
grid, and for good reason. It is the only trivalent grid on a plane in which
each cell has an identical neighborhood and a single orientation. Adding the
FCFC rule allows for only one other -- the square grid.


You have struggled to port some games that work in one tessellation to
another within this very newsgroup, demonstrating to me that you don't think
it's an afterthought.


While it is true that the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>object<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and in some cases, the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>strategies<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of
connection games may be demonstrated with a blank sheet of paper and pen,
this is usually NOT true of the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>tactics<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. Maybe because you -- as you have
claimed yourself -- are uninterested in actual game play, only game
invention, you vastly underestimate the importance of tactics in defining a
game.
(For a connection game that works quite will with NO grid: see CALCULUS for
one example: (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/30914">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/30914</a>))


In my opinion, from a game player's perspective, tactics are the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>more<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
important feature. It is my experience and belief that a strong Hex player,
having never heard of The Game of Y or Poly-Join or Atoll or any of a large
number of hexagonally tessellated connection games, could play these games
at a high level instantly. This is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the case when moving to a
non-trivalent grid.


And although those <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>subtle<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> differences between playing hex on a standard
hexelated rhombus and on a rhombus of pentagons+heptagons squares+octagons
or other trivalent grid are not as overwhelming as when playing on a
non-trivalent grid, the greater the players' experience, the more the
pronounced those differences become. To a beginner, the difference between
FIDE Chess and Chess with the back row pieces in randomized positions is
negligable.


That Atoll is "fundamentally different from hex" because it has 8 (or more)
goals rather than 4 is an odd assertion for you to make. If it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>were<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> true,
it would seem to undercut the point you're trying to make. A generalization
is not "fundamentally different* from one of it specific cases. The
fundamental goal of hex is to connect one's goal areas. The number of goals
is no more or less a fundamental change than the way the pieces connect.


I find your analogy weak (and condescending, but that's what we expect of
you). I'll fix it. Mommy bought you a yellow Pinto. You wanted a red one. Do
you have a red one? No, you don't. Is it a different class of automobiles?
-- no, of course it isn't -- that's the whole point! It's the SAME class of
automobile. "Yellow Pinto" and "Red Pinto" are specific examples of the more
general case "Pinto". They are also specific examples of "cars",
"transportation", "things with wheels" and "non-ducks", all of which are
different general cases. "Yellow things" includes only one of these. Can you
tell which?


Which is more "fundamentally different" from the [2-door] Lamboghini daddy
got me -- a 4 door BMW 535 or a 2 motor home? Only someone who has never
seen a car and has no idea what they do might decide on topological
reasoning that the BMW is the odd one -- but everyone else on earth would
make the more reasonable judgment. Oh -- I suppose the inventor of the door
might see it differently. Is that the problem? Do you think you invented the
door?


Get a clue Mr. Steere.

Other than avoiding spam, YOU are one of the reasons I prefer posting
without my name. I don't want someone to google me years from now and find
your rantings. Nearly all of the condescending, insulting and profane posts
in this group come from you. You seem to think that ad-hominem attacks
somehow support your arguments.
