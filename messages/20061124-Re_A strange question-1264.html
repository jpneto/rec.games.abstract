Thanks again, everybody, for the comments so far.  A few responses
below:

My first thought was to relax the randomiser-free criteria and go for

all three around in one box.

Good point.  But actually all I really want to do is carry all three
around on my Palm and practice enough to get better at them--and be
able to read about them, because there's probably a good deal I won't
learn via trial and error.

your later suggestion of nine men's morris is the obvious choice.  It's
historical too.  . . .

I think I've decided on NMM at this point.  The main reason, really, is
that I like it better than the other games (well, except maybe
backgammon).  But I also like the fact that NMM, like chess and
checkers, dates back to antiquity:  though the modern versions of each
game may be traceable to a particular time and place, their roots
extend back into the unknown past.  Another piece of my rationale:  NMM
is related to tic-tac-toe (noughts &amp; crosses), which means all three of
these games were at least somewhat familiar to me when I was a child.
So they're linked to my own past as well as the world's past.

I'd still consider tablut/hnefatafl as an alternative, though you'd have
to be careful which variant you choose, as some work better than others.
One of the Icelandic sagas - I can't remember which at the moment -
mentions a gaming board which was for chess and hnefatafl, so they were
associated.

I have Zillions of Games, so I'll probably experiment more with the
tafl games.  They certainly do have a good look and feel to them.

The problem I have with Zillions is that it plays some games too well.
Even if I set the difficulty slider to "Pushover," I can't win a game
of chess.  It's the same with some other games.  So far I don't think
I've ever won a game of tablut or hnefatafl, and it gets pretty
discouraging.

That brings me to one of the main reasons I'm focusing on these three
games in the first place.  I'm lousy at thinking ahead logically, and I
want to make myself practice it.  I have a lifelong bad habit of making
impulsive moves in games like these, then keeping my fingers crossed
and hoping my opponent is even more shortsighted than I am.  That works
against fellow novices and really dumb computer programs, but I don't
want to be stuck there all my life.  (And I've probably only got two or
three more decades to correct the problem.)

Thanks again.
