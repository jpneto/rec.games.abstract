**If you think that Monopoly is all there is to board games you
are wrong**

I've played X (substitute any well known game - Monopoly,
Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble, Ludo, Cluedo ....) and I don't like
board games!
----------------
Not all board games are made the same.  Unfortunately most
popular games tend to go something like this:
*roll dice
*move around a board
*land on a space
*perform some action
*repeat for 3-4 hours

We are a Board Gaming Group based in Northern Ireland.

What do we play?
----------------
We play a wide variety of International and European board &amp;
card games.  Most are either published in the US or in Germany
(where there is a large and well established board games
industry).  There are a number of US/European companies
publishing the German games in English, so no knowledge of
German is required to play them.

The games we play usually:
*play in around an hour to one hour and a half
*may not use any dice
*keep all players in the game, and in the running, until the end
*are decided by merit rather than luck

They also have some interesting mechanisms such as:
*boards that are randomly arranged before play
*bargaining/bidding/trading elements
*more than one path to victory

These are not wargames owning in part to Germany's post-World
War II stigma against militarism in popular culture.  The themes
vary widely, as a visit to our website should prove.

Anyway, if you live in the Greater Belfast/Newtownabbey area (or
further away and don't mind travelling) and are a boardgamer, or
intrigued enough to give it a try, Board Gamers Anonymous would
love to hear from you.  We meet in the Valley Leisure Centre,
Newtownabbey every fortnight from 10 am - 4 pm or so.

New members will receive a friendly welcome.

If you're interested send me an email or visit our website
(address in sig) for more details.

More information/discussion of these games can be found on the
rec.games.board newsgroup.

Ivan.
