Actually, there is even an easier way for the first player to lose, if
that is what he wants to do.
Just connect two vertices on your first move such that the line does
not intersect any intermediate vertices. Connecting two adjacent
vertices will do. You'll lose before the second player even moves.

As far as losing by playing the symmetric moves after first bisecting
the grid with a line, I don't think that will necessarily work either.
Remember that no lines can be drawn from any vertices that already
have lines terminating there. So, reflective symmetry about the first
(main diagonal) line won't work if the second player draws lines from
that first line. Rotational symmetry won't work if there are an odd
number of dots, and the second player draws from the center dot, which
is on the first line.

Still, the goal is to WIN, not to lose.  :)


Thanks,

Sorry if this is unoriginal.

Here is a game for two players. It is played on an n-by-n grid drawn
(practically perfectly) on paper. I suggest that n be at least 8.

Note: (The lines of the grid do not come into play here. Only the
"grid-vertices" {where the lines of THE GRID intersect} are important
as far as the grid is concerned.)
By "lines" below, I am referring to straight line-segments drawn by
players during play.

The first player to move draws a line from any grid-vertex to any
other grid-vertex.

The players thereafter take turns drawing lines, one line per move,
such that:
* each line starts at a grid-vertex intersected by any previously
drawn line (drawn by either player).
* each line ends at any grid-vertex not yet touched by a line.
* no line crosses another line or coincides with another line.
* no line starts/ends at or crosses another line's end-point (whether
or not yet another line passes completely through that vertex).

If you can move, you must. (The other player can help you find
allowable moves.)

The LAST player to be able to move LOSES.

There must be an easy strategy to always win. Anyone know of one?

Thanks,

Hi, Leroy:

Thanks for posting this interesting puzzle.

It's something you may have already considered,
but there's an easy strategy to always lose as
first player, and perhaps it can be adapted to
a strategy for winning.

As first player to lose, one draws a diagonal
line from one corner of the grid to another,
so thereafter any moves must take place solely
on one side or the other of this diagonal, and
the first player can adopt a mirror strategy:
whatever move the second player makes, first
player makes on the opposite diagonal side.
Thus the first player moves last and loses!

Can this be adapted to a winning strategy?
I'm not sure if it can, or that adapting it
can be considered "easy".  A move requires
an end-point that has not previously been
touched by a line, and these are fairly easy
to keep track of.  However, although each
move eliminates one such end-point from
future consideration, grid points may also
be "dead" despite being untouched because
they became isolated by surrounding line
segments from all possible start-points.

regards, chip
