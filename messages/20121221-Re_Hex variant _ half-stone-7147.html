Here is an idea.

Couple of problems.  The cell which is orange on the left and blue on the right.  Copy that to each of the two cells adjacent upper left and adjacent upper right (so that there's a cluster of three filled cells).  Now you have a blue connection crossing an orange connection.  Do they both connect or do neither connect?  If neither connect you can have a non-conclusive outcome with neither player connecting.  If they both connect, you don't have the interesting geometric property of Hex that a board filled with any permutation of stones has exactly one winner.  

Also, all the cells you've filled are divided left-right.  If that's a rule, that creates an asymmetric, unequal game for Blue and Orange.  If the cells can be divided in any of the three orientations, it's symmetric, but you still have the connectivity problem of the preceding paragraph.
