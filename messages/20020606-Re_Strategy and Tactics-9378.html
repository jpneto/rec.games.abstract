Since the computer player in question had never been observed before in
public, one couldn't possibly extrapolate anything from previous
instances of its play, since there weren't any.

Again, this completely foolish analysis (assuming that because other
computer programs had not succeeded in achieving X, this more powerful
computer program wouldn't be able to do X either, even though it's known
to be more powerful than the previous programs that failed to do X) is
precisely the psychological mistake that Kasparov later made, at a very
high cost to him.  Kasparov clearly believed that there were certain
"kinds" of moves that computers could find, and other kinds of moves
that computer players would be unable to find, by their nature.  And
this was clearly demonstrated to be very wrong.  Of course, the computer
scientists observing the matches already knew that---but it was
demonstrating it to the public that was necessary, as your comments
show.  Your comments also demonstrate that some members of the public,
like Kasparov, didn't necessarily get it, even after it was
demonstrated.
