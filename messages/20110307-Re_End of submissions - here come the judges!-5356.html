May I also remind you that I supported the contest by posting its
progress at LG and Arimaa and MindSports, while you were mainly
glorifying Monkey Queen.

Most if not all contestants mailed their entries to me, remember. And
I agreed to most any terms suggested by most everyone. You only got
objections and disclaimers rolling left and right and there seems to
be no end to it. Inexplicably you next accuse me of considering this
contest of some major importance.
The simple fact is I'm willing to throw a game to the wolves and let
them have their way with it - any pack of wolves, laymen or expert,
closed or public. I don't care. But you care a lot, because someone
might find fault with a game you consider perfect, like any Mark
Steere game.
If that weren't boring too, I'd say 'gow up'.
