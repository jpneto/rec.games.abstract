    I'm looking for a copy of Winning Ways by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy.  
  I'm willing to spend up to $60 (maybe more, but less would be nice).  If 
  you know where I can get these books, please let me know.

The two volumes are from Academic Press Inc. and the ISBN of the first
volume (I don't have the other one on me right now) is 0-12-091101-9.
That should be enough info that you can have your local bookstore order
it for you.  If they are out of print I will be extremely surprised,
since they are the premier works on game theory of this type.

Well, a few months ago when I tried to order them, they certainly were
still available!  But for MUCH more than $60, even for the softcover.

I suspect the original poster is looking for a used version for
monetary reasons.  Me, I found a library which has it.  This was the
first time a book I wanted was too expensive to buy, a frustrating
experience.

By the way, the ISBN of volume 2 is 0-12-091102-7.  And, it's urk,
horribly overdue at the library :-(

If anyone is willing to part with a copy for anything in the ballpark
of $60 or so, I'd also be interested.
