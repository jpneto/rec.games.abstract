I think the trouble you're having evaluating Symple's move order advantage,
Christian, is that you're envisioning its gameplay as a continuum.  It
isn't.  An abstract game is a discrete series of state changing events.

I remember a dopey Icehouse game from a few years back.  Players just grab
at the pieces and rearrange them whenever they feel like it, without taking
turns.

Your statements, "So both players have their finger on the switch," and
"<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Both<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> players can decide to end black's prerogative at any point" are
misleading.  They're more reflective of Dopey Icehouse than an abstract game
such as Symple.  In Symple you can't change the state of the game "at any
point".  You can only do so on your turn.

Secondly, there isn't just one switch, as your statements seem to imply. 
There are two switches, one for Player 1 in which he grows his groups, and a
second, DIFFERENT TYPE of switch for Player 2 in which he grows his groups
AND adds a stone.

FACT: Symple, a finite-decisive game, is by definition either a win for
Player 1 or Player 2.

FACT: For the losing player in perfect Symple play (for a given board size),
"Player L", there is NEVER an advantageous opportunity to pull the trigger.
It'll always be either too early or too late - never just the right time.

COROLLARY: For Player L in NEARLY perfect Symple play, there will RARELY be
an advantageous opportunity to pull the trigger.

Two factors which affect move order advantage in scalable games are board
size and skill level.  Expert play can equal perfect play or nearly perfect
play if the board is made small enough.

Conversely, for a given board size, the more expert players become, the more
nearly perfect their play will be, and the less likely that Player L will
have an advantageous opportunity to pull the trigger.  Therefore, contrary
to Christian Freeling's claim that Symple "converges to 50/50 in the long
run", Symple (just like all other abstract games) DIVERGES from 50/50 in the
long run.

Christian Freeling explains:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

...making the mechanism a "trajectory pie" that
can only converge to this balance point.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, you're describing a continuum, Christian.  The only "points" in an
abstract game are turns, AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A BALANCED TURN!!  The
closest you'll ever get to a balanced turn in an abstract game is the first
turn in Hex with the pie rule.  Strike that.  The closest you'll ever get is
the first turn in FRACTAL with the pie rule.

Science is real, Christian.   It isn't a game of outlandish claims and
semantic tomfoolery.
