   Since all players are competent, they will all use this strategy! hence the
   probability of victory would be 1/N, regardless of which number <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play.

   the probability "1" is the winning play = probability no one else plays "1":
   1/N = (1-P1)^(N-1)       hence we can solve for P1.

I'm afraid I don't follow how you reached this equation.  You seem to
have started in the case of "if X follows this general strategy, then
X will win 1 out of N games on average" and added the condition "X
plays 1" and concluded that "X wins 1 out of N games on average when
playing 1."  1/N is the global probability, true, but it's useless in
finding the local probabilities.  Please explain.
  
   the probability "2" is the winning play = probability no one else plays "2" and
   at least 2 players played "1": (if both "1" and "2" win, we will assign the
   probability to "1")
   1/N = P1^2 * (1-P2)^(N-3)       hence we can solve for P2.

nitpick: all else being equal, this should be 
1/N = (P1^2 + (1-P2-P1)^2) * (1-P2-P1)^(N-3).
