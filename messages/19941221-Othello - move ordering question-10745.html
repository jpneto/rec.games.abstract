I've been poking around with optimal play on reduced Othello boards, and
trying to make my tree search efficient enough to get up to interesting
sizes.  After incorporating alpha-beta and large transposition tables,
it's usual to add the killer heuristic (which I haven't done yet) and
then try to get as close to perfect ordering on the move generations as
possible, to let alpha-beta do its thing with maximal efficiency.

I thought before I went into the tricky stuff like reducing the opponent's
mobility or trying for known good patterns, I'd try something dead simple:
if there's a corner move, take it; otherwise try all the moves in
numerical order (like a TV scan across the board).

Oddly, this degraded the tree-searching performance dramatically from
just leaving the moves in numerical order, although it of course ends up
with the same result.

Could a human Othello player comment on this?  I thought perhaps retaining
the threat of moving into a corner might be more effective than grabbing
it immediately; does this correspond to a known human strategy?
