I've recently bought a game with the prosaic name, 'Link Up Game'. It's made
in China and intended for a Western market (CE marks and all). The
construction is fairly clever - a plastic board with 8 x 8 little pits into
which fit ball-like pieces that can be rotated to show one of four colours.
Unfortunately one has to assemble each piece individually, which is a little
tedious.
The start position is 4 pieces, each a different colour, in the centre of
the board. Play is like Othello/Reversi, and you can flip all other colours
between two of your pieces. The winner is the player with the most pieces of
his colour when all the spaces are filled.
As the rules on the back of the box go, the game is flawed. After the first
move, one other player is automatically cast out of the game and after the
second move, it's possible to have only two players remaining.

Has anyone ever tried this game and is there a way to tweak the rules to
make it playable?
A possible rule might be that any player without a piece of his colour on
the board at his turn could flip any other piece to his colour, or
alternatively place a piece of his colour adjacent to any other piece
without flipping.
Any information would be useful.
Regards,
Keng Ho
