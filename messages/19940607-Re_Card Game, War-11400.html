Using the rules I learned, war is a game with no strategy possible because
you don't have any choices to make. It's like playing Candyland or Snakes and
Ladders.

The rules are:
Shuffle a normal card deck and divide it equally among all of the players.
Each player shuffles their pack. On each round every player plays the card
from the top of their pack face up. The player who played the highest card,
collects all of the cards played that round. If there is a tie all of the tied
players play a card face down and another card face up. Whoever played the
the highest face up card amoung the tied players gets all of the cards for
the round. If there was still a tie the same procedure is used until one
player wins. When you run out of cards you are out of the game. When you reach
the end of your deck you having been playing cards off of, you shuffle all
of the cards you have collected since the last time you shuffled, shuffle
them and start playing off the top of that pack.
