I have a number of abstract games (a few rare) available for sale.
The prices on these are negotiable, to an extent (especially if you want more
than one item).  If several people request the same item at once, I
reserve the right to run a quick auction for that item.  I have a list of
items I may be willing to accept in trade at the bottom of the post.

Now that PayPal is charging fees for any reasonable account, I would
prefer to receive payment by check or money order.  However, PayPal is
acceptable, especially if you are buying a lot and/or don't live in the
US.  I will ship anywhere, by the way, although note that shipping costs are
not included in the prices.


Carapace
--------
Older (1970) item from Plan B, a fairly obscure company which published
some interesting games.  This is an unequal forces movement and capture game 
in which it is predetermined which side is going to win - players take turns 
playing each side to see who does the best.  Box somewhat scuffed but
intact, contents in very good shape.
$15


Crosse
------
One of a series of games originally published by a company called DMR
(at least, I know some of them were actually released by DMR) and
republished by TSR in nice plastic boxes meant to fit on a bookshelf.
This game is something like checkers in reverse (you are trying to 
get rid of all your pieces).
$5


Forum Romanum
-------------
A (very good) lightly-themed game from Wolfgang Kramer for 2-6 players.  
This is an Edition Perlhuhn copy (in the burgundy box with the feather,
and with a roll-up board instead of the folding board from the later
edition).  This is presumably from the very first printing, as it
has pink pieces instead of black, and does not have a SdJ sticker on
the front.  It has a somewhat scuffed box, but the insides are
mint - all pieces are still sealed.  This edition includes English 
(and French) rules (the historical commentary is translated as well).
$60 or best offer


Ghosts!
-------
Classic Alex Randolph bluffing game.  Milton Bradley edition.  Box
somewhat scuffed, pieces in good shape, rules rather worn but usable.
Has 1 extra ghost.
$8


Guerilla
--------
Older (1976) game from Ariel (Philmar).  A movement and capture
game on a triangular grid.  I believe David Parlett praised it
in his Oxford History of Board Games.  The contents are in excellent
shape, with the pieces still sealed, but the box has been crunched
at one corner - it's still intact but looks a bit ugly.
$20


Isi
---
Limited edition 2-player game from Cwali - #68 of 200 copies.  A 4-player
version (Morisi) was released at last year's Essen, but a number of people
like Isi better.  In excellent condition, never played.  English rules
included.
$?? (make me an offer)


Kage
----
Another DMR game published by TSR in a nice plastic box.  Kage
involves trying to trap the opponent's piece by placing walls between
the squares on the board.  In excellent condition, pieces still sealed.
$5


Kensington
----------
You all know this one - UK game from 1979, in a record-album style
package.  In nice shape, still has the plastic cover for the album.
$7


King's Court
------------
 From Golden, a game of "supercheckers."  Play is something like checkers
on an enlarged board with a special central section - the object is 
to remove all opposing pieces from the central area.  The board
and pieces (marbleized plastic) are very attractive.  The box has a little
water damage.  The board has a little wear along the fold, but the
pieces are still sealed.
$15 (went for $52 on eBay recently, but that's an aberration - I think :))


Lemma
-----
Very unusual placement game in which players add a new rule every turn
(kind of like Nomic on a board).  Can be played by up to 6 people.
Since it's from Kadon, it also includes a large number of puzzles
(plus rules for some traditional games that can be played with the
equipment).  For a picture, see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstract.htm#LM">http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstract.htm#LM</a> -
the copy I have is identical to this so far as I can tell, except I
believe the pieces are wood instead of lucite.  The game is in excellent
shape and has never been used (the pieces are still sealed).  Costs $39
new, I'll sell this one for
$25


Leverage
--------
Good Chinese Checkers-like game with a tilting board and pieces of
varying weights.  This was published by Milton Bradley, but this is
the original edition from Star Game Co.  The contents are in good
condition, the box has some tape damage on the bottom, a split corner,
and a price written on the cover.  
$10


Pente
-----
I have two copies of this - one in the black tube, the other from
Parker in a flat box.  The tube copy is in decent shape, with some
wear on the stone bags (the lettering is flaking off) and the tube.
The boxed copy is in good shape but is missing one of the (ziplock)
stone bags.  The box has some warping and a stain on the cover.
$20 - tube
$10 - box


Quarto!
-------
Very good four-in-a-row placement game.  This is the full-size
wood edition.  Box has some scuffing (shelfwear), contents in
excellent condition.
$25


Rubik's Magic Strategy Game
---------------------------
A rather good little game originally released as Heads &amp; Tails
(I think) by Seven Towns in the UK.  This version has designs from
the Rubik's Magic puzzle but doesn't have anything else to do with
it.  It was re-released more recently as Rubik's Eclipse.  Contents
in very good condition, box has some scuffing and the odd bit of
tape and sticker residue.
$7


Steppe
------
Yet another DMR game published by TSR (in another nice plastic box).
This is a placement game with stacking tiles in various sizes.  In
excellent condition.
$5


Take The Brain (aka Smess: The Ninny's Chess)
---------------------------------------------
This is the UK version of Smess, published by Parker Brothers.  Aside from
the title it's identical to the US version, with the same goofy 
plastic pieces and day-glo board.  It's actually quite a good little
movement and capture game.  It was re-released as All The King's Men,
but this version has more retro charm. :)  The board is in decent shape,
with some wear, the pieces are in very good condition, and the box
is somewhat battered, with several split corners, but is still usable.
$25 (going for $30-50 on eBay)


Terrace
-------
"As featured on Star Trek: The Next Generation."  This version
is 8x8 with white, black, blue, and red pieces (I've seen editions
with varying board sizes, colors, and number of colors).  Box in
good shape, contents in excellent shape.
$15


Tishai
------
Cheapass Games chess variant - just a cardboard board in an envelope.
$2


Traverse
--------
Move and capture game for 2-4 players, from Educational Insights.
Won a Mensa Select award for whatever it's worth.  Box lightly
scuffed, contents unused.
$5


Vis-a-Vis
---------
Old Selchow &amp; Righter edition of Eric Solomon game currently published
as Hyle by Franjos (and previously known as Entropy, I believe)
$5
