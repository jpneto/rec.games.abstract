Here is an unoriginal game for 2 players.

You need a blank piece of paper and a pen/pencil, maybe 2 pens/pencils
of different colors.

To start, someone draw a dot in the middle of the piece of paper. Then
each player draws a different dot on the paper. (So, you have 3 dots.)


Thereafter, the players take turns forming a line of connected
straight line-segments on the paper, plus drawing dots. On their turn,
a player draws a straight line segment from THEIR END (of their color,
if the players are using differently colored pens/pencils) of the
connected string of line-segments (or from the central dot if this is
the player's first time drawing a line-segment during the game) to any
undrawn-to dot (a dot without a line-segment connected to it), such
that the line-segment doesn't pass through any other line-segments or
through any other dots along the way.

Then, on the same move, the player draws 2 dots, neither on a line or
on another dot. One dot is "visible" by the player's own end of the
line of connected line-segments. The other dot is visible by the other
player's end of the line of connected line-segments.

By 2 points being "visible" to each other, it is meant that it is
possible to draw a straight line-segment between the two points, and
that line-segment doesn't pass through any intervening dots or lines.

After a fixed number of moves, the same number of moves for both
players, the game is over.

The winner has the most number of undrawn-to dots visible from their
end-point of the line of connected line-segments.

Note: If playing with 2 differently colored pens/pencils, it doesn't
matter what color the dots are. The only reason for using 2 different
colors is to make it easier to see whose end of the line of connected
line-segments is whose.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
