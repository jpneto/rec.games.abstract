To follow the language above - if the scoring system rewards draws with
black more than white, with 0.6 and 0.4 of a point respectively, will 
that
factor disrupt 2 things? (a) if players collude to draw they do not get 
the
same reward , and (b) will it produce less draws overall by stimulating 
the
white player to fight on, and not draw?

What can be done is possibly causing the reigning champion to lose his
title, and it remains unseated, if no one manages to pull through and
actually end in a tie.

Another possibility is to use speed chess as "Overtime", like the did
recently with Chess960 as a way to tie-break.  Don't like to go there,
well then win?

Beyond this, besides a system gamed to draw, the amount of play in
chess has resulted in there being far less ways to surprise anyone, so
the end game ends up being predictable, minus a bungle.

Hi Richard, let me make a note here, since I am also a chess teacher. What 
you say is true at the top levels, but for 99% of players does not seem to 
be true in my experience or student's experience.

Theoretically some players know very much about main lines, but a 'b' class 
move puts them outside of their book knowledge, and they have to resolve 
what to do over the board. The only surprise to me is if they can do that 
without their position collapsing almost instantly :)

Even relatively strong players do not understand common opening systems - 
and even in correspondance chess I defeated a 2100 player with white and 
black in under 20 moves last year.

 Each side
will play hard, but sound, making for a reduction in pieces to the
place where a draw is left, with current rules.

You could also simply have people not be able to ask their opponent
for a draw, and force them to play it out.  Maybe do an opposite
version where you can ask your opponent to resign or force them to
double the points the match is worth.

Since I hardly ever draw I don't have an issue with my opponents level of 
play. Last week I <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> offer a draw to a 2340 player, who accepted it, I 
gained one point and he lost one. I had a slightly better position with 
white after a Ruy, but OTOH, this was a team match game, and I need to score 
better than 50% result for the team - and with black I am still a pawn up at 
move 20 after a Wing Gambit, have undoubled my b pawns and will try to win 
it.

The last option is to add new rules to chess, to make the game new.
Of course, this is heresy to hardcore players of the game, who think
the FIDE rules were handed down by God and immutable for eternity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Laugh. Unfortunately you are writing to someone who wants to play exactly 
the same game as Capablanca, Lasker, Alekhine, Fischer and Kasparov - so 
doesn't want new rules that would change the method of play.

---

What I don't understand about much of this correspondance about draws is if 
people who suggest its a problem are just speaking as chess spectators about 
top players [nothing wrong with that, and I share that point of view] or if 
they are speaking about all chess players?

I think if its just the first, and unfought 'GM-draws', then its not 
necessary to make changes for the rest of us - who after all - don't have a 
problem.

Cordially, Phil Innes
