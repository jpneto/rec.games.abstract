Hi everyone,

I have to consider the following game:
all rules are the same like in classic 'nim' game except one rule -
the
number of stones in heaps are nondecreasing (e.g. (1,2,2,6,7), not
(5,1,7)). After every move this rule must be keep. So player can
remove stones from heap X only and only if in heap to the left are
less piles and he can't remove more stones, than difference between
heap X and heap to the left. For example:

1 3 5 6

player can make 6 moves:
 - take 1 stone from 1. heap (after move - (3,5,6))
 - take 1 stone from 2. heap (1,2,5,6)
 - take 2 stones from 2. heap (1,1,5,6)
 - take 1 stones from 3. heap (1,3,4,6)
 - take 2 stones from 3. heap (1,3,3,6)
 - take 1 stone from 4. heap (1,3,5,5)

What is the winning strategy in this game? I know about winning
strategy in the classic 'nim' game. I would be gratful for
help.

PS Sorry for my English ;&gt;
