<br>
<br>And why is that? IIRC, there is a (possible?) rule in Reversi
<br>that says that a player can put down a disc without flipping
<br>anything if there are no legal ordinary moves. This is a quite
<br>unpleasant rule for the player who is ahead, who has to keep
<br>opening up moves instead of clinching a quick wipeout.
<br>
<br>As for the first 4 moves in Reversi, either player can force
<br>a parallel position, while the diagonal position in Othello
<br>can only occur if both play for it. Is there something about
<br>the parallel position that you like?
<br>
<br>Other differences that I missed?
