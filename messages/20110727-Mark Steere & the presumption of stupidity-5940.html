There are two things, Mark Steere, that you cannot bear: cycles and
stupidity. Cycles make you feel like you're "dying inside" and
perceived stupidity is pulverized by your incinerating optic blasts. A
real Cyclops! No kidding!

But every blessing holds a curse, especially for mutants, and in your
case it's being right all the time. Because being wrong, in your
incinerating view, is stupid and being stupid is lethal: you
accidentally might look in a mirror and ... poof!
You simply can't afford it.

You often say things like "to put it in a crude, generic and non-
scientific way" to give the impression that you could give refined,
specific and scientific arguments, but want to spare us the
embarresment of not understanding.
For mere humans, you act under the presumption of stupidity, mainly by
presenting common knowledge as your big personal insights, and
insinuating that the human concerned isn't aware of any of that. Your
shreds of knowledge of game theory are "science" and you use "logic"
as a measure of agreement with your own views.

Take your latest reaction to Monkey Queen. I criticized a rule with an
admittedly invalid argument, as Michael pointed out:

Michael:
"You didn't question Monkey Queen's overall quality as game, you
didn't use the rules to argue that it lacks depth or clarity or drama.
Criticizing a game as an entity is obviously fair game.
You picked one rule and used it to argue, out of context, against
finitude. It is the fact that you argue out of context with a specific
ax to grind that makes it an invalid argument."

Mark:
"Zing! I love it. Pure logic. I'm good, but not that good. It's all
yours, Christian."

What have considered opinions as given here, regardless of their
content, to do with logic? His giving a supportive view appears
necessary and sufficient for you to qualify something as 'logic'.
Some logic!

As to the content, Michael was partly right: the checkmate example was
wrong. But I'm not arguing out of context regarding forced finitude.
That, Michael, is not a 'fact'. And I certainly have no axe to grind.

How twisted the discussion has become, can be seen by Mark's reaction
about the two 'never to be born' babies. I mentioned that twice in the
thread and never before.

Mark:
"I don't enjoy endlessly discussing my own games, Christian. For me
there's a tapering off. But since you've asked this question about
thirty fucking times, here's your answer: If you broke down your final
two-stack in Monkey Queen, you'd kill your own queen, Dumbo!"

First of all, you enjoy endlessly discussing your own games above
all.
And 'thirty fucking' is actually two.
You probably heard the question thirty times in your own head.

Now let's see how logical your explanation is. Let's start with asking
whether the Queen is
1. a piece giving birth to babies or
2. a piece consisting of babies.

Let's call 1. the 'chess representation' and 2. the 'dipole
representation'.

Your own rulesheet shows the dipole representation with two stacks of
twenty checkers
and already in the second sentence (!) we read:

"For convenience, some of the checkers can be kept off the board
initially, and added to the
stacks during play as needed. If you only have 12 checkers of each
color, you can start with
them and augment the stacks with eight captured checkers each during
play."

I beg your pardon?
You can drop pieces as long as the Queen is recognizable as such, so
till it's down to two. But then you might as well start with two and
keep the others beside the board, entering one whenever the Queen
makes a non-capturing move. And since the two stacked pieces do
nothing else than representing the Queen anyway, you might as well
replace the by a chess Queen.

Then you're in the 'chess representation'. You wouldn't need a rule
like:
To win you must either:
1. Kill the enemy queen or
2. Deprive your opponent of legal moves by leaving him with a queen of
height two, no babies,
and nothing within line of sight for said queen to kill.

Talk of an aesthetic Hiroshima.
So, obvious to everyone but you, I referred to the chess
representation when I asked the question. Your answer only shows your
presumption of stupidity.

Also, it was a rethorical question. Monkey Queen had to pass for a
stacking game because you had nothing else for the contest. To get
that far you had to declare even Checkers to be a stacking game, just
to stretch the general definition (or rather absence thereof).
Of course checkers isn't a stacking game, the participants just wanted
to keep the peace.
The column checkers family, the Focus family, Pilare and Jump Sturdy,
to name a few, those are stacking games. The two checkers that make a
king are just a practical representation of one piece, not two stacked
men. The same for the Queen in MQ.

Most Checkers applets display the king as a crowned piece, not a
stack, and all Monkey Queen applets display a Queen with the number of
babies she carries, not a stack! That's what makes it weird if she
can't use the last two. A clear case of stubbornness marring a game.

But of course you couldn't ever change it. That would imply MQ isn't a
stacking game and it would make you look stupid in a mirror,
triggering an incinerating optic blast and ... poof!

That's one criticism. The second is the anti-cycle rule and I don't
think I'm out of context there. The rule is effective if you insist on
hard finitude, sure enough. But I feel that introducing an extra rule
that restricts the natural behaviour of the babies is to big a price
to pay in a game that doesn't seem particularly draw- or cycle-prone
to begin with.
Mutual extermination till both are down to a lone Queen doesn't seem
likely, and I've yet to see a
'draw by cycle'.

So in my opinion it's killing a mosquito with a bazooka.
(That better Michael?)
