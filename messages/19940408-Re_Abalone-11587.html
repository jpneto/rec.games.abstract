I have played abalone a couple of times but only with other novices. To us
it seemed to be centered completely around trying to be as passive as 
possible, and just wait for your opponent to make a mistake. Does anyone
out there have any good strategies for more agressive play?

I'm also novice level, but what worked well a couple of times was trying
to separate the opponent into two pieces, then work on the smaller one
while going defensive against the larger... rather like Napoleon at Quatre
Bras assigning d'Erlon's corps to hold back Wellington while using the
rest to give the Prussians a drubbing.  On the other hand, the most recent
time I tried it, my wife thrashed me soundly.

I think it's weighted in favor of defense.  Definitely a game to play with
a chess clock.
