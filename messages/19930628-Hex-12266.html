Hello:

	I was recently introduced to a simple game called Hex, to wit:

	- The board is composed of thirteen rows of thirteen hexagons,
	  forming a parallelogram.

	- There are two players, 'X' and 'O.'  Each player 'owns' two
	  opposite edges of the parallelogram.

	- The two players take turns placing their marks in the hexes.  
	  The only 'special' thing here is that the first player may not 
	  mark the center hex (i.e. the seventh hex in the seventh row)

	- The first player to form a connected line of hexes, no matter
	  how squiggly, from one of his edges to the other, wins the 
	  game.

	That is all there is.  I am interested in teaching my computer
to play this game.  I was wondering what sort of thoughts people had on
algorithms/strategies for this game.  I have not been able to play very 
effectively yet, but I am working on it 8^).  

Thanks,

	Hank Alme
