My idea was that either player starts with Black, and they alternate for those 4 moves (2 moves each), then Black chooses to play move 5, or swap colours because even with the initiative to Black, he prefers White.

This doesn't work. Black will simply play optimally from start and play move 5 as Black to retain his advantage.

Giving White the option to pass a number of times, as a komi of sorts, seems like the best way to balance the game, although a bit too coarse-grained, since the optimal komi would be very low.

Quite right, what a boneheaded suggestion of mine. Yes, it would have to be after 3 or 5 moves - 5 would be interesting I think, as it's likely to constitute the first approach move, which makes strategic understanding particularly important.

I think the komi / pass idea is a good one, but I suspect it will be quite hard to balance without a considerable number of games to draw upon. Bill seems to think 3 is about right, but I'm unconvinced - not that I have good reason to think otherwise, but it just feels too arbitrary to me. It could be 1, it could be 6, it could be anywhere inbetween. I'm suspecting it's smaller rather than larger though :)
