Could you at least place a summary of anything you get back here? It's
not that I'm a big board game nut, but I keep hearing about this game as
one of the four archetypal categories of board game - and I wish I could
quote the other three off hand; I think they may be "chase" (as in
backgammon or the Royal Game of Ur), "battle" (as in chess or drafts), and
one other ("position"? "race"? somebody help!). So I'm a little curious.

The fourth category is surely "Position" and covers all the n-in-a-row games,
e.g. Nine Man's Morris and the like. Mancala is itself a sort of cross between
position and battle games, but undoubtedly deserves its own category just
because of the huge range of variants it covers.

Questions on the Mancala family keep coming up, if this group has a FAQ
Mancala should certainly be put on it.

Here's my description of the game "Kalah", one of the easier games of
the Mancala family.

The board is a 2 x 6 array of holes. One player sits by one of the
long edges of the board, the other player sits opposite. Each player
also has a "bank", or large hole, situated at the right hand end
of their side of the board.

Picture:

    BANK O O O O O O
         O O O O O O BANK     

To start the game: put 4 "stones" (beads, counters, dried beans, dung pellets)
into each of the 12 holes of the board.

To end the game: game ends when the player to move has no
legal move left.

To win the game: have the most stones in your bank when 
the game is over.

To play the game: players alternate moves, and there is only one type
of move, as follows.
Take all of the stones out of one the holes on your side of the board,
and "sow" them round the board in an anticlockwise direction.
So you put one of the stones you took in the hole to the right of
the one you took them from,  you put another in the hole to
the right of that, and so on. Should you get to the end of your side 
of the board and still have some stones left to sow, you put a stone in 
your bank; then the next stone goes in the right-hand hole on your 
opponent's side of the board. After that you proceed right-to-left through
your opponent's holes, and so on until you've sown all the stones 
that you took.

Try this on a real board, it's a lot simpler to understand than to explain!

Special rules:
You never put a stone in your opponent's bank, always skip over this when
sowing stones.
If when sowing you "orbit" the board and come back to the hole you started
from, you skip over that too, i.e. the hole you emptied at the beginning of
the move will still be empty at the end of it.
If the last stone of a sowing goes in your own bank, you get another go.
If the last stone of a sowing goes in an empty hole on your side of the
board you capture all the stones in your opponent's hole opposite. These
go straight to your bank.
You must always leave your opponent with a move, if possible.

That's it!
Beginners might like to play the game with less stones per hole
in the starting position. Play a couple of games with one stone per hole (!),
then with two, then with three. You will then appreciate what is so
cunning about the choice of four per hole in the standard game.
Advanced players start with six stones in each hole!
