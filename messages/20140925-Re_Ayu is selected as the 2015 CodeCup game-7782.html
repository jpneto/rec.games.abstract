I don't doubt that Luis's fame and celebrity will soar to staggering heights at some future time.  But all we know from the Codecup news is that Christian Freeling selected Luis's game, since Christian owns Codecup. Having your game selected by Christian Freeling is certainly commendable in its own right, but that's all it is: a selection by Christian Freeling.  Nothing more.

I does not matter if some friend help you to promote your game as long as your game is really good one (I told you that before about Ayu).
What will make suspicious is that a bad game receive this kind of help.
I`m not Christian Freeling.
I`m waiting from Christian Freeling to be honest to promote any interesting game no matter who is his inventor.
I will be happy if he chooses one of Mark Steere game to Code Up.
Yes some of MS`s games deserve more attention (if we change some of its rules).
I will not tell you which one.
I have at least 2 in mind.
They could be great games.
