What's the over/under on how many connection games you'll have designed before you're finished with them? We need a betting pool.

Yes, when will connection games finish off Luis ;-)

This one will require a bit getting used to, with the unequal diagonals, but that won't be much of a problem I suspect. Capture is a new concept here, and a very strong tactic that will enforce incorporation in any strategic planning. I'm not a priori sure how well that fits, but the concept is both simple and ingenious, so I'd have good hopes that it fits satisfactorily.

Nick has a point though, we're losing track and I can't give it the attention I would like because the ol' brain is currently wired for havannah, symple and sygo. You might want to invent 'something completely different' as, say, an interpunctuation, for chronological clarity ;-)
