Actually there's another reason. I don't have to hide my lack of
intuition behind a dogmatic approach. Your approach guarantees a
'working' game, so you're always on the safe side. But, though it
doesn't exlude a good one, it doesn't exlude a  bad one either. And it
bypasses the fact that the games that are considered 'great' by
concensus, Chess, Shogi, Go, Draughts, to name a few, do not meet your
criteria.

That games have 'good architecture' doesn't mean they're good games,
something you don't and even can't recognize, although it's clearly
illustrated by Rive and Cage. At times the ridgidness of your approach
actually mars a good concept, like Monkey Queen.
Your lack of intuition is so 'Marked' that you initially didn't even
recognize your own masterpiece Oust for what it was.
Fear of having your lack of it exposed fuels your unrelenting campaign
against it.
And fear of running dry. And I fear you're running dry.
