Imagine that I go to a game publisher company and propose them a good
idea for a game. I know this may be a rather silly question, but... if
I haven't patented my idea, couldn't they steal it to me, publish the
game, earn a lot of money and pay me nothing for my "creation
efforts"?

You need more than idea to make a good game: You need a lot of
development and game testing.  Ideas are a dime a dozen.

So even if you tell them your idea and they later publish a game based
on recognizably the same idea, they would only have "stolen" maybe 5%
of the effort in producing a game.

Let us take Trivial Pursuit as an example.  The inventors of this game
earned a fortune, but it was not due to the idea of having questions
in six categories and moving a piece around a board to collect wedges
in each category.  The reason they earned oodles of cash was the
enourmous effort they took to find questions that were funny (or had
funny answers).  Not all questions were like this, but enough that you
would have a few laughs in every game.

Scrabble is another good example: It is not the idea of building words
on a grid that makes it a good game.  It is the distribution of
letters, their values and the distribution of double/triple
letter/word squares.  And this takes a lot of effort to get right.

Magic the Gathering is even more like this: It is the large number of
cards with special abilities that makes it fun, not the idea of using
trading cards to fight a magical battle.

Even Master Mind, which seems like mostly an idea, would not be
successful without the careful design of the board and pieces.  You
could equally well play it using pen and paper (and I have done so on
occasion), but you miss the look and feel of the actual game.

This is one reason game companies are unlikely to "steal" an idea from
you: They probably have lots of ideas already and lack time to develop
them all properly, and if they use yours they risk the bother of a
lawsuit or bad press.
