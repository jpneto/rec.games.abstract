I agree with your big 4 the same way I agree with Mark J. Thompson's summary (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml">http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml</a> - for the very few who don't know it already).
