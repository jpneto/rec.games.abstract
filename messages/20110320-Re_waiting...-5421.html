In all sincerity, and on behalf of all of the contestants, I thank you for
the effort you're putting into this contest, Daniel.  Initially, I had
notions of playing all of the games myself, several times.  Now...  [shaking
head]  I couldn't possibly play them.  Not because I think they're bad games
but because my lethargic self has now fully reasserted itself, laughing at
the silly notion of me playing all the games.

Thanks btw.

One note about voting.
After discussing the 100 point method for voting with various
potential judges I've concluded that it's probably not such a good
idea in this instance.  If one judge really likes one game he can give
that game 100 points just to make sure it wins.  This really sucks if
the other judges try to distribute their points in a fair way.  I can
add this to the ballot side by side with a different voting system if
anyone is truly attached to this method.

The method that I think suits the contest best is simply writing the
games in order from favorite to least favorite.  This reflects also
the sentiment that people are picking their "favorite game" and not
one which meets a 'stacking criteria' or some other fabricated
standards.  A list also forces a logical distribution of point value
without having to fiddle with numbers as a voter.

so can I get a "oh yeah. let's definitely use the list method" from
someone?

Also If we wait to vote until I get back from Ireland I should be
meeting with a friend of mine there who has a phd in some kind of
statistical studies.  I'll ask her her input anyway, because I think
it'll be interesting.

Ok gotta run.  Let me know what you think.

Daniel
