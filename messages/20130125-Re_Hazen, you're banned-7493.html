In your ludicrous quest to show everyone how "amazing" and "brilliant" you are, Hazen, you introduced a plethora of bad games.  Here's a rundown:



EXASOTT - Unoriginal, minor variation of Sid Sackson's Hold That Line, invented in 1969.  Limited token supply. Vulnerable to mirroring. Grade D.



EXT - Uninspired, arbitrary, pointless Hex variant.  Grade D.



INTAR - Puzzle game in which players take turns waiting with their thumb up their ass for their opponent to finish a timed pentominoes puzzle.  Not even an abstract game.  Grade F.



PENTHEX - Rule set totally unspecified.  I guess the assumption is that Penthex must be "amazing" and "brilliant".  Grade F.



HALF-STONE: By your own admission, "There is a big flaw in my game."  Grade F.



ONE FOR YOU ONE FOR ME - Thoughtless adaptation of Stavropol Checkers to Hex.  Grade F.



SOZEE - By your own admission, "After playing many games I feel that I need to add a new rule.  The game Sozee is very lengthy. Some capture phases take long time to be solved.  Even if a player kill all sozee sets the game leads to a cycle."  Grade F.



Overall grade: F.  Like I said, you're banned from the group, Hazen.  That means don't come back.  Ever.

Thank you for banning me.
