  Ever seen the movie "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"?
  There is a fascinating scene in the movie where the two engage in an
oral contest that seems to follow scoring for tennis and in which the
players engage in a conversation but cannot break established rules lest
they suffer penalties.  I'd have a very hard time describing it any
further as the movie didn't explain the rules, but it seemed to revolve
around some sort of semantic or grammatical guidelines that couldn't be
broken.  Watch the movie if you can.
  For those who have seen it - is this a real game and if so, does anyone
know where the rules can be found?

Many people have written rules for this game.  Most include:

(1)  Rules are analogous to tennis, as is scoring.
(2)  Fouls are:
(2a)  Statements
(2b)  Non Sequiturs
(2c)  Rhetoric (i.e., a question not needing an answer)
(2d)  Repetitions
(2e)  Synonyms

Some people don't use rule 2e.

For an interesting twist, play the game of "Non Sequiturs" where each
statement has to be a non sequitur.  The last person to keep a straight
face wins.  (I invented this.)
