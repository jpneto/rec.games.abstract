As you can imagine, Reversi Go is simply Go with an othellonian
capture, disallowing suicide so that making true life is not
impossible:

Intriguing how sekis can secure life so often in a game which is,
apart from that, as unfriendly to life as the planet Jupiter :-). That
kind of life is also possible with suicide allowed, of course, but the
game would be as boring as 2x2 Tic-Tac-Toe. Let someone stop me making
analogies!

Thanks, that's an interesting page. I've coined the principle 'seki-
invasions'. Sygo has less trouble securing life because groups can
cooperate (in the same turn) to make eyeshape. But there's room for
seki invasions nonetheless. Eyes consisting of more points may be
prone to it. Consider a group with a 1-point eye and a 2-point eye,
then the latter can be invaded by the opponent. His stone cannot be
captured, nor can it capture, so the opponent grabs one point and
spoils two (because the vacant point in the seki is neutral). That's
the general idea behind them.
