I can't help myself, but Arimaa feels a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> like Go.

I've been thinking about how to write an AI program to play Arimaa, and all
I could think of was writing it like a go program, so I was interested to
see David's remarks. That doesn't help me much though, because I don't know
how to write a go program. I assume most go programs look for patterns, and
then generate candidate moves and evaluations based on the patterns, but I
have no idea how to do that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, 2d pattern matching is definitely a part of a Go program, but
it's a fairly hard part. There is a fair amount of literature
available on the subject. Trawling around on researchindex.org might
get you to some useful papers.

But the one time I tried to write a Go program, I used a cellular
automaton to do the strategic planning. It provided a very easy way to
propagate the influence of a single stone. I'm fairly sure that
working on the notion of influence is key for Arimaa, but you'll need
to use a more pedantic means of calculating it.

I have yet to actually finish a game, but the move system makes it into
a game of small increments. I find myself able to radically prune my
lookahead because of this fact, as well.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I didn't think most go programs used look ahead, though I can imagine how an
Arimaa program might.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In Go, you have to use some. It's actually my greatest weakness as a
Go player. Arimaa tempts you to think that look-ahead can provide a
solution, but I don't think that is in range with current computing
technologies.

Given a particular situation
in an area, it is fairy easy to determine the subset of pieces that
can influence the position over the next turn or two because you know
that there are no pieces with global influence. 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The maximum range of any piece (and that's only in the ortho-normal
directions) is 4 squares. If a piece is more than 4 squares away it
cannot come into contact with another piece in one move.

The push-pull rules also allow you to prune pieces which are providing
backup to the battle front from short-term analysis. They can't affect
your move on the opponent's next turn because they're blocked by their
own pieces.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The fact that you can
split your move among several pieces means that direct attacks are
fairly easy to foil, you have to play for a strategic position that
narrows your opponents options.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you want to think about it in Chess terms, you can take up to 4
moves in each turn. If your opponent should maneuver a piece into a
pushing position (one where he could push on his next turn), you are
under no obligation to move out of the way. You might very well be
able to move multiple backup pieces into place. Pulls are rather more
complicated to defend; I don't really have any good ideas on that
topic, but it's fairly difficult to arrange enough clear space for
a pull to be useful.

So the big issue is maneuvering your pieces so that yous opponent is
encouraged and/or limited to playing the moves that you want from
him.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Interesting. Could you give a little more detail on both of those points,
David? By the way, are you thinking of trying for the $10,000 prize?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I hope I have given more detail. No, I'm not trying for the
prize. It's just not big enough to be worth the effort. The bragging
rights would be cool, but all I'm really trying to do is understand
the game. I would only be writing code to see if I've developed good
ideas.
