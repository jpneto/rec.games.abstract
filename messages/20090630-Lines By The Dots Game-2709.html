This is a game for any plural number of players.

Start with an array of n-by-n dots, where n is decided by the players
amongst themselves. (There should be a higher n if there are more
players.)

Players take turns moving. The first player to move starts on any dot.

Each player on each of his/her moves draws two lines:
On a player's move, he/she first draws a straight vertical line from
{the dot where the last player left off [with a horizontal line, if
this is not the first move of the game]} to {any dot in the same
column as the dot the last player left off at}, making sure not to
draw the line to or through any dot that has been drawn to previously
by a line in the game.

Then the same player draws a straight horizontal line from where his/
her vertical line ended to any dot in the same row, also making sure
not to draw the line to or through any dot that has been drawn to
previously by a line in the game.

The lines may not cross or coincide with another line. (This is
obvious, since only "virgin" {not drawn to or from} dots may be drawn
TO; although a dot need not be a virgin to be drawn FROM.)


If, and only if, a player cannot draw a line of the direction
indicated by the rules, then he/she must draw a line (of the same
direction that he/she was first unable to draw during his/her move)
from any non-virgin dot to/through some of the virgin dots in the same
row/column.

Scoring is as follows:

Before a player draws a line (vertical or horizontal), enumerate the
number of non-virgin dots in the same column (if before drawing a
vertical line) or same row (if before drawing a horizontal line). The
player gets this number of dots added to his/her score.

Play continues until each dot is connected to by at least one line-
segment. (ie. until each dot is not a virgin.)

Highest score wins.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

PS: Does anyone still read Usenet anymore, by the way? Or has the
amount of spam there lately and the fact that many big internet
providers are no longer providing access to it severely cut down on
its readership?
