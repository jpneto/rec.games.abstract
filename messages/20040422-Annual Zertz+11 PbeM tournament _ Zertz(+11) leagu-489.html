Hello Zertz folks,
I'm organizing two Zertz events on the Internet this year.

First of all there will be a new Zertz+11 PbeM tournament on Richard's PbeM
Server with 16 slots (4 groups of 4 players each; established ratings will
be considered in group arrangement).
Every player plays two games against every other player in the same group.
All players winning at least 4 (out of 6) games in the first round will
proceed to the second round.
The second round will (hopefully) consist of 8 players divided into two
groups, played in the same round-robin schedule.
The best two players of both groups will proceed to the final round
competing for the title.
The results of the previous rounds will be used as tiebreakers after the
first round is played.
Every player gets 30 days per round for playing all 6 games simultaneously,
which results in not more than 60 days per round and not more than 6 months
for the whole tournament.

Additionally there will be a Zertz(+11) league at boardspace.net; the league
size is not decided yet (it'll depend on how many players are interested to
participate). The league will be played in seasons lasting some weeks.
Every player plays two games against every other player in the same league
(there will probably be only one league for the beginning) with a 15 minute
time limit per game.
Players will have to organize appointments to play their games within the
given time for the season. Missing games at the end of a season will be
scored as a loss for both players and will give a starting penalty for the
next season (except if it is clear which player caused the game not to be
played; then only this player gets a penalty and the game is scored as a win
for the other player).
It is not decided yet if Zertz or Zertz+11 is played in the first season, so
let me know which one you would prefer.


To sign up for one or both events please send an email to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:zf1@assimilate.de">zf1@assimilate.de</a>
with the following information:
- your name and your userid(s)
- in which events you want to participate
- all your questions, suggestions and comments about the events


Both events will start in May 2004 and more detailed information will become
available during the sign up period.
Just keep an eye on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://zf1.webhop.org">http://zf1.webhop.org</a> -&gt; Events.


Michael Reitz

P.S.: I hope that many players sign up for both events, so that we can find
out how much the strength of particular players differs between PbeM and
realtime play.
