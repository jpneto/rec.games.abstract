That is certainly a possibility!

Of course, you omit an even more fundamental possibility -- suppose
the first thing the players do is to vote that the game can no longer
be decided by voting?

:)

Having run this game once before, I can say that these are legitimate
problems. The only way to deal with them is to either:

  1. Let the players truly take the game to WHICHEVER direction they
     can, including the absolution of voting and or the server.

or

  2. Design and lay out some meta-rules, which are unchangeable by any
     vote.

In the first game, I chose option two. I designed a set of 3 rules
which kept the voting process from being changed without an override
by me. Thus, only the fundamental essence of the game is immutable.

Of course, it is just as easy to choose option 1, and let the players
do whatever they like. That's what will happen this time, I think.

You have the right spirit of the game, Justin. You should be a player.
