It's not like I was attacking Havannah in any way. And guys like Christian are fine with me. I guess I got used to lots of bragging during all the basketball I played as a kid?

I'm not sure about what if anything is being implied here, but I can't see any attack on Havannah. For the record, my opinion about Havannah is well documented. I consider it a decent game, but not a significant concept. More like a lucky merger. 

So much for bragging.

Sorry, i didn't mean to come off as making any accusations myself. That just seemed to be what mark was complaining about, and i was trying to disagree with him. 

I was actually saying that in an attempt to keep myself away from all the drama :/
