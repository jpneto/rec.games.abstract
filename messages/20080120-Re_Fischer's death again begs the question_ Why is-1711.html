Why is football on TV, and not chess?

The answer to that question is simple enough. I don't have to be as
strong as Johnny Unitas to appreciate a game of football. After all,
the game is more likely to be interesting if it features the best
players in the nation; thus, the Super Bowl gets higher ratings than a
regular season game. But the fact that the players are very good
doesn't make the game any <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>harder to understand<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

If really good chess players are playing against one another, though,
one has to be... intelligent - and knowledgeable about chess - to
understand what's happening.

And, after all, chess is lacking in surface excitement and immediate
gratification. Cheerleaders would distract the players. No one is
getting slammed by a body check.

The Fischer-Spassky games were a very special case, just as, say, Van
Cliburn stimulated an interest in classical piano among many who
otherwise would have paid little attention to it.
