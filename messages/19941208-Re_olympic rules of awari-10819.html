Surely this parenthetic coment is a mistake ????

In all the awari variants I ever heard of, when one of the players can't
move, the game stops, but he doesn't necessarily lose there and then - just
that his opponent gets all the remaining stones on the board.

Hmmmm... now that I look, I guess this follows logically from your rules, as
you say the game must end as soon as one has over half the stones.  But people
often play on anyway, just to see what is the margin of victory.

No.... wait a minute!  It's not <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>quite<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> logically equivalent.  It could be
that a player gets to win exactly half the stones, and then soon after gets
caught unable to move.  Standard rules state that the opponent gets all the
remaining stones, and thus this example is a DRAW, not a loss to the can't-mover.


So yes, I think the underlined remark above <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>was<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a mistake after all.

        My opinion may have changed, but not the fact that I am right.
