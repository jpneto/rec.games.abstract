Well, let me introduce it a variation on Korneliussen's Rule (call it
whatever, like The Hutnik Correlary to the Korneliussen's Rule).  It
involves a case where there is a timing mechanism used.  The variation
states that the starting player removes time from either side, and
then the second player picks what side they will play.  It is a pie
rule for the game clock in cases when it is unknown what side has an
advantage.

Any comments here?  Do people see this as a fair way to balance sides
that where balance is unknown?

Yes, there may be one advantage. The player that chooses starting
position can select an exotic opening he has studied extensively - for
both sides. Whatever side the other player chooses, he may play with a
disadvantage.

So the approach of playing with the clock would allow you to have a
Chess960 randomizer set up, and by playing with the clock, you end up
making it fair, based upon the judgment of a player?  Would it also
be, for complete fairness that the second player gets the same
position and then ends up doing the same?

This isn't really much of an issue in Hex, since there are a very
limited set of balanced openings (but it is perhaps a reason to
discourage the more complex pie rule for Hex, where the proposer gets
to make the three first moves), but I imagine it can make a difference
in Chess.
In Chess, people are also used to playing with clocks, and at many
different speeds. Time is already an important part of the game in
chess, for the faster varieties, so chess players probably have a good
idea about how to deal with that handicap. I suggest that for Fischer
chess, it's a perfectly OK way of dealing with the balance issue.

Not sure what the best way else to do this is.  One can end up
tweaking start moves, but that just ends up toying with the game too
much, in my opinion.

For other games, where blitz play is uncommon, and hence time isn't a
game element to the same degree, it may not be such a good idea. Any
pie rule introduces a new strategic element to the game, however
small, and the seriousness of these ought to be considered
individually.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I believe if a simple change makes a game a lot more richer
strategically, it should be considered.  I had toyed with the idea of
using a doubling cube, for example as an option for tournament play,
to add another meta-element to consider.  Some would argue that it
distracts from the purity of a game.  I would argue that the
introduction of a clock does similar, but has been shown on the
tournament level.
