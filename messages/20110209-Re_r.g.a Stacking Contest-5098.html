Ok, ok.  My apologies.  This was all basically my mistake.  I assumed the
contest was one way, and when I found out it was another way, slanted
against Monkey Queen, I kind of freaked out.  I wasn't pissed about the
contest being slanted against me so much as the group's insistence that a
public vote wouldn't be slanted against me.  Get real, group.

For whatever reason, I presumed the games would only be voted on by
contestants.  Seeing this:

"All entrants into the contest are more than highly encouraged to vote."

....and no corresponding mention of non-contestants voting did nothing to
alert me to the discrepancy.  Not until six weeks into the contest do I find
out that there's supposed to be a public vote.

If I knew there would be a public vote, I would never have entered the
contest, so maybe it was a good thing that I didn't know about the public
voting aspect.  Otherwise Monkey Queen wouldn't exist now.

I have the utmost interest in not knowing the public's opinion of my game. 
You probably have no idea how stupid the typical public voter will be.  One
possible, realistic evaluation of Monkey Queen:

============================================
Not a stacking game. -15
Too complicated.  -5
Totally didn't grok the moving closer thing.  -5
Ugly board and pieces.  -5
Ripoff checkers variant.  -5
Too complicated.  -5
Mark Steere snared me with a barbed insult years ago.  -65
Baby killing theme.  -5

Ok, let's see....  Oops that's over 100 already.  I guess Monkey Queen's
getting a zero.  Sorry Steere, lol

That won't happen.  If the contest is voted on only by contestants I won't
complain about the outcome.  If the contest is voted on by the public,
Monkey Queen won't be part of it.

Look, like I said, it was my mistake.  I don't want to ruin the contest by
storming off in a big huff, taking my game with me.  But I can't subject my
excellent game to a moronic public vote.  So instead, I'm offering this
proposal.  If you want to pit your game against Monkey Queen, you'll have to
do it on what I consider to be the only reasonably fair terms, and only have
the contestants vote.

If that's not agreeable, fine.  I will bow out gracefully.  Let me know what
you decide.
