The only point I am trying to make here is that procreation is ultimately just an excuse when one accomplishes fuck-all. "Hmm, I did fuck all with my life so maybe this asshole here can immortalize me". I really doubt humanity will care to preserve the resume of sophisticated games I've devised because not unlike yourself yourself they are navel-gazing ingrates. But the salient point here is that if you really want to leave something behind, its better for it to be a groundbreaking board game than some more mouths to feed. And good god, I really hope we don't develop the kind of AI you spoke of because then we would be proliferating consciousness in new and yet more odious ways.

Carteso or Cartezero?

ha ha ha 

They call it a game!!! An the bgg maffia run to thumb up a crappy game as usual (16!!!!).
The maffia know the rules : if a game is designed by maffia members then run to thumb up him without even reading the rules and use the words " wonderful, elegant, simple, I will give it try, how did not we think to it, and so on.
Every time I go to read bgg forum I can stop laughing.
I open a new beer.
Game designers are becoming worse than Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
Deeply dumb.
