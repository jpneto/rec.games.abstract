American Grosstarock or Omnibus Tarot is a point trick game in which
the partnerships vary from hand to hand. It is played by four players.

Cards
A standard French tarot deck of 78 cards is used. 
There are four standard suits of 14 cards each, 
21 trumps.  
One special card, the fool (excuse). 
The standard suits, clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades each have four
court cards.
The corner indices stand for the French names of the cards.
the king  marked R for roi; 
the queen  or lady marked D for dame; 
the knight  or rider marked C for cavalier; 
the jack or servant  marked V for valet. 
Each suit also has the usual 10 pip cards  marked with numbers 1
through 10.
In the black suits (spades and clubs) the cards are ranked from high
to low:
Roi (king), Dame (queen), Cavalier (knight), Valet (jack), 10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
In the red suits (hearts and diamonds) the pip cards have the same
ranking;
from high to low the cards rank: 
Roi (king), Dame (queen), Cavalier (knight), Valet (jack), 10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
The trumps are marked with the numbers 1 through 21, 
and are ranked in numerical order with 21 highest and 1 lowest.
There is a special card called the excuse, or the fool, marked with a
star in the corner.
Three cards, the 1 of trump (called the petit or pagat), the 21 of
trump and the excuse are particularly important in the game and are
known as bouts ("ends"), oudlers or the Trull.

Values of the cards
For every card in every trick taken, you get the following card
points:
Trull (21, 1, excuse):  4.5 points each
Kings:  4.5 points each
Queens: 3.5 points each
Knights: 2.5 points each
Jacks: 1.5 points each
Other cards: 0.5 points each
The total of the card points is 91. 

The Deal
Before the first deal, all the cards are laid down backside and each
player chooses one up.
The lowest card designates the first Dealer. A Trump is higher than
any suit card. The Excuse is the highest card. If there is equality,
the following priority order between the suits is applied: Spades -
Hearts - Diamonds - Clubs. Therefore the 1 of Clubs always designates
the first Dealer. For the next deals, the player placed on the right
side of the previous Dealer becomes the new one.- thereafter the turn
to deal passes to the right after each hand (the whole game is played
counter-clockwise). The player opposite the dealer shuffles and the
player to the left of the dealer cuts. In a hand, 18 cards are dealt
to each player, in packets of 3. During the deal, six cards are dealt
face down to the center of the table to form the talon. The talon
cards are dealt singly at any time during the deal, at the choice of
the dealer, escept that the first three and the last three cards of
the deck cannot be dealt to the talon. A player who is dealt only the
petit and no other trumps (counting the excuse as a trump) immediately
declares this and the hand is cancelled - the cards are thrown in and
the next dealer deals.

The Contracts
Each player, starting with the player to the dealer's right and
continuing counter-clockwise, has just one chance to bid on the hand,
or pass. If someone bids, subsequent players have the choice of
bidding higher or passing. If all four players pass, Trischaken or
Ramsch is played
The possible bids, from lowest to highest, are as follows: 

Rufer: 
Declarer chooses a partner by calling a king, and gets to exchange six
cards with the the talon. Kings, excuse, petit and trump 21 may not be
exchanged into the talon
 
Solorufer: 
Declarer chooses a partner by calling a king, but does not change
cards with the talon. The 6 cards of the talon are put aside unseen
and added to the defenders' tricks at the end of the hand..

Before exposing the talon, the declarer calls a king and the player
who has that card plays as the partner of the taker; the other two
players play as a team against them. If the declarer has all four
kings, he may call a queen.  If the declarer has all four queens, he
may call a knight.  If the declarer has all four knights, he may call
a jack. If the declarer has all four jacks, he may call a trump other
than petit, excuse or 21.  The holder of the called card must not say
anything to give away the fact that he has it. The identity of the
declarer's partner is only revealed when the called card is played or
during the declaration of a combination (cavalerie or kings), though
it may be suspected earlier from the fact that the holder of the king
will try to help the declarer. If the called card is found to be in
the Talon or in the hand of the declarer, then the declarer plays
alone against three opponents.

Dreier: 
Declarer plays alone against the other three players, and gets to
exchange six cards with the talon. Kings, excuse, petit and trump 21
may not be exchanged into the talon

Solodreier: 
Declarer plays alone and the talon goes unseen to the opponents'
tricks.

Trischaken or Ramsch is played if a deal is passed by all. The player
who takes the most card points loses. In Trischaken, declarer leads to
the first trick, rather than the player on dealer's right. The rules
of play are different in Trischaken: when it is your turn to play, you
are forced to beat the cards already played if you can. In addition,
in Trischaken it is illegal to play the Petit unless it is your last
trump.

Bonuses . The score depends on whether they were announced before the
beginning of the play These are only available if Trischaken is not
played.

Trull/Oudlers Taking all three of the excuse, 21 and  petit in your
side's tricks + talon cards. .

4 Kings  Taking all 4 kings in your side's tricks + talon cards. 

Capture Called King.  The opponents capture the king  of the suit
which the declarer called to determine the partnerships. If a trump is
called instead of a king, queen, knight, or jack, this bonus is
achieved by capturing the called trump.

Petit Ultimo. This is a bonus which occurs if the petit is played in
the last trick. In such a case, the team that takes the last trick
wins this bonus.

The above bonuses score +20 if announced and achieved, -10 if
announced and failed, and +10 if achieved and unannounced

King Ultimo  This is a bonus which occurs if the king of the called
suit is played in the last trick. In this case the team that takes the
last trick wins this bonus: +20 if announced and achieved, -10 if
announced and failed, and +10 if achieved and unannounced. Winning the
last trick containing a king of another suit scores: +10 if announced
and achieved, -5 if announced and failed, and +5 if achieved and
unannounced. If a trump is called instead of a king, queen, knight, or
jack, winning the last trick containing a king of any suit scores;+10
if announced and achieved, -5 if announced and failed, and +5 if
achieved and unannounced

Slam Winning all the tricks. All cards from the talon are surrendered
to the winning side if Slam is made +400 if announced and achieved,
-200 if announced and failed, and +200 if achieved and unannounced. If
one side has won all the tricks except the last, and then leads the
excuse to the last trick, the excuse wins. This special rule allows a
slam to be made by a player with the excuse. When making a slam with
the excuse in this way, it counts as petit ultimo if you win the petit
in the second to last trick.

The play of the cards
When the discard is complete, the cards are played. The player to the
dealer's right leads to the first trick. Each trick is won by the
highest trump in it, or the highest card of the suit led if no trumps
were played. The winner of a trick leads to the next. You have to
follow suit if you can, and if you have no cards of the suit which was
led you must play a trump. If trumps are led, the other players must
of course follow with trumps if they can.

Playing the excuse
The excuse is an exception to the above rules. If you hold the excuse
you may play it to any trick you choose - irrespective of what was led
and whether you have that suit or not. The excuse, with one exception,
can never win the trick  - the trick is won as usual by the highest
trump, or in the absence of trumps by the highest card of the suit
led. It is legal to lead the excuse, and in this case the second
player to the trick can play any card, and this second card defines
what suit must be followed. The team that played the excuse keeps it
in their trick pile, even though they may have lost the trick to which
it was played. If the trick is in fact won by the opponents of the
player of the excuse, the trick will be one card short; to compensate
for this, the team that played the excuse must transfer one card from
their trick pile to the winners of the trick. This will be a 0.5 point
card; if they do not yet have such a card in their tricks, they can
wait until they take a trick containing a 0.5 point card and transfer
it then.

 The combinations. These are only available if Trischaken is not
played. Certain combinations of cards in a player's hand may be
declared. To make a declaration, the holder must show it just before
playing to the first trick.  The combinations are counted for the team
who wins the hand, so if you make a declaration and then lose, you
have given the  points to the other side. A combination is only scored
if it is declared. It is not compulsory to make a declaration.

Trumps 
A player holding 10 or more trumps may declare how many he has. For
this purpose, the Excuse counts as a trump. When trumps are declared,
the player must also indicate whether or not he holds the petit.
10 trumps = 20. 
11 trumps = 30. 
12 trumps = 40. And so on (10 more for each additional trump).

Matadors 
3 matadors is the combination of the Excuse, the trump 21, and the
petit. 4 matadors additionally includes the trump 20. 5 matadors
additionally includes the trump 19, etc. A player holding the Excuse,
the trump 21, and the petit may  declare how many matadors he holds.
3 matadors = 20. 
4 matadors = 30. 
5 matadors = 40. And so on (10  more for each additional matador). 

Cavallerie 
A player who holds four court cards of the same suit may declare full
cavallerie of the suit. If in addition to the four court cards, he
also holds the Excuse, he declares abundant cavallerie. And if he
holds three court cards of the same suit and the Excuse, he declares
half cavallerie and shows which court card he is missing.

Kings 
A player holding all four kings may declare "full kings". With all
four kings and the Excuse, he declares "abundant kings".  With three
kings and the Excuse, he declares "half kings" and indicates  the suit
in which he is missing the king;
abundant kings or cavallerie: 30;
full kings or cavallerie: 20; 
half kings or cavallerie: 10

The scoring
At the end of the hand, the  declarer and partner count their card
points and the opposing team pool their tricks and count their card
points. The six Talon  cards are added to the declarer's  or the
opponents' tricks, depending on the contract.
The amount of points won or lost by the declarer is calculated as
follows:
Find the difference between the card points won by the declarer and
partner  and the card points won by the opponents.
Add or subtract  these bonuses as applicable: 
Trull, 4 Kings, Capture Called King , Petit Ultimo,  and King Ultimo
This total is multiplied  depending on contract;
Rufer x 1
Solorufer x 2
Dreier x 4
 Solodreier x 8
The following combinations are then added or subtracted as they apply;
Trumps,  Matadors, Cavallerie, and Kings. Add or subtract the Slam
bonus as it applies.
The calculation of the score is thus : 
{[ (declarer-defender) + bonuses] x contract} + combinations + slam. 
The score of the defenders is the negative of the above. 
In Trischaken, all four play as individuals and the Talon is not used.
In Trischaken Card points count as negative.
