Strictly speaking, there are two exceptions. The second one specifies
two possible circumstances which cause a game to end: two consecutive
passes and a capture which removes all the opponent's stones. Without
this rule, cycles would arise after a full board capture, as in the
last example.

Yes, and nothing prevents a Go player from filling in his own eyes,
leaving the last for the opponent, and having his groups captured,
creating room for more moves and so on.
Go rules always have required mutual understanding and agreement, and
full board captures ... they don't really happen, do they.
Not that it hurts to mention it explicitly.

This is a case of hard finitude versus soft finitude, to borrow two or
your terms. Of course, Go is already soft-finite, so opening the door
to cycles, no matter how unlikely they may be, would have defeated the
very purpose of my game.

But it's more than that. In Go, sensible play never leads to filling
your own eyes, but, in Goncrete, sensible play (I mean, without
cooperation between the players) can well lead to a full board
capture, especially in 9x9 games between differently skilled players,
where the weaker player may be unable to create a single alive group.

Oh, there's also a minor issue I have just noticed: in Sygo rules, I
think you forgot to mention explicitly that non-capturing suicidal
placements are illegal. You do mention it in the examples, but not in
the formal rules, where you only talk about illegal post-capture
suicides, so to speak.
