(Crappy game # 1.)

This is a game for any plural number of players.
Start with an n-by-n grid, lightly and carefully drawn.

(Below, by "line-segment", it is meant a line-segment drawn as part of
play. This does not refer to the lines of the grid.)

To start, any one player, other than the player who first draws a line-
segment in the game, draws 3 dots on the grid, each dot at a different
grid-vertex.

Thereafter, players take turns. On his move, a player connects
(almost*) any two dots with a straight line-segment. (No line-segments
may coincide for a positive length, but they may cross.)
In the same move, the player next draws d dots, each at a different
grid-vertex without any dots yet and without any line-segments
crossing through, where d is the number of dots (0, 1, or 2) the
player just connected that didn't have any line-segments connected to
them before the move.

The player gets added to his score the number of preexisting (ie. made
before the move) line-segments his segment crosses PERPENDICULARLY.

Play until all (n+1)^2 grid-vertices (including the edge vertices) are
either crossed by line-segments or have dots drawn on them.

Largest score wins.

Also: No line-segment should pass through a dot without terminating at
it.

*Optional rule: There shall be no more than 3 line-segments
terminating at any dot.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
