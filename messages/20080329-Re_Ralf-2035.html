This is one of the things no person can meaningfully say about
himself. Even though many people here in the (admit it, very narrow)
abstract game community like your games, I'd like to see one of them
come up as a character witness. "Mark Steere is not cranky! He's just
misunderstood!" LOL!

I've read Gering's complaints now, and although the man definitively
has allowed himself to be winded up by you way too much, there's much
in there that I witnessed myself.

My impression is that you are a guy who can be very charming when you
want something (like getting your games implemented), but explode and
become very abusive when you don't get your way, or when someone
questions your positions.

You want to promote your games, right? Here's a hint: No matter how
good they are, they won't be judged on their merits alone. There are
probably thousands of people who like designing abstract games. Most
of them don't have your experience, but they may have other advantages
(such as being players themselves, willingness to playtest their
games, write their own software, soliciting review from respected
abstract game players...) If you insist on being an abusive crank in
public, it's time to give attention to other designers rather than you
- you have just used up your share of goodwill.

I know it's probably futile, and you'll just answer this with more
abuse, but I repeat: This is meant as friendly advice. If you can
manage to be civil, and <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>stay<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> civil, your games will have a much
better chance.
