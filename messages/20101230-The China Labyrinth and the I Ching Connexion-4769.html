I Ching Connexion:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion</a>

This is a conversation copied from the Stacking Contest thread,
regarding Cameron Browne's new game "Stax":
*******************
Christian:
The complete set, including the two asymmetric 3's, is again a subset
of the "China Labyrinth" set.

Cameron:
Interesting! I wasn't wasn't aware of the correlation with the I
Ching. Maybe the two could be combined somehow?

Christian:
It's more than a correlation, the China Labyrint and the I Ching are
one and the same, the former only gives a completely natural and
endlessly varied graphical representation of the hexagrams of the
latter, and the way they interrelate in any specific divination.
Though Ed and I made it work, and though I copied the whole Legge
translation manually into it, I don't use it myself.

Cameron:
I guess the obvious way to apply the I Ching Connexion principle to
Stax is that each player view the tiles in front of them as the
associated hexagrams, and as tiles are rotated their meanings change
to the newly formed ones.
For example, tile 4 Meng (Youthful Inexperience) when rotated one step
clockwise would become tile 3 Chun (Initial Difficulties):
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams</a>

So a story would unfold as the game is played, and it would be
different for each player. Players could rotate pieces, pin pieces or
reveal pieces to change the story in meaningful ways, e.g. Joy might
be used to hide The Abyss. Keen players might even choose suboptimal
moves if it improved their story :)
*******************

I find it interesting to discuss the idea, but the Stacking thread
isn't a very good place for it, so I started this one.

Let me say on a personal note that when I discovered the one-to-one
correspondence of the hexagons of the Labyrinth and the hexagrams of
the I Ching, shortly after Martin Medema had conceived the China
Labyrinth, I felt obliged to follow through with an implementation of
the obvious implications: providing the graphical representation of
the way the hexagrams interact in any given divination. Ed van Zon
agreed and wrote the program. I manually copied the text of the Legge
translation into it, a translation I prefer above the 'Wilhelm'.
We worked very conscientiously at it and published it free for all to
use.
Neither Ed nor I use it ourselves, and I am not interested in
discussions regarding the I Ching itself, what it is, what it does and
what, if anything, it all means. But building a game around it is fine
with me.

In that respect, and now I'm back to Cameron: in Stax the first
hexagram is present, unmovable and unchanging, how fitting :) , but
there are two asymmetrical threes missing - that's twelve hexagrams.
Those would have to be included in a new game - and we're talking
about a new game here, right :)

I've put it before the IC Connexion: "how about a new I Ching game?"
It gave:
Actual hexagram:
4. Meng - Youthful Inexperience
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/218-4-meng">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/218-4-meng</a>

Future hexagram:
59. Huan - Dispersal
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/273-59-huan">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/273-59-huan</a>

The fifth line - "Showing its subject as a simple lad without
experience. There will be good fortune." - closes under the waning
infuence of 24. Fu - The Turning Point
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/238-24-fu">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/hexagrams/238-24-fu</a>

Actual an Future hexagram were positioned one diagonal step apart,
which suggests a very short time frame leading from one to the other.
So we got the blessing, I guess, from Whoever's Up There :)
