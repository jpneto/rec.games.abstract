Los&gt; My question is- is there any kind of a Nomic MUD back up on the
Los&gt; internet?  The faq mentioned one but said it was shut down, and I
Los&gt; was wondering if this was still the case.  If there is not, is
Los&gt; there any kind of place I can go to play/get more info about
Los&gt; Nomic?

most of the extant games of nomic on the net are conducted by email.
i've seen hints of one or two being conducted via world wide web.

if i had a site i could theoretically put up an interactive game (it
wouldn't quite be a mud, as using a full-blown mud driver to support
nomic is probably overkill).  unfortunately, none of the
internet-accessible sites i have access to would allow me to run a
mud.

i am considering starting up another email nomic-type game, with a
initial ruleset similar to, but significantly different from, that
used by agora.  if you're interested, send me email. :)

Los&gt; I'm awaiting a copy of Douglas Hofstaeder's article in my library
Los&gt; now...

by the way, douglas hofstadter's email address is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:dughof@indiana.edu">dughof@indiana.edu</a>.
i do not know how often, or even if, he reads email there, but the
indiana university whois database gives that as his email address. :)
