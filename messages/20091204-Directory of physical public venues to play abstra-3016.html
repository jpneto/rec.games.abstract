The directory is here:
If you were looking for public physical venues open to people playing
abstract strategy games at them, then check this directory out here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://Venues.IAGOClubhouse.com">http://Venues.IAGOClubhouse.com</a>

We also could use more. We are looking at what should be over 100
venues in all 50 states in the United States. We would like to get
more into this directory, for not just the United States, but also the
rest of the world.

On the page is a link to a guide to finding physical venues, if you
need help finding one not in the directory currently.  Please contact
me through the abstractgamers.org forum if you have more.  On the
Clubhouse website is also an email address.

There may be a question as to why this list is needed.  As per a guide
to finding venues:  In the "ecosystem" of games, an essential part is
physical venues to meet at. These venues serve for a way to meet new
people in a safer environment, rather than the homes of individuals.
Expanding and recruiting players is a challenge without having places
like this to meet. Advertising and promotion of meetings is
challenging also, and homes will often face space restrictions.
Because of this, public venues are essential to the "ecosystem" of
game players.
