No offence Gert, but that was a bit of a 'lazy' suggestion, not quite
fitting a beautiful concept.

I think the basic concept of the game is very simple and beautiful,
too.

The suggestion was lazily formulated.
I hope this is better:

"A single piece moves and captures one or two squares in any straight
direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally)."

There's another problem with the two-squares jump. In january 1982 my
son Demian was recovering from the mumps and I asked him to design a
chess variant (he had played several variants including Xiangqi).

I was inspired by the elephant of Xiangqi, but even more by the
starting move of the chess pawn.
I tested it in the sandbox on igGameCenter.

Of course, I don't want to butt in your game design. I just like to
discuss about abstract games. Thank you very much for commenting on my
suggestions.
