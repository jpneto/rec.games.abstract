I disagree with that.  Randomizing the positions of neutral elements
of the game (not including players' pieces) before either player takes
a turn can result in a perfect information game.  The problem is that
the random setup of neutral elements may create a strong advantage for
the first move player or for the second move player.  In a game like
Go, where you have a measurable advantage for the first move player at
various skill levels you can apply different handicaps at these
various skill levels to level the playing field.  You can't do that in
a game with a random initial setup of neutral elements.  So with
random initial setups of neutral elements, yes, you can have a perfect
information game but the equitableness is dubious at best.

My inclination would be to exclude games with any randomness,
including initial random setups of neutral elements.

Having a game free of a fixed set up results in a game which is deeper

Yes and no.  Yes it has more replayability since you don't have a
catalog of opening plays.  But no that has no impact on the depth of a
game.

There is the fairness issue with variable set ups, like in Fischer's
Random Chess.  As a solution to that, I would argue that IAGO would
need to have players play both black and white.

I don't like that at all.  You're essentially altering a game by
making it be played twice.  For one thing you're doubling the
duration.  For another thing if there's no possibility of a tie in a
particular game, now by converting it into a double played version of
itself there is the possibility of a tie.

A game should be judged on its own merits, not on the merits of a
doubled conversion of itself.

In the case of
Through the Desert, a bidding system could be used if need be to see
who goes first.

Again, no.  A game should be judged on its own merits, not on an
augmented version of itself which now includes a bidding system.

Possibly the same idea of remembering the set up of
the pieces, and having everyone play every position and then comparing
scores.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

More bull crap.  Just judge a game on its own merits, not on a bull
crap conversion of itself, especially one which requires the
memorization of a complex initial setup which must be replayed a
second time.
