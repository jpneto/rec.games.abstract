Quoting Mabon Dane's message of Yesterday:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There has been plenty of celtic stories about Gwyddbwyll.  Can anyone
tell me about what this game is?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Opinion is divided.  Some say it is a game from the Viking tafl group.
Others (including H J R Murray) think it is a variant of the Roman ludus
latrunculorum.  I'm not sure which side I agree with.  Both games have
probably been discussed on this newsgroup in the past.

In case you've heard of neither of them:

Ludus latrunculorum is a war game with two sides of equal forces, the
object of which is (probably) to capture all of the opponent's forces.
Later games seem to have had a king-piece on each side, but its use is
not known.

Tafl is a hybrid between a war game and a hunt game (some class it fully
as a hunt game, but I think that's a bit simplistic).  A king and a
number of men face an enemy which has no king but double the number of
men.  The king must reach the periphery of the board, and his enemies
must capture him.

Both games share similar movement and capture rules: movement is along
an orthogonal line like a chess rook, and capture is by surrounding an
enemy on two opposite orthogonal sides.

Of all the information extant about gwyddbwyll, nothing tells us how it
was played.  Its date seems to be between the Romans leaving and the
arrival of the Vikings.
