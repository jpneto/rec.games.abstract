More than needed I think. Of the 154 Shakti games at iGGC, 72 were for
the first player, 66 for the second and 16 ended in a draw. That's a
bit on the drawish side.

The some 30 computer programs that played Caïssa in the 2003 Code Cup
Challenge had 33 draws in a double round contest.

That's a lot better.

This whole discussion kind of highlights why I make my games finite.
Players will find a way to "cause trouble" for your game if there's any
possible way to do so, especially if they're Chess variants with a
combinatorial flavor. Shogi succeeds where Chess fails because of the
increased complexity. With decreased complexity, the opposite occurs.
Draws will find a way in decreased complexity, non-finite Chess variants.

Chess is still fairly popular for a failing game, I must say. But yes,
cutting out the draw serves a purpose. Point is, I don't care as much
as you do on this particular point. None of the Atlantis triplets will
ever be more that an ad hoc recreational game. None will be subject to
rigorous analysis. They're for fun.

Having said that, the increased mobility and flexibility of the pieces
serves Cyclix. It isn't so much that the kings became 'relatively
stronger' but that the king and the pieces suffered from the
diminishing playing area in the same degree. And that is not what the
Atlantis mechanism is about. It serves to eventually trap the king.
And that shouldn't be too much of a long and winding road for a
tactical miniature. Shakti is already borderline in that respect.

On the same note I would probably have considered a Queen not to give
birth if moving out of check in MQ. The same argument as for capture:
it's hard to give birth if you're occupied otherwise. I feel the mid-
game attacks would be more likely to succeed and more tempting. As it
is, an attack that fails faces extra babies born on the run. Makes you
think twice.
In that sense I feel MQ as it is does indeed need 'limited fuel
supply' and a confrontational mechanism in the endgame. But I feel mid-
game attacks are more fun and should be stimulated.
