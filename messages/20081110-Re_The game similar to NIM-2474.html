all rules are the same like in classic 'nim' game except one rule -
the
number of stones in heaps are nondecreasing (e.g. (1,2,2,6,7), not
(5,1,7)). After every move this rule must be keep. So player can
remove stones from heap X only and only if in heap to the left are
less piles and he can't remove more stones, than difference between
heap X and heap to the left. For example:

1 3 5 6

player can make 6 moves:
 - take 1 stone from 1. heap (after move - (3,5,6))
 - take 1 stone from 2. heap (1,2,5,6)
 - take 2 stones from 2. heap (1,1,5,6)
 - take 1 stones from 3. heap (1,3,4,6)
 - take 2 stones from 3. heap (1,3,3,6)
 - take 1 stone from 4. heap (1,3,5,5)

What is the winning strategy in this game? I know about winning
strategy in the classic 'nim' game. I would be gratful for
help.

The standard NIM strategy revolves around XORing the (binary) numbers
for the heaps.  The important properties are:

 1. If the XOR is 0, any single move will make it non-0.

 2. If the XOR is non-zero, a move exists that will make it 0.

There are two variants of NIM, one where the objective is to remove
the last stone, and one where the objective is not to.  The first
simply makes sure to leave the XOR 0 after each move.  The second does
this until exactly one pile has more than one stone.  At this point,
it removes from that pile to leave an odd number of piles with one
stone each.  I will, for simplicity, assume that we are using the
first variant, i.e., the winner takes the last stone.

It is obvious that property one holds even under the restrictions, so
we need to see if property 2 still holds.

We can look at 1,3,3,7.  In binary, this is

             1
            11
            11
           111
         -----
XOR:       110

It is clear that we must remove from the last pile to get rid of the
first one-bit of the XOR, but the only resulting number that would
make the XOR 0 is 1, which breaks the restriction of keeping the
sequence non-decreasing.  So we need a different "safe" property.

One property that is definitely safe is the following: The sequence
consists of pairs of identical numbers, e.g., 1,1,3,3,4,4.  If a move
removes a numer of tokens from one pile, the counter move is to remove
the same number from the next pile, which reestablishes a sequence of
pairs.  Conversely, any sequence that can be made into a sequence of
pairs by a single move is unsafe.

However, this does not characterize all safe and unsafe sequences.
The simplest case not covered above is 1,1,2.  This is safe, as the
two possible moves leave 1,2 and 1,1,1, which are both unsafe.  This
makes any position that can be reduced to 1,1,2 by one move, i.e.,
1,2,2 and 1,1,X, where X&gt;2, unsafe.  We already knew that 1,2,2 was
unsafe (it can be reduced to 2,2), but 1,1,(2+n) is new.

I can not see any simple characterization for all sequences, though.
