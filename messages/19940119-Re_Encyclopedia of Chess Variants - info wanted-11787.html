	The best reference on chess varistions in print (at least until Prit-
chard's book comes out) is World Game Review #10, obtainable for $10 from
Michael Keller at 1747 Little Creek Drive / Baltimore MD 21207.

As long as I have the ear of those of you interested in variants, has
anyone tried a game along the following lines? The basic idea, which
I'll call "Wizard Chess", is that the Queen is replaced by a "Wizard"
who moves and captures like a king but is allowed to be placed or left
en prise. The Wizard may also move by swapping places with any friendly
piece (not pawn), including the King. I'm much too rank a beginner at
standard chess to be able to tell if this variation offers much of a
challenge. My guess is that the game will be much slower; also, you
basically have to checkmate your opponent twice to win, and the
teleporting may make things rather chaotic, but not much more so than
Shogi. Any other opinions?

	I can envision a draw by Perpetual Swap. The King swaps with the
Wizard, the mating piece swaps with its Wizard (in what should be a mating
position somewhere else on the board), whereupon the king swaps back, the
mating piece swaps back, etc. Suggestion: either don't allow king swaps at
all, or at least don't allow king swaps on two consecutive moves. To cut   
down drastically on Perpetual Swap positions, don't allow the Wizard to
swap with the same piece of any kind on two consecutive turns. I suppose
you could still get a Triple Perpetual Swap, like a Triple Ko, but I will
leave the problemists in the audience to construct a suitable and enter-
taining example.
