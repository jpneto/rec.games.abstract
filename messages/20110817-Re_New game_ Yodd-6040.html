Endgames are also quite tricky under this rule: you'll often want to
join two of your own groups or create another opponent group, but
you'll be unable to do it because you can't restore the groups count
anymore!

Splyt sounds nice too, but the object is as much to Joyn ;-)

I have some trouble visualizing how one could plan ahead. Of course
this becomes increasingly possible towards the endgame, but how to get
to a 'favorable' middlegame or how to plan in the opening, those are
aspects that elude me at the moment. I also feel a shadow of a "nim-
like" algorithm, but that may not be the case at all. Of course not
having to count (if players are paying attention) is a great plus.
My first impression is a tactical game in the 'fairly obscure
strategy' category (of which Othello is a known representative).

P.S. It can be played with standard material, so it's clearly not a
Kris Burm game ;-)

Better than that - it's a pen and paper game.
At a push, you can even play it on squared paper.
