|&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had anybody ever considered 3-D go?
|&gt; &gt;&gt;
|&gt; &gt;&gt;Lots of people, but it's hard to get anywhere. Reasons follow.

|&gt; &gt;&gt;Here's the first big problem: a single stone can have up to six
|&gt; &gt;&gt;liberties, compared with four. Two connected stones have ten liberties,
|&gt; &gt;&gt;instead of six. So every time you add a stone to a line and your
|&gt; &gt;&gt;opponent forms his own wall alongside, you get three extra liberties,
|&gt; &gt;&gt;instead of the one you get in two-dimensional go. Imagine how easy it
|&gt; &gt;&gt;would be to dodge in go if you could run away straight up or straight
|&gt; &gt;&gt;down. This makes encircling groups, and hence territory, very much
|&gt; &gt;&gt;harder. Hard enough it probably isn't interesting. In a way it's a
|&gt; &gt;&gt;	[...]
|&gt; 
|&gt; How about a go game that starts with a randomly generated graph,
|&gt; rather than the rectangular grid pattern?
|&gt; 
|&gt; Each node would be connected to 4 other nodes, but they would
|&gt; be randomly chosen. New configuration would be generated
|&gt; for each game.
|&gt; 

I find the idea of a random lattice very appealing.  It would provide for
very unusual strategy.  The obvious point about 3-D go, is that a tetrahedral
lattice is both regular and gives each point four neighbors.  I haven't seen
anyone raise this possibility yet.  As for what it would do to the strategy,
who knows?  I'd like to give it a try if anyone comes up with a way. 

The random lattice doesn't require three dimensions.  You can generate the
same network on two dimensions, you'll just have a lot more crossing lines
if you draw it out.
