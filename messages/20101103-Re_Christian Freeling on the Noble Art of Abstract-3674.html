Jackspritz: I get the entertainment value argument.  You guys like
fighting and it's funny.  I enjoy it too, when I'm not frustrated that
nobody is productively discussing the games themselves (note: pointing
out a game is crap isn't productive, even if it's true, unless you are
doing it to help the designer improve.  This requires thoughtful,
specific, non-dismissive discussion of the game in question).

If you guys could figure out a way to keep the fighting going without
killing games discussion, go for it.

Speaking specifically to the point of defending games against Steere-
bombs: not necessary.  Mark dislikes most games and nobody should be
offended if hates any particular one.  But Mark: it would be nice if
you treated the more sensitive posters here with kid-gloves.  I know
it's not your thing, but I'd appreciate it if you'd maybe just test-
drive the idea or something.
