This morning I waked up earlier. So I decided to read the Nestor game design contest. Use rings and pawns to create a game.

I will never participate to any contest simply because I hate all the rewarding system (Nobel Fields Medal Goncourt and so on). It is often biased open only to kow-towing people.

It took me 2 hours of reflexion and here is my game.

I will post it tomorrow as soon as I finish it.

Hey Mark! You will be really surprised (badly? happily?).

I do not know but I want your comments before anyone else.

I know that you are avaricious when it comes to the words insults excepted.

But I will be happy to hear your opinion.

I'll be happy to comment on your game, but I don't see a link.  One more reason not to participate in the Nestor contest: Nestor himself.  He's a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>major<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> plagiarist, ripping  off other games and lying about it.  If I saw him in person I'd punch his face.
