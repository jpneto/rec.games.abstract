Not sure if I understand that about ten stacks of 6 stones each on a cell.

No stone is removed from the board.
The secret here is the placement by swapping.
Let us say that the 2 players have placed their 6 stones in cells such as the cells are adjacents forming some sort of group.
The only way to place a stone outside the cells is to rule the move by swapping. You take a stone from your stack you swap it with an unfriendly cell and you move the same way until you get out to a targeted cell.
Here the stones are neutrals as it was in Game in progress (it is obvious! because you have to connect stones of your colour)
