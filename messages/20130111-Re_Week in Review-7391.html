What lies? You just don't remember half the shit you told me because it seems normal to you.  I remember because it's off the fucking wall.  Like the cache of high powered weapons you're planning as soon as you can save enough money.  You know, the one you "honestly don't remember... but I'll admit it does sound like something I'd say"?  If you can say something like that and not remember, you're a "sick fuck".

What does a retard like you need with a weapons cache?  And why would anyone sell them to you?  In America, retards aren't allowed to buy weapons.

Man you're dangerous.  It's only a matter of time before you go on a rampage.  Hopefully the mounties can lock you up before you do any damage.  Retarded Corey Clark with a weapons cache.  What's wrong with this picture?
