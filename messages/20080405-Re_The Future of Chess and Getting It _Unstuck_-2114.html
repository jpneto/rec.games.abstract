Intense Chess is not that much different from standard four-player
chess in its normal form, but they also have two-player and three-
player rules.

The article on Intense Chess in D. B. Pritchard's _Encyclopedia of
Chess Variants_ has a photo of the three Polgar sisters sitting down
to play a game.

My own page, at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.quadibloc.com/chess/ch0206.htm">http://www.quadibloc.com/chess/ch0206.htm</a>

mentions the main unique feature of Intense Chess: once one player's
King is checkmated, that King, and the other pieces of that player,
are immediately removed from the board. This is unlike traditional
four-player Chess, where both Kings in a partnership must become
simultaneously checkmated for a victory for the other side to take
place.
