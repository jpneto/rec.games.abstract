Is anyone still listening to this guy?  At first it seemed that there
was some legitimate concern that some people might take the situation
the wrong way, and so it was worth explaining the true facts.  Now that
that's been done, as far as I can tell, there is just one bozo who has a
problem with the match.  There's always going to be at least one person
with a chip on the shoulder about something or other.  I suggest that we
all just ignore him and eventually he will go away.
