Also note the Fischer-Spassky match had a fixed 24-game limit.  I
think the next few were "first to X wins", which means that they would
have no idea how many weeks it would last.  It's hard to find TV time
under these conditions.

Why couldn't you do a time compress edit on chess matches and also not
have chess matches split a draw 1/2-1/2 and then have highest score
after a fix number of games?

I think it has something to do with complaints that whoever had the
lead would start "playing for a draw" in order to protect the lead.

Apparently, the 2008 world chess championship will be most wins after
12 games, with a 6-6 tie broken by some sort of one-day tiebreaker (I
think the "if all else fails" tiebreaker is one game where White gets
a total of 6 minutes and Black 5, but Black wins if the game ends in
what would normally be a draw).

However, in my opinion, the main problem with doing this on TV is,
it's not a one-show thing - and while you can say that about the World
Series of Poker as well, at least poker is a game that most people
understand on sight.
