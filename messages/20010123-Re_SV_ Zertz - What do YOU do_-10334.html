I don't mean this in a mean spirited way, but after reading your post
Justin all I could think about was someone saying something like...

"You just swing your bat and hit the ball over the fence.  What is there
not to understand?"

Anyway, back onto the subject.  I've only played a handful of times, and
I'm impressed how early in the game I've started planning things out.
At first, I played the first 4 or so marbles in a random sort of way.
Now, I'm trying to set things up from the start.  A very nice game.

Sorry, but that didn't answer your question at all.
