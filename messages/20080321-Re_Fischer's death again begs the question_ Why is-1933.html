<br>Factually inaccurate. It's been pointed out that changing the scoring
<br>system as you suggest increases the advantage of cheating.
<br>
<br>Now to throw something concrete into this. Freakonomics (Levitt and
<br>Dubner) quote numerous examples of cheating (teachers to name one
<br>less obvious example). But in particular they quote good statistical
<br>evidence that sumo wrestlers throw matches. This is precisely what
<br>you are arguing wouldn't happen in chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>While I didn't look at the original, there are some discussions
<br>I found publicly available. 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://faroutliers.blogspot.com/2005/05/freakonomics-of-sumo.html">http://faroutliers.blogspot.com/2005/05/freakonomics-of-sumo.html</a>
<br>which might give me some idea of what you are talking about.
<br>
<br>The argument in favor of corruption is not iron-clad, though definitely
<br>plausible. In any case, this has nothing to do with draw avoidance.
<br>
<br>There are vast differences between this situation and chess:
<br>1. The discussion appears to concern a simple special case of results when 
rewards are
<br>uneven for a single match - not a systematic, long-term cheating scheme.
<br>2. The rewards are far greater in sumo than in chess.
<br>3. Sumo has always been connected with unsavory elements - the closest
<br>thing in chess would have been Soviet government involvement,
<br>i.e. ancient history.
<br>
<br>Just about every sport, game, contest, etc. will produce isolated
<br>situations with unequal stakes. That those can be manipulated,
<br>and probably have been manipulated to some degree, to my
<br>way of thinking is scarcely relevant to the contention that
<br>converting chess to a rational scoring system will produce a
<br>wave of cheating.
<br>
<br>A while ago, Anand with White clinched first place at Linares
<br>by playing a quick draw with a lower rated opponent who was out of
<br>the running.&nbsp; That was run of the mill chess. Everybody likes
<br>Anand, and he was doing what everybody does. The lower rated
<br>player gained a few points, and exceeded his expectation. Anand
<br>clinched an important tournament victory. It was a sensible deal.
<br>But I hope I'm not alone in thinking that it would have been
<br>more interesting to see a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>real<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> chess game, whatever
<br>scoring/anti-cheating measures are needed to produce it.
<br>Counting draws as half wins produces <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>pseudo<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> chess.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Given we already have
<br><blockquote type=cite>evidence (agreed draws) that chess players aren't moral paragons
<br>(and I think Bobby Fischer blew that one too) there's a near certainty
<br>they'd be doing something similar. (Maybe the coin toss, or they
<br>could auction the game throw between them in advance, with an
<br>agreed signal when it's invoked by mutual agreement. That solves
<br>most of the problems you raise, even though a simple coin toss is
<br>mostly good enough.)
<br>
<br>And to return to Fischer. When he was on top, most of his
<br>opponents were Soviet grandmasters. It's well recorded that the
<br>USSR authorities would instruct players what to do. With a net
<br>gain from throwing games, they would have been laughing all the
<br>way.
<br>
<br>And finally, what's the problem with draws? Apart from that draws
<br>can be instructive and interesting, let's just suppose they aren't,
<br>and that 80% of games are draws (I think it's slightly less than
<br>that). So only 20% of games are interesting. Who has time to
<br>watch even that 20%? The only people who'd have to watch draws
<br>are people watching a single game, live. And we can pretty much
<br>assume those people are chess enthusiasts, and they clearly
<br>don't mind draws.
