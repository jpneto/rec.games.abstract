SUSAN is a game of my own design with extremely simple rules and
considerable depth of play. The rules are as follows:

 around it - _a stone may be surrounded by any combination of your
 stones, your opponent's stones and the edge of the board_. But be
 careful; if one of your stones is surrounded on your own turn
 (even if you surround one of your opponent's stones at the same
 time), you lose the game!....
The second half of the second to last sentence confuses some
people, so I include diagrams to explain it when I print the rules
on paper....

could you say that this is the reverse of Go?  in Go you kill first,
then breath, as for example in a ko.  so in SUSAN you try to breath
first, then kill.  thus, if you cant breath, you die before you kill?
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

... The key point is that the game ends as soon as ANY stone
has no empty spaces around it. Neighboring stones of your own are
just as much of a threat as your opponent's stones. Every stone is
both a benefit and a liability.
The most significant weakness that I am aware of is that it is
possible to get into a draw situation.

how can this happen?  there a finite number (61) of places to go - oh,
okay, the sliding option could lead to repeated positions - just
disallow repeated positions...the 4-6 consecutive slides idea just
sounds messy.

SUSAN is currently available by modem from the Dragon's Eye BBS at
(512) 343-7727.
A Macintosh version is available by ftp from
sumex-aim.stanford.edu
The Mac version 2.0 has an opponent intelligence that uses neural-
net techniques, and learns by playing.

hey, this is great.  hope the learning goes well.

sounds like a nice game.  how did you come up with SUSAN?  is it an
acronym?  the end of a bad relationship?  :-)

 got a question here...if i tell somebody else about this game and we play
 it on one my hexgrid boards (i seem to have all these remnants of games
 lying around from failed ideas), is that ok?  as long as i dont make any
 money or let anyone else make money off this?  what's the official word
 on copyrighted games?  i'd like to know, because i have a copyrighted
 game myself.  i know you cant copyright an idea.  you also got a trade-
 mark.  i think the sad thing for us game designer types is that we need
 all 3 things - copyright, trademark and patent.  the last is expensive.
