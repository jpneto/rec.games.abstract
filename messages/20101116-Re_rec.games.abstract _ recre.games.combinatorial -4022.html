Recently I posted at r.g.c about why I left: It has the atmosphere of
a dog pack that has been upset by a couple of stray wolves and one or
two got bitten.
Now they've retreated to a safe place and are all excited to get back
at them.

And a very mature engagement it has been: depicting Mark as a

I don't think rga is ever going to be clean - steere will haunt it for
ever, checking in once in a while to make sure nothing gets past him.
That guy is one sad cookie!

We, we, we, oh cosiness, oh resentfulness, oh [cowardice].
Why please does this place need to be "completely deserted" to start
the polite exchange of ideas you aspire to. And even if, isn't
ignoring it the best way?

Okay Christian I guess you're officially releasing Steere rants in
"polite" now? K, just checking. There's a very good reason why this
place needs to deserted. It's bad enough that Steere will never get
the idea but the more people who post their games and game-related
musings here, the more pointless this exercise becomes. Eventually
everyone is just posting on two sites, making it harder to find
everything. Okay, that's not a revolution, that's just a waste of my
time (I know lol). Now you're going to post your next lovely design
here and Nick Bentley will pop in to give you the old thumbs up. So
while my postings in this forum are belligerent and immature, that's
kind of the point. Who the fuck is going to stop me? I'm pretty much
making the problem as clear as possible for everyone. There's no
quality control here. This isn't a forum for abstract games, Steere
made that abundantly clear. It's also a forum to talk about whatever
the fuck you want. Okay let's talk about whatever the fuck here but
let's keep the abstract games material on the forum with an atmosphere
that everyone, could at the very least, stomach if not thrive in. And
it's not like Mark is banished from the site as he says, I just know
he wouldn't accept an invitation. He seems to see nothing wrong with a
technical abstract games forum that includes accounts of Ralf Gering's
internet activity. Probably because he's the one posting that nonsense
in the first place. Nick Bentley told me in passing that Mark scared
the userbase off and I believed him, so that's how the ball got
rolling but unfortunately I can't say that the upshot of moving
everyone over to the new forum has been the steep rise in activity I
was expecting. All we got so far, besides the contest of course is
Bill Taylor's Y with Christmas decorations. I'm not saying it has been
fruitless, it beats the heck out of Tidbits. I'm just saying it hasn't
lived up to my romantic preconceptions of what it would be.
