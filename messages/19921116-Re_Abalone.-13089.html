I've never played Go (though I have a general idea of the game rules).
Could you give an example of the "ko" rule?

Sure. Firstly, the main capture rule in Go is that if you surround a stone
or army (filling all of its "liberties"), you capture it. Now, consider this
situation: (x: black, o: white, .: empty)


                    . . . . . . . .
                    . . . x o . . .
                    . . x o . o . .
                    . . . x o . . .
                    . . . . . . . .
                    Black to move.

Suppose that black plays in the "hole" formed by the white stones. That leaves
this position:
                    . . . . . . . .
                    . . . x o . . .
                    . . x . x o . .
                    . . . x o . . .
                    . . . . . . . .
                    White to move.

If white were now to play in the same place his captured stone was, we'd be
left with the same situation above. This could go on forever, so the ko rule
states than a move which exactly recreates a previous position is illegal.
White must play somewhere else. After white's play, black can then fill in
the "hole" himself, or play elsewhere, leaving white free to retake.

If the above situation were part of a critical position, and the player able
to fill the hole would gain a substantial advantage, we'd have what is called
a ko fight. After black's initial capture, white must play elsewhere... and if
he wants to win the ko fight, he'll make a play that constitutes so great
a threat to black that black must respond. (This is known as a "ko threat").
After black responds, white can retake... and then black must find a ko
threat of his own. When one player runs out of ko threats, the other will
fill the ko and win the ko fight.
