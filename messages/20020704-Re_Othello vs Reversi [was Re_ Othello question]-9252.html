As I thought I understood it until now, the only difference between Othello
and Reveri was the opening position (though apparently there are other
important differences). Also, I understand that the Othello starting
position, when considered as an opening in Reversi, is a bad opening for the
first player. But the first player is still considered to have the advantage
in Othello.

Therefore, it would seem to me that Othello is an improvement on Reversi,
though perhaps a subtle one, since the opening gives a more balanced game.

This is my first post to this (or any) newsgroup, so please let me know if I
didn't do it right ...
