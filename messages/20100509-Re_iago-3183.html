I don't understand why you find it offensive to consider Batik an
abstract game? It seems to me that it is effectively a combinatorial
game (I have only read the rules and I am presuming it is predictable
where the piece will fall).

You're "presuming it is predictable where the piece will fall"?  Are
you looking at the same picture I am??

Is your

An abstract game is never a game of physical dexterity.  Batik is
precluded on that basis alone.  Even if you were allowed to lower the
pieces into position, Batik would <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>still<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> not be an abstract game.

Hippos and Crocodiles is an abstract game that involves visual
dexterity.

Said variant of Batik, on the other hand, is just a game of visual
dexterity.  Batik is a contest of visually estimating precise
distances - something that would not favor the visually impaired.

Think of an abstract game as something that would never disadvantage a
person based on physical, including visual, limitations.  It's
something for your mind - only.  The board and pieces are just tools
to help you visualize the state of the game - not something you should
have to grapple with.

Why is it offensive that Richard Hutnik, president of the
International Abstract Games Organization, calls Batik an abstract
game?  When people see my Abstract Games table, I want them to think,
"Cool, abstract games."  I don't want them to think, "Oh, great.
Shitty games of physical and visual dexterity.  That's what the
president of the International Abstract Games Organization says.  No
thanks."

You want to see some real abstract games?  Look here:

If Batik qualified as an abstract game, lawn darts would also have to
qualify.  Everything would have to qualify.  Why is lawn darts
different from Batik?  Because it's bigger and it's played outside?

Richard Hutnik has imposed himself as some sort of abstract games
"representative".  And now the forums are spammed to capacity with
Hutnik's relentless campaign to fuck up abstract games.  Go, a
WAY!!!!!

Why would someone who claims to promote abstract games portray them as
something to be "dumped" somewhere?  Does that sound "promotional" to
you?  Oh boy, let me run out and get this dumped thing.
