SBdDbC stands for:

    Single Board, Double Chess

You need a single chess board, two sets
of chess pieces and 32 checkers.

The initial position is like in chess
except that each piece stands on
a checker, signifying the fact that
initially each piece is double.

Now 1.e2-e4 amounts to removing the checker
from under e2 pawn, and setting a new pawn
on e4. Now white has single pawns on e2
and on e4.

Or 1.Ng1-f3 amounts to removing the checker
from under g1 knight, and setting a new knight
on f3. Now white has single knight on g1
and on f3.

You always move single pieces.

You can make only a single short castling
and/or a single long castling (always with single
pieces, even if king or the repsective rook
are doble -- thus castling would undouble them).

In the middle of the game, when you
capture on a square then you capture
whatever and everything which is on
that square.

You may move your piece to a square
occupied by your single piece (never double)
but only when the two pieces are alike, thus
creating a double piece.

You win by checkmating one of your
opponent's king or the double king, e.g.
the fool mate works as always:

1.e4 e5
2.Bc4 Nc6
3.Qh5 Nf3
4.Qxf7 mate

However white still has a single queen
on d1, a single bishop on c1, a single
pawn on e2, while black has a single pawn
on e7, and single knights on g8 and b8.

Enjoy.

Best regards,

    Wlod
(single or double).
