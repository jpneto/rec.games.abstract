 I honestly don't think it'd have much affect.

 If white played 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.c4 or 1.Nf3 black would always swap. If
he played anything else, black probably wouldn't.

 It doesn't add much variety to the game, since most players see 1.d4
and 1.e4 regularly, and ALMOST anything else can be transposed into a
1.d4 opening. (Yes, there are a few exceptions, so people will spend
more time learning 1.c4 e5, but beyond that...)

 So one-move equalization doesn't work too well.

 On the other hand, three-move equalization will balance out the win
rate, but at the cost of increasing the number of draws. Everyone, as
white, will steer for a position where black acheives equality quickly,
(This is not obvious with three moves, but if you were to hypothesize,
say, five, it's much clearer. The principle is the same, however) since
that's the only way to insure that you aren't at a disadvantage.

 The result would be people playing from equal positions, which means
less incentive to push for a win, which means more draws.

Not all even positions are equally drawish. 1.g4 b5 2.f4, for instance, may
be equal, but would likely lead to a lack of king-safety for both players.
