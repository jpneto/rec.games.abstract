i was thinking about the protection game inventors have to get and
the dangers of publishing a game in this news group.  then i thought
that we may be able to setup a Registration List here that would at
least provide some rudimentary protection.  the key idea is the date
of publication.  you can get a copyright easy because they do not
check to see if its been copyrighted before.  the burden of proof in
a copyright case is to establish the first date of publication.  by
getting a copyright with the U.S. Library of Congress you get a
bullet-proof date of publication.

a patent - on the other hand - does require a search, and the system
is heavily rigged so that you have to hire a patent attorney.  this
is much costlier in both time and money.

take for example Rubik's cube.  this was also invented in Japan? at
about the same time, although it was (maybe still is) hard to see
who was first.  another issue is Golomb's "pentominoe" trademark.
does that mean that any new game using them has to fork over some
kind of royalty?  yuck.  we can call them "pentasquares" then and
declare that term to be in the public domain.

what do others in this group think about some kind of Registration?
we could establish an archive somewhere for Registered games.

then again we could be flooded with zillions of trivial or overly
ornate games that would swamp the process and effectively render it
useless.

just wondering....
