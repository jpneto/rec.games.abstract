I recently bought a game called Celtic Chess, though I had read about
it under a different name: "tablut", where it was said to be a game
from Laponia (my translation of the French word "Laponie", which is in
the northern part of Finland, I think). I have some problems with
understanding the rules, namely the rules for capture. Has anyone got
information?

The board is 7x7, there are two players. White has got 9 pawns: 1
chieftain &amp; 8 warriors, black has got 12 warriors. The starting
position is as follows:

	*.bbb.*
	.......
	b.www.b
	b.wcw.b
	b.www.b
	.......
	*.bbb.*

White is dubbed as "the chieftain", black is "the attackers". The
warriors move like chess rooks. The chieftain moves the same way but
only one square until he has reached one of the edges of the board. He
may then move like a warrior, but only along the edge. No warrior may
stop on the corner square, they cannot stop on the the center square
but may pass through it.

The chieftain's goal is to reach one of the corners. The attackers'
goal is to capture the chief by circling him with 4 warriors
(horizontally &amp; vertically), or with 3 if the chieftain is along the
edge.

To capture a warrior, the opponent must put 2 warriors on the sides of
the former. If a warrior is aside a corner square, it counts as an
opposite warrior. What is imprecise with the rules is whether the 2
warriors should be at the opposite of the captured warrior (i.e. the
three form a line), or if the fact that any 2 warriors aside an
opponent suffice to capture the latter.

Note that a warrior can willingly go into a "taken" position without
being captured.

Good play and thanks for help.
