Just for the record, the idea behind Query was already mentioned in
2008 by some guy called Torben Ægidius Mortensen, before you
independently invented it. It was here:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamesforum.ca/archive/index.php/t-339451.html">http://www.gamesforum.ca/archive/index.php/t-339451.html</a>

I quote:

1. Use a checker board. Only black-to-black corners connect
(regardless of who plays them). This makes black squares more
valuable than white squares, but this is symmetrical for both
players. This topologically equivalent to a square/octagon grid,
but avoids plays on corners.

Speaking of which, I thought of an improvement on it a while ago. Here
it goes:

Black starts making one step. From then on, every turn is made of two
steps. A step consists of performing one of the following actions:

a) Placing a stone of your color on an empty White square.
b) Moving a stone of your color from a White square to a Black square.

You must make at least one step on every turn. As before, two like-
colored stones are considered to be connected if they occupy
orthogonally adjacent squares or diagonally adjacent <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>black<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> squares.
Winning condition as usual.

I named it Quaxtep, as horrible a name as any.

This game is more flexible than Christian &amp; Torben's (and probably
many others') idea. In fact, it's a generalization of it, with one
exception: in my game, if you occupy all White (c4) squares
surrounding a Black (c8) square, your opponent can't play on that
square.

Needless to say, since all squares are legal placements to at least
one of the players, this game is still drawless. Also, White squares
aren't "discriminated" anymore, as you must necessarily play on them
before moving to black squares.
