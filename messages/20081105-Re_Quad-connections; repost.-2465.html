Actually, google didn't mess up your pix at all. It posted them
verbatim, and those with sane newsreaders can and do display them 
as you intended. While through obnoxious and deceitful behaviour,
they do attempt to stuff up perfectly good old Usenet (they 
rewrite quotes, so that they're no longer verbatim quotes), this
isn't such a case.

The fact that google <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>displays<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the posts in a fucked up way is
an entirely separate issue. Some newsgroups have now been given 
special dispensation by the doofera at google so that their group 
will by default be displayed in monospace. How they achieved that,
I have no idea. But if you continue to use a fundamentally flawed 
way of accessing usenet, you might want to investigate further.

And you right royally fucked that up too. Your original was
fine.

Just don't use google groups. Google groups sucks.
