Hi,
I'd like to introduce my new stacking game "Mixtour".

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://spielstein.com/games/mixtour">http://spielstein.com/games/mixtour</a>

This is my entry for the Stacking Games Contest on rec.games.abstract.
Many thanks to Daniel Shultz for initiating this contest. Actually,
Mixtour includes a mechanism which is reminiscent of his game
Charisma.

Working on this game was quite exhausting but also very satisfying. I
hope you like it.

Hi Dieter,

I have a couple of questions regarding the rules:

- "Generally, discs move orthogonally or diagonally in straight
lines."

I have found no instance where stacks moved otherwise, so why the
"Generally"?

- "Players try to build stacks, at least 5 discs high, with a disc of
their own color on top."

Since such a stak is removed on completion, the last move of the
player must have been with a stack with his own color on top. "Of
course" I hear you say. "players move only stacks with their color on
top".
Right. But then what about this?:

- "Discs are always taken from the top of a stack. Stacks may be split
at any level. Remaining discs stay behind. Players may move discs of
any(!) color."

The last sentence is confusing. If stacks may be split at any level,
then implicitly discs of the opponent may be moved. Mentioning it
explicitly, even with an exclamation mark, suggests that players may
move stacks of the opponent.

Apart from these remarks, you've made an elegant game on a mechanism
that also crossed my mind in the beginning: Daniel's Charisma applied
to stacks rather than groups. Note also that your entering procedure
is the same as Trounce's: entering or moving in the same phase of a
game. This is an undervalued procedure, although it is older than
Methusalem, as testified by Nine Men's Morris.

The exhausting part of the process was probably related to the object.
I couldn't find one fitting the mechanism and diverted to elimination
and the Focus/Explosion mechanism. There's a smell of the arbitrary
surrounding Mixtour's object, although the mechanism connects
boardsize to stack height in a clever way to remove it for a large
part. But not entirely: "Generally, 5 points are needed to win a game
(5 is the number of Mixtour), but players can agree upon any other
number at the beginning of the game."

Finally, my compliments for the presentation!
