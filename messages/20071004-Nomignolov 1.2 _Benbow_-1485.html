Hello to all!

at
nomignolov.blogspot.com
you can download the last version "Benbow" of my universal program for
abstract games. It's a free program for Windows, and an hobby
project. I hope that that saves my message from being qualified as
spam!

The biggest change is the ability to play and chat via internet with a
client/server architecture! I can't say that this is tested a lot, but
it seems to work! :-)

I made some improvements to the graphics (new GUI controls, some
redesign,...) and a lot of minor reviews.

I included the new game Sicic (nomignolov.blogspot.com/sicic), so the
complete list of scripted games/puzzles is:
Dao, Entropy, Conway's Soldiers, Wari, Tic-tac-toe, Diffision, 14-15,
3verse, Hex, Tablut, 8 Queens, Knight's tour, Magic square (4x4),
Sicic.

That's 14! You can add more games with a Lua script (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.lua.org">www.lua.org</a>), as
I explain in the documentation.

Have a good day!
Bye, Jean
