Daniel, you haven't really been too involved with the group, so you probably
haven't noticed that Bill Taylor has been on a complete fucking rampage for
the past three months.  The frequency of his posts have decreased, but
they're still completely peppered with exclamation marks, spewing venom
about Mark the Destroyer.

Now everyone's conveniently pretending they haven't noticed Bill Taylor's
Geringesque, permanent meltdown.  We have a charade where Bill Taylor isn't
expected pounce on a golden opportunity to fuck me over.

"Internet contest" to me connotes something like yahoo or bgg, or something
a little more grandiose in scale.  Rec.games.abstract is a small group and
here's what we accomplish by opening the contest to all voters.

10 votes from contest entrants.
20 votes from unbiased voters
200 votes from Bill Taylor using various sockpuppets

This isn't a "conspiracy".  This isn't paranoia.  This is a given.

Group response: "Oh no, Mark.  You're no more subject to the whims of the
votership than any of us.  There's nothing to worry about.  Bill Taylor
won't do anything.  We need the voters."

Fuck off.  Everyone stands to gain from this shit except me.  Sure, there's
nothing for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to worry about.  Quite the opposite.  There's less for you
to worry about with Monkey Queen in the way.

You want to know what the fucking fuss is, Daniel?  I'm not going to enter a
bogus contest rigged to make my game come in dead last.

Get some integrity, people.  "Oh I won this contest where Mark Steere's
excellent game inexplicably came in dead last."

On this point you're correct.  I almost certainly never would have designed
Monkey Queen if not for the contest.  And MQ wouldn't have been improved to
its present form without the contest.
