Three-on-a-row in a 3^x space is rather easy to prove things about. That game
has (as far as playing something on a sheet of paper during lessons) long
been dead for me. 4-on-a-row in 2-d space is a bit more fun, but I seem to
have proved the the starter wins. How about 5-on-a-row? How about 3-player
4-on-a-row? Has anyone tried to prove who wins there?

Simple proof that any sort of tic-tac-toe game is either a draw or a win
for the first player:

Suppose that the game is a win for the second player. Then there is some
strategy that the second player can follow that will guarantee him a win.
Now, in tic-tac-toe, there is NO disadvantage whatsoever to having an
extra square with your mark in it. So the first player can guarantee himself
a win by making his first move off in a corner somewhere, and from then on,
playing as if he were the second player. (If ever the strategy calls for him
to play in the place he made his first move, he can just make another
extraneous move elsewhere). Therefore, if there is a guaranteed win for
the second player, there is a guaranteed win for the first player. This is
a contradiction, so there is NO WAY you can devise a tic-tac-toe game
where the second player can win.

This proof works for ANY game where an extra move is no disadvantage (Hex,
Bridg-It, and so forth.) It does NOT work for a game like chess, where an
extraneous move is not a clear advantage. Note that it doesn't tell you
whether the game is drawn or whether it's a first-player win. If the game
cannot possibly be drawn (like Hex), it only tells you that the first-player
win exists, it does not tell you how to find it.
