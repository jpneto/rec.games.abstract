Mark mentions some variants that can be played using a Bridgit board and
pieces, and speculates that one-move equalization would not save the
standard game. He is right. Bridgit is a special case of the more general
Shannon edge switching game. A simple methodology has been discovered for
finding the winning move in any winning position in this game. This is
discussed in "Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays" (I forget which
volume, sorry.) At any rate, even with three-move equalization, the
methodology would still apply, and the game is not interesting. This

As I know David knows, Bridgit may be solved in the sense we're talking
about, and may also be a special case of Shannon, but it is not Shannon
itself has not been so solved. Hex, at which David excels but does on rare
occasion lose, is also a special case of Shannon.
