I've just created a BGG entry for Loose:

You'll notice that I've switched from the pie rule to komi. I think
komi is just about as elegant or inelegant as the pie rule, but maybe
komi is slightly preferable because it lets players play optimally
right from the start.

Furthermore, Go players don't seem to like the pie rule very much:

One of the reasons they give is that, Go being a game where so many
equally sound playing styles are possible, the first player can make
an objectively advantageous first move which suits his style but not
his opponent's, so that the latter won't feel at ease with it if he
swaps, and will be in an inferior position if he doesn't. In either
case, he is at a disadvantage. This is probably not a definitive
reason not to use the pie rule, but komi doesn't have this problem
(it's more aseptic, so to speak), and it feels natural enough to me.

The one thing that I don't like is fixed komi, since the appropriate
komi is different for differently skilled players, so I've chosen a
protocol in which the first player sets the komi and the second player
chooses which side to play. Very pie-rule-like, if you want...
