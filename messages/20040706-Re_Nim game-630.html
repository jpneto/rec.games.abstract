A) A number of pieces (all of the same color) are placed on a NxM
board. No field contains more than one piece (one might relax this
condition, but I don't believe it adds more 'depth' to the game). Two
players in turn make a move which consists of taking one or more
pieces from the board. Pieces taken in each move should come from the
same horizontal or vertical row. The player who made the last move
wins.

B) The same game as A), but now one player is restricted to moves
removing pieces from a horizontal row, and the other player is
restricted to removing pieces from a vertical row.

My questions:
1) do such games already exist?
2) can one define a general strategy for these games? I.e. using
concepts like Nim-sums, can one determine whether or not an arbitrary
position on a large board is a P-position?

A fundamental theorem of combinatorial game theory states that all
impartial or non-partisan games (i.e., games where there are no moves
which are reserved to a particular player) are equivalent to nim.  So,
for game A it certainly is the case that a general strategy exists.
Finding the strategy (i.e., computing the nim-values of each of the
states) might be a chore, since there are so many legal moves from each
position and there's no simple chart-like way to tabulate all of the
positions, but it certainly exists.

Game B is a partisan game, because only certain players are allowed to
make certain moves.  The theory for partisan games is much more
complicated, but this game should be interesting to analyze because it
contains "hot" positions where both players would like to be the next
one to move instead of allowing the other player to go first.
