I don't think the developer went out of his way to make a crappy
adaption of Arimaa to Zillions.  I think he likely just ported it into
Zillions ot get publicity.  It is quite possible that, as the
developer indicated, Zillions doesn't handle the game well.  I think
this is likely the case.  Other games ZIllions doesn't handle well to.

    I don't think he did, either, and I hope that wasn't what you thought I
was saying.  I also sincerely doubt that he did it for publicity--I think if
I were him I'd take any engine such as Zillions and start coding for it out
of pure intellectual curiosity, if nothing else.  I don't ascribe any "evil"
motives here, I just think that the folks who wrote Zillions are the likely
best implementers of the games rules that it runs, because they are fully
conversant with the capabilities of the engine.
    I don't think Mr. Syed can be that conversant, without full access to
the engine source, and if he is, I'm happy to be wrong.  I for one can
attest the the ease with which rules are implemented in Zillions for a very
large class of boardgame activity, and I'm equally comfortable listing
difficulty I perceive with a large number of other boardgame activities.
Zillions is a general purpose engine, and I think it's fantastic, but I
think that, for example, it's not immediately obvious how to implement a
very large number of things.  At least not to those people who didn't design
it....and I'd like those people to take the challenge of coding rules for
Arimaa that, in conjunction with their engine, play a wicked game of it!
I'd LOVE for Zillions to win the 10 grand, and I bet they wouldn't shrug it
off, either.  I know they readily took my much smaller chunk of change way
back when when I registered their product....

    Even if it meant adding or modifying Zillions itself to handle specific
processes in a faster or more efficient manner, I'd have thought it a
challenge they'd welcome, for THEIR own publicity.

    With regard to the idea the Zillions can't handle the game well:  Sure,
I have no idea; I'm not involved in the field of AI--but I do know a bit
about expert systems, and if a system can handle enough rules, and those
rules can be specified with ENOUGH expertise, then a system should be able
to play Arimaa at least competently.  I love that Mr. Syed's ZRF comments
are accessible, human, and humorous.  I love playing with Zillions.  I think
that there's room for both sides of the AI v. Arimaa challenge to profit at
least intellectually, if not financially.  Personally, I would stake my
money on the AI, but more because I feel that challenges are what expand a
field, not stagnate it.  Of course I probably would have backed Harvard on
the pregnant man thing....
