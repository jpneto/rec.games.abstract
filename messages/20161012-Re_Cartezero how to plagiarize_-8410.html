No Hazen, I don't want you to die anytime soon. Like the other life cultists, I would rather have your cycle of addiction carry on into perpetuity until you all realize what the only viable teleology for humanity is. As for me; I plan to do the sensible thing and commit suicide just as soon as I can subvert the implacable Will to Live so that I no longer have to put up with gibbering idiots like yourself for decades to come or witness the fallout of a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton regime. Besides that, before I go I'll release my backlog of games which would be a far more legitimate legacy than trying to make excuses for the perpetuation of my genetic material through the imposition of sentience on my replacement shitters and the attendant mundane horrors of human experience.
