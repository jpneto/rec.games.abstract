Does anyone know the origin of Dou Shou Qi or Animal Chess (sometimes called
Jungle Chess)?
I would also be interested in hearing from those who may have played the
game as a child what order they remember the animals came in (e.g. Elephant
beats Lion beats ...  ... Cat beats Mouse).
Any information would be appreciated.
Regards,
Keng Ho

The earliest description that was published in the West was in R.C.
Bell's well-known 'Board and table games from many civilizations', I,
1960 (rev. ed., p. 69-70), as "The Jungle Game". Bell said he had
received the game from Mr. A.P. Mohideen "who sent this game to me
from Hong Kong".
Waddington published their "home" version as "Jungle King" in 1963,
followed by their French ally Miro Company ("Le Roi de la jungle"
©1963). Both version differ from Bell's account in placing the wolf
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>over<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the dog (whereas in Bell's rules the dog is higher than the
wolf).

I've picked this some time ago in the Internet:

 From Ralf Gering :
His [Bodlaender's] description of Shou Dou Qi [sic] is based on E.
Glonnegger's Das Spielebuch and R.C. Bell's Board and Table Games from
many Civilizations. Both authors are extremely unreliable and their
books should, if possible, NOT be used as the only source of a game. I
used the following source:
Rainer Schmidt, Das spielt das Volk in China. Frankfurt am Main, China
Studien- und Verlagsgesellschaft, 1981. (Rainer Schmidt was the
founder and the first president of the German Xiang Qi Association.)
Schmidt's rules of Shou Dou Qi [sic] were reviewed by Professor Dr. Yu
Chen-Lie before publication. For that reason alone my source can be
considered sufficiently reliable.

Hope this help.
