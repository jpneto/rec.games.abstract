There are already a number of ways of resolving this problem...

Haphazard chain reaction mechanism.  Automatically generates multiple
moves per turn.  Dismissed.

Crossway style: the 4th point may not be filled, and diagonal
connections automatically count.

Oh, that's right.  Your game depends on my game, Crossway, as the only
reasonable way to resolve your game's little problem.

Quax style:  diagonal lines connecting opposite points

Multi move type game that requires the balancing of little, colored
toothpicks on top of the stones.  Dismissed.

Swapway style(not public as yet): when a cross-cut square
                  is formed, a player may swap two stones so as
                  to make it parallel colors.  This might be done
   (i) by the player moving,  (seems to be bad); or
   (ii) by the next player to move, before his move, (better);
  (iii) by either player, but takes up a whole turn, (not tried).

Wow.  You've really outdone yourself with the "switcheroo".  I'll bet
you could come up with something even more cumbersome if you really
put your mind to it.  Dismissed.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Doubtless there are other ways of dealing with cross-cuts,
that we have not considered yet

Dismissed.
