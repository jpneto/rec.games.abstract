Yes, I have played this game.It is really excellent,providing a relatively
fun and painless way to learn and visualise some very hard logic-I credit
this game (and my hard work and intelligence)with allowing me to do well in
several classes and endeavours.I cannot really understand why no computer
version of this game was ever done,although I suppose it could be because
several of the games require quick"action"type responses.On the down side,
the instruction book is larger than many paperback novels,and contains 
numerous different variations and games to be used with the basic set of
pieces.Part of it is a discussion of various logics,but the bottom line
is that it is far too meaty to transfer a useful portion in an Internet
post.I highly recommend the game,but I fear you will need to obtain a rule
book to go with your game set.If you have specific questions,I may be 
able to dig out my old set.My current set of friends has rather less interest
in matters of logic than those of my college days,and my game set has gotten
buried beneath the layers of books and subsequent acquisitions.
