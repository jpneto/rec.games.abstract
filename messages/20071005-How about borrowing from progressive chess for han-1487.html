Rather than the idea of removing pieces as balancing, how about the
following levels of handicapping (greater handicap):
* First, have the weaker player choose white or black.
* Allow the weaker player a chance to score points on a draw, but the
stronger player doesn't.
* Allow the weaker player to play white, and get two non-capture moves
to start before their opponent gets a move.
* Three non-capture moves at start of game.
* Four non-capture moves at start of game.

And so on.  Can go up to maybe 6 or 7.  The moves can't have the
player capturing any pieces of an opponent.  You could also restrict
the moves a player's own half of the board.  In other words, for
handicapping, borrow from progressive chess.
