<br>It seems to me that the first player has an easy win by simply playing all
<br>moves on her opponents home intersections.
<br>
<br>In theory, it might be possible for the second player to force a win before
<br>this happens.&nbsp; In practice, however, it seems quite easy for the first
<br>player to see this coming and concentrate her moves on the right area of her
<br>opponents home intersections to foil any such plan.
<br>
<br>I've only played a couple of 9*9 games against myself, though, so maybe I'm
<br>missing some key strategic concepts!&nbsp; (Or maybe the character of the game
<br>changes on larger boards, although I would think the above strategy would
<br>work even better as the board gets larger...?)

<br>While you're working on the 14 squares marked X:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; X...*...X
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; X.......X
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>
<br>I'll work on the 9 squares marked Y:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; ....YYYY.
<br>&nbsp; ...Y*....
<br>&nbsp; ....YYYY.
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>&nbsp; .........
<br>
<br>Disrupting this is surely possible, but I suspect it isn't as
<br>easy as you make it out to be.
