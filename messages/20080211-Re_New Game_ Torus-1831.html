 So sure am I that not only is Torus an unequal-goal game,
(which is now obvious to everyone except Mark),
that in fact I strongly suspect that even on a 4x4
it is an easy win to NS, EVEN WHEN EW starts!

(It is clear that for large boards NS has such an overwhelming
advantage due to the topology, that EW can win against the start,
on sufficiently large boards.)

Thus I put out a general challenge to support my view.

I challenge all comers to take EW against me, and have first move.
All opening moves are equivalent, so I play my second...

Anyone who wants to, just make yr move on the board,
and "reply" accordingly.  May as well leave them here on the group.
