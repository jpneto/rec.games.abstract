I think pie by itself should be sufficient.  It's a big board and there should be initial moves that are worth very close to 1/2 turn - say between .48 and .52 of a turn.  What advantage that .02 turn confers to player 2 would be a function of skill, but even top players are so far from perfect, I believe, that the tiny initial advantage wouldn't have a chance to snowball into anything significant. 

It'll be interesting to see the stats for expert games in which players know when to use pie - whenever the hell someone programs Redstone.  Apparently there's a premium on quantity of games over quality.  Sure there are bragging rights for having the most games.  But when most of them suck, it seems like a hollow victory.
