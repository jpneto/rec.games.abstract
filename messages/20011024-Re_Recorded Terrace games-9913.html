: &gt;I recently purchased a used copy of the board game Terrace (the old 8x8
: &gt;version) and I'm looking for some recorded games, preferably by strong
: &gt;players, so I can get a feel for the game.  

: Richard's Play-by-E-Mail server, <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/</a> , offers
: Terrace. I think you can use its show and subscribe commands to get 
: transcripts of in-progress and recently-finished games.

: Northumbria has an archive of games played on Richard's server, 
: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://northumbria.tripod.com/pbemarchive.html">http://northumbria.tripod.com/pbemarchive.html</a> , but I didn't see 
: Terrace listed. I'm not sure why. They say they archive almost all of
: the games. Terrace might show up eventually.

  I think Northumbria only archives games without random dice and only then
  will they update the archives at each 50th game completed.  Maybe Terrace
  has not finished 50 games yet?  (my guess)  (I believe it has something to
  do with wanting to produce the most efficient zip file size before
  going through the process of compressing and archiving the games)
