"Taming The Slippery King

Page 116 Variant Chess 61 July 2009
Review by John Beasley, editor

A fundamental difficulty in multidimensional chess is that of confining and mating the king. Joe Joyce's fourdimensional Hyperchess [Joyce] uses a method which appears novel."

Nice.  

About 1/3 of my abstract games (excluding connection games) are inherently adaptable to any number of dimensions, without any modification to the rules, by virtue of their simplicity.  Monkey Queen is one.  You'd only need to specify board size and starting position.

Many are adaptable to other dimensions. That is obvious. What is hard is to find the optimal dimension. When I say optimal I mean to use one criterion : the playgame will be more or less interesting with k dimension? yes or no.
Some games are not interesting at all if you change the dimension. Worse than that some are unplayable in some dimensions.
The human player is not a machine or robot. 
There is an optimal number of choices to be made for the human players.
There is an optimal number of moves that a human being could handle. The more you multiply those levels the less the game will be playable except if the game is digitalized so the human brain will focus on creativity not on complex intricacies.
Do not forget that games are created for the average human not the geniuses.
Otherwise the game will be played only by 2 or 3 people.
Now there are some specific fields in mathematics that only 4 or 5 persons in THE WORLD could understand!!! 
4 dimensions?????????????????? why not 1000000 ???
It seems to me that some game designers are just trying to hide their incompetency behind UNSUSEFUL complexity.
An interesting abstract game is a game challenging an average human brain not a computer. At each step the player has to solve some sort of puzzle having a unique solution or few solutions reachable in short time of thinking.

In my case, I can barely play Chess in two dimensions. 3D would be a complete waste of my time. 4D? I'd be the functional equivalent of a twice baked potato."

So far, I've only designed games that I would like to play. I don't see that changing either. To me, it's an interesting game. But I agree that most people are scared off by "4D" - so when I designed a trading game I set in space, I never told the players it, too, was a 4D board. They enjoyed it, but it could run for a couple days, so it's back to the re-design stage.

I'm decent at chess, but have a lousy memory, so I appreciated the variants.. And that's why I do higher-end abstracts - it essentially eliminates the memory issues I have. I can honestly say I have the memory of a multiple stroke victim, based on my losing roughly half the memory games I play with the one person I know who had 3 strokes within a few hours... and that explains why I don't like "simple" abstracts - there's too much of a memory issue there for me. I've rarely gotten 6 turns ahead in chess, and generally only get a few moves ahead before I lose the whole thing.

The "hard" games I design are occasionally unable to be played by computer, or played well by computer, but are aimed at humans, who do beat me. The Command and Maneuver series is a good example of this. Computers don't yet play wargames well. People do. This is why I said in the war chess thread that I have not designed a much more difficult chess game, I've designed a "different" game. Agreed, not many play it now, and not many play chess variants. Fwiw, I gained some notoriety in the world of chess variants, but that only makes me obscurely famous, known by tens worldwide. 

Given the direction my designs have gone, I jumped from the tiny ghetto of chess variants to the somewhat larger ghetto of abstracts. And I haven't gained much traction here, either. So I'm going further, and designing non-abstracts, which are beginning to gain traction. Shoot 'Em Up Spaceships did quite well at Unpub 5 in Baltimore MD a month ago, and I'm working on that game now, as it actually does have commercial potential. However, That's only my second-best design. The Battle of Macysburg is my best design so far, and I'm trying to get a little traction for it, and the game system it's a part of. If I can't, I can't. C'est la vie. But because I'm neither a well-known nor published designer is pretty irrelevant to the kinds of games I design. I will always design games that I would like to play when I've designed them. I'm not looking for novelty, per se. I'm looking for good games that people will play and enjoy. And I'll go where my designs take me. Enjoy!
