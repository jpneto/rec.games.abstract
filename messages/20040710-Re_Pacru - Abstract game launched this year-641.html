If you are saying that the AI, the computer player, is weak, then I would
have to agree.    We are expecting many people interested in writing AI will
see the game and be attracted by the prospect of creating a sophisticated
opponent .. but it is early days for that, really.

If you are saying that the software that provides the interface for human
opponents is weak then that is of concern - it is still in its infancy (and
rapidly improving) but we think of it as already attractive and reasonably
easy to use.   What would the key changes be that you would like to see?

Hi,

Well, I've tried Pacru and played it several times, and I must say I think
its an excellent game. The game is surprisingly fluid and is really fun to
play. I do however find the software to be quite weak.

Good luck with developing this game, Mike!

Regards,
Alain Dekker
