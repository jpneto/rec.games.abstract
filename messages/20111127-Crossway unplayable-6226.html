I have spent some time trying to figure out how to play a game called
Crossway and came to the conclusion that it is unplayable. The reason
is that there are 8 directions in which a chain can be extended
(compared to 6 in Hex) and only one blocking mechanism in the form of
the X pattern. Unfortunately the mechanism is very weak: you need 2
stones to cut off just one diagonal direction, all the other ones
still being available. As a consequence it is almost impossible to
stop an advancing chain - a minimum of 7 empty lines are needed for
that. I have spent way too much time on this ill-designed game. Can I
have it back? I think that game designs should be treated as software
- without proper playtesting and accompanying examples of gameplay,
hints on tactics and strategy they should not be published. Another
rubbish game in Mr. Steer's collection is Rush. It is so pointless
though I am not going to waste any more time on it.
