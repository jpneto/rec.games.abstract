As far as judging criteria, I think originality and quality of play are a

Only that these judges presumably know what they're judging, and in
that case there's no need to point out the qualities that should be
taken into account explicitly.

Are all of the games programmed?  I think the programming links should be

Parquet is out, Splay, MQ and Grabber are programmed for Axiom and can
be freely downloaded from Greg's page:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html">http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html</a>

Here's a link there to Dieter's Mixtour:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://spielstein.com/games/mixtour">http://spielstein.com/games/mixtour</a>

Grabber can now be played (turnbased) at mindsports.nl, MQ will follow
shortly.

Stax, Twisties and Kasanari Shogi have no applets as far as I'm aware.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

When I first got the crazy idea to see how far I could get programming
the contest games, I soon realized that I would not be able to program
all of them.  I initially contacted Cameron Browne because I didn't
think I could tackle Stax and I wanted to know if he was planning on
creating an applet for the game.  It turns out that there won't be a
computer version of Stax and Cameron kindly mentioned that that
shouldn't stop me from doing the others.  Twisties has some unique
graphical complexities as well and so that dropped it down on the
list.  I spent quite a bit of effort on Parquet working with the
author trying to fix problems with the game to no avail and so now
that game is indefinitely on hold.  I was pleased to see that Dieter
created the Mixtour applet as that relieved the self-imposed pressure
of programming another game.

As Larry mentioned, I have made some good progress on Kasanari Shogi.
All in all, I have spent considerable time on these games.  This is
due to the following reasons:

1) A design can look great on paper, but once the game is played
against a serious opponent (e.g. a computer AI), that can easily
expose unforeseen flaws in the game and then it's back to the drawing
board.  Trying to program a game that's a moving target can make one
weary very quickly.

2) Developing computer games under a self-imposed schedule can be
grueling.  Under these conditions, my work tends to be more error
prone and things always take more time than I originally think they
will.  Sometimes unexpected problems can arise in areas that seem to
be conceptually simple.  That's the nature of the task.

3) As much as possible, I want to do the games justice.  I don't want
to put something out that will give a negative impression of the
game.  I'm trying to balance getting something out quickly with
getting something out that's of some threshold of quality so that
people can start playing the game and getting a feel for it.

I will continue working on the set of games that I have started and
bring them to completion.  I hope in the process, I haven't slighted
anyone's game, my goal is to help facilitate the contest by making as
many games as possible available.  Unfortunately, 100% coverage is not
possible, but I believe that in this case, something is better than
nothing.
