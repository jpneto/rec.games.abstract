Christian, a public vote would be a popularity contest slanted against me
and by extension my game.  I don't want to put words of ill intent into your
mouth, but your "general public with all its prejudice and likes and
dislikes" likes you more than it likes me, giving you and your game an
unfair advantage.  Does that just not matter to you?

I'm sure you don't want to win a contest slanted against Monkey Queen, yet
after the apparent group consensus that a judge panel would be the fairest
solution, you continue to press for a public vote slanted in your favor.  Is
the contest some glorified marketing stunt geared to "target an audience"? 
A goal so important that we have to subvert the contest in your favor?
