Can someone provide me with a brief description of any of the games
below? Most are abstracts, but not all. Also, does anyone know where
any of these may be purchased, other than ebay?

Agora (Tilsit)

I have the version by Pion d'OR (same): 16 Othello like squares
(Black/White)
and a 3 level 6x6 board (inner 2x2 level 0, middel 4x4 level 3, outer
6x6 level 6 - think a Pit ) Starting setup on opposite sides of the higherst
level

The aim of the game: to take the opponent's pieces. Each player takes
turns to move of of thier pieces in any direction, one square at a
time. If you have a stack you can only move the piece on the top of
the stack. There are three possible moves: moving to an empty square,
taking your opponent's piece or surrendering you piece.

How to take: If your piece is higher (see levels above) or at the
same height as your opponent's pieces you can capture (turn all
pieces to your color) So the top pices on a 5 high stack in the
middel 4x4 can capture a single piece next to in on the higher outer
level.

How to surrender: If you piece is lower or at the same height as you
opponent's pieces you can surrender it. The piece that surrenders is
slide under the opponents piece or stack without being turned over.
When the prisoners out number the captors the whole stack is turned
over to the surrenders color!

Winner it the only color left face up.
