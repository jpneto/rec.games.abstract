Suppose GONNECT (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gonnect.htm">http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gonnect.htm</a>) is
modified so that rather than winning by connecting EITHER pair of opposite
edges, instead, BLACK must connect the right and left edges while WHITE must
connect the top and bottom edges. As in HEX, there is no penalty for
connecting the wrong edges.

Is there a flaw in this version that I'm missing? If not, what are the
reasons to prefer the original rules? Is the original subjectively a better
game? Or is it just that the original goal is more aesthetically better,
more basic?

I've experimented on some very small boards and cannot find the flaw.

If there IS no flaw, I think the first person advantage is much less.
