Hello,

Gipf

is said to have simple rules, but this is only true for the basic rules
and could be called a marketing trick. Gipf played according to the
advanced "Tournament" rules is actually a chess variant (object is to
capture one or several pre-defined pieces), although quite an unusual one.

If gipf is a chess variant, then the earth is flat and the moon is made
of cheese....

Your comment is very primitive.

Gipf is totally original.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sorry, but nothing on this Earth is "totally original" (although this is
a common belief of cult members and Islamic fundamentalists). The game is
actually a rather wild mixture of different ideas which appeared in many
other games before. However, what is quite original is the way all
these elements were put together. You need much courage to invent such a
game.

Sorry, but I don't share your quasi-religious world-view of Gipf.
