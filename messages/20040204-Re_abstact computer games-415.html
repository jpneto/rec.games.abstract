"The starting position is so balanced that it is not known which side has
the theoretical advantage."

Note: Even saying "to the best of my knowledge that the starting position of
the game favors neither side more than the other" is wrong, unless you're
not as smart as you seem. It is necessarily true that the starting
position -- at least with perfect play, which is what you seem to be talking
about -- is a forced win for one side or the other. But your knowledge (and
everyone else's, at this point) can not reveal <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>which<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player has that
advantage.

"Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a
species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of
reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and
makes a crime out of things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a
blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded."
 - Abraham Lincoln, speech, 18 Dec 1840
