Another data point.

Arimaa World League play is underway as I write
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/mwiki/index.php/2010_Arimaa_World_League">http://www.arimaa.com/arimaa/mwiki/index.php/2010_Arimaa_World_League</a>

The games you can find there show a good range of skillful play from
medium level to expert level players.


What Significance so I ascribe to a zeroed out draw column?  Before I
answer that, let me be clear that the original question had to do with
this quote:

"We have seen occasional positions that tended toward stalemate and
piece shuffling...  I consider it unlikely that playing to win at
Arimaa will drive us toward such corners of the position space,"

The data I have shown earlier in this thread shows that draws have not
happened to this point in actual play.  this quote was taken out of
context from a theoretical discussion about the future of Arimaa.

Now, for the significance of the 3 time repetition rule.  This is only
my opinion based on my observation of hundreds of games.  I would
guess that around 1% of Arimaa games might lead to a draw if the 3
repeat rule was not in effect.  That is my opinion.  It is not a
fact.  I suggest that you view the games that I have provided links
to, and you can judge for yourself.



Finally, you have the right to continue referring to me as dumb ass,
stupid, lying, and the like.  However, I will not respond to any
further posts from you on any forum if your next post contains any of
those terms, or anything similar to them.

Have a nice day.
