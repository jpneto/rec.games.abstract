Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
One of my great finds at a used book store was "Scarne on Teeko" for a buck
and a quarter.  The book was published in 1955.  I had never heard of the
game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I got the book from a very kind American who wanted me to make me happy.
He didn't know me at all and didn't expect anything in return. Some
people are Saints.

As you note, it seems to have been very popular.  The last page of the book
discusses how "Teeko is Rapidly Sweeping the World".  What caused it to drop
in popularity?  Was some strategy discovered that rendered the game
uninteresting?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The game was "solved" a few years ago. It is a draw. However, this is only
true for Teeko played according to the basic rules. The advanced Teeko
rules described in our book "Scarne on Teeko" are much more complicated
and advanced Teeko is not yet solved. It's difficult to say  why fashions
fade. Salta was very popular in the 1900s, Camelot in the 1920s, Teeko in
the 1950s, TwixT in the 1970s.

Ralf
