In fact, this was not my suggestion. The idea was already hatched
some months before my posting in rec.games.chess. I was just merely
bringing up the idea for further discussion. Like it or not, this would soon be
approved by AXF in the AGM after the Xiangqi World Cup in Beijing in
May 1993. Also in store is a book on tactical jargons (Xiangqi) which
would soon be published.

I think for the mean time, we would use any notations we are more
comfortable with till further action by the AXF.


: There were some games in rec.games.chess, too, but I haven't seen any lately.
: I would be interested eg. in endgame lessons, problems etc.
I posted a game some months ago. Due to the lack of discussion
(interest?), I have stopped doing so. I do not know the standard of
Xiangqi in Finland, but there are several classic Xiangqi books on
endgame problems and openings published during the Ming/Qing dynasty
which are very suitable for beginners. Unfortunately, all the 
Xiangqi books are published in Chinese. There are many such books in
sale in Singapore, and if you like, I can get these for you (provided
you pay the postage costs).

: 
: Does anybody have the exact!? rules concerning repetitive moves?
:
There are some moves which are limited to 3, like perpetually checkiung
the opponent's general; others are unrestricted eg, Rook threatens the
Horse which in turn threatens the Rook again. In such situation, a draw
can be declared if both sides do not change the moves.
