Cool. Another version of the "Hex with draws" idea, which might reduce
the number of draws further, and perhaps the actual draw ratio, is to
play hex on a board with an odd number of cells and designate the
central hex off limits.  The central hex is a nice choice because it
is both the only unique cell on the board, and because filling it
often gives one an advantage, players would opt away from the draw
often (assuming that such a game is drawn with perfect play; I don't
actually know).  Also, then you you wouldn't have to count out a
certain number of pieces for each side before the game beings, which
is more convenient.

The hex variants are good, but they aren't provably best when it comes
to minimizing # of draws or draw-ratios, in any way that I can see.
it would be nice to find games that do.

 A plausible Hex variant could be: Use an NxN board,
where N is odd.  Give each player (N^2-1)/2 tokens.  This leaves
exactly one space empty, and both players get the same number of
moves.

Since 5x5 and 7x7 are solved, it may be possible to check with brute
force whether this is enough to ensure a tie with perfect play.
