The dates for the 12th MSO (Mind Sports Olympiad) in the UK have been 
confirmed as Saturday 16th August to Bank Holiday Monday 25th August. 
Venue is in London.   I know it's a big place but I'm sure there will be 
more information about exactly where pretty soon!

Today (14th April) this information is not on the MSO website - perhaps 
anyone wanting to be run the website for the MSO could get in touch with 
them to offer their services.    The events themselves I'm sure will be as 
well run and enjoyable as ever.

Mike

(and we intend to run 6th Pacru World Championship, 3rd Azacru World 
Championship and 2nd Shacru World Championship there)
