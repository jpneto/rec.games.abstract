It's more than a correlation, the China Labyrint and the I Ching are
one and the same, the former only gives a completely natural and
endlessly varied graphical representation of the hexagrams of the
latter, and the way they interrelate in any specific divination.
Though Ed and I made it work, and though I copied the whole Legge
translation manually into it, I don't use it myself.http://mindsports.nl/index.php/i-ching-connexion/i-ching-divination

I guess the obvious way to apply the I Ching Connexion principle to
Stax is that each player view the tiles in front of them as the
associated hexagrams, and as tiles are rotated their meanings change
to the newly formed ones.

For example, tile 4 Meng (Youthful Inexperience) when rotated one step
clockwise would become tile 3 Chun (Initial Difficulties):

So a story would unfold as the game is played, and it would be
different for each player. Players could rotate pieces, pin pieces or
reveal pieces to change the story in meaningful ways, e.g. Joy might
be used to hide The Abyss. Keen players might even choose suboptimal
moves if it improved their story :)
