Thats how I usually play, but I always win in a much more spectacular fashion
when <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> give the edges the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>them<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. Usually give them the corners too. The
idea is to give them control of most of the edge, and the corner, but leave
a hole in the edge, which you can grab right near the end. This gives you
the side (minus the corners, but they aren't really all that important).
Of course, it is much easier to stuff up a game when playing like this, so
spectacular losses are about as common as spectacular wins. I just need more
practice.

Works when I play... Limit the moves available to them, and they'll be forced
to go somewhere very very bad. It also helps to arrange things so that you

the board.
