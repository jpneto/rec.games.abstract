Imagine that some kid from India, China, etc... 8 years old start painting.
He does know Picasso or Van Gogh but his style looks like Picasso or Van Gogh. 
This kid DID NOT imitate Van Gogh or Picasso. What we could say about this kid?
Is this kid a genius? Is this kid special? In the worst case we could say that this kid has some talent. 
The same rule has to prevail when it comes to a game designer.
He invented Othello without even knowing Othello. So he has a potential to be a game designer. The worst thing we could tell to this guy is THAT HE INVENTED an existing game! 
When I was kid I discovered the integrals before studying them. Until now I was very happy of that achievement.
I had never seen if BGG forum people trying to debate in detail some game except when the game is sent by someone who is a member of the "famiglia".
How MANY GAMES are uncommented in BGG?????????????
3 OR 4 TIMES the games commented!!!
Why?
It seems to me that people in the abstract game forum are in the forum not for helping others or even for learning but for STEALING what it could be STOLEN and that`s it!!!
Honesty is absent in that forum!!!
Hypocrisy rules!!!
