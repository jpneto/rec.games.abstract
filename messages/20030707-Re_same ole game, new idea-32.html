More notes, warning: chopped salad'


*Lately, I have been concentrating on the formation of characters.
This week I will concentrate on the formation/mating of worlds/games.
Players or game designers will be able to start out with one, or a
couple, of world/s or level/s, etc. and change them by a random binary
process, or maybe a process that is dependant on the happenings' on
the first level etc.
It is two-fold. The character evolves as does the character's
environment.
I will try to show, again, simple binary code for those worlds and how
they would be able to change, reproduce.'
How?
Something like the appearing and disappearing branches on a tree. 

*Um, How would you represent coin flipping to the gamer in binary, a
truth table? How about chess or tic-tac-toe? How would you be able to
mate them, whoa, a lot of work, eh?

*This is rough code:
Tic-tac-toe can be represented by a graph, maybe a tree graph. And
that tree graph can be converted into linear binary code.

*Side thought, can all games be represent by graphs/probabilities,
etc?

*One other idea, think tree graphs with some hidden branches, now
think of tree graphs with no hidden branches. Then you might know
where I think my idea is headed.
