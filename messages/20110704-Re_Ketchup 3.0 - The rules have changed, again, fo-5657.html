So if I had your intuition I'd never design a bad game - like Grabber.

I think it's flawed, yes. And indeed, counter to my intuition. That's
why it's called intuition. It's not a simple and safe black and white
world.

Speaking of unrlenting campaigns, while you were incessantly aggrandizing
your own intuition year after year, Nick was quietly developing a true

Indeed he did, good of you to notice. You show your lack of intuition
in your additional commentary:

Quote:
"Ketchup is essentially a draw susceptible game though, if both
players end up with the same largest group size. Adding a horse shit
rule (no offense, Nick) of then comparing the next largest groups, and
the next next largest groups, etc. hammers a square peg into a round
hole and it's an aesthetic disaster IMO."
End quote.

This misses the mark completely. Ketchup is not "essentially draw
susceptible". The rule you despise not only prevents that, but as Nick
rightly remarks, it "creates a whole new subgame in this situation
where the players' second and third- largest groups matter. So you
have to "play the whole board" more in order to win in those
situations."

It's really not that hard to see that this will deepen strategical
implications, and of course it affects tactics positively.
Intuition if you like (but you don't :)

P.S. What about the tweak in Sygo? Or are you satisfied to just throw
in a lie in the hope that it somehow sticks in the minds of your
perceived audience?
