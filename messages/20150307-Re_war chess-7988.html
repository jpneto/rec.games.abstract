We are getting a bit off-topic, but Macysburg is a game unlike any other that I've ever seen. Yes it has roots in both chess and wargames, but all games have roots in other things. Nothing arises de novo. So I would question your assertion of "totally new" as possible. 

The 3 shatranj variants I offered above were closely followed by by a side-step to the direct ancestor of Command and Maneuver, namely Chieftain Chess: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSchieftainchess">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSchieftainchess</a> and I offer this game as something reasonably new. It certainly got me thinking along different lines, and led to concepts like chesimals, chess animals. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/the-games:chesimals-1">http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/the-games:chesimals-1</a>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/chesimals-2">http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/chesimals-2</a> Would these qualify as a reasonably new idea? 

You see, I'm not sure what you mean by "totally new". In discussions with others and numerous internet searches, I've found others had somewhat similar ideas to the games I linked in this thread, but nothing that indicated somebody did any of these before. Truthfully, I'm surprised by this, because to me, once I started working on the games, they seemed to be perfectly simple and logical extensions of what I'd seen before. Thus I was surprised no one had done them before I did them.

What is totally new for example is :
My invention of capturing by "topological" symmetry! No one invented it before.
Or my idea to build an abstract game using real animals (mouse, cats, dogs) combined to kind of devices. 
Or using water in a game (gravity forces and so on)
I have hundreds of ideas never imagined before.
Anyway what you are considering as new is just some improvement.
What if you create game where building the arena play (board) is itself a part of the game?
What if each player can imagine under some constraints the pieces he will use their moves their way of capturing and so on?

Okay. Would you be kind enough to give me links to those games?

Sozee (here in rec abstracts) for the capturing by topological symmetry.
For the use of water you could find it in BGDF 
For the animals I had never publish it.
Keep in mind that I used more than 100 nicks in different forums to publish my games (I want to be anonymous. I`m not running for money or glory).
At least 200 games invented by me were published on Internet(BGDF,BGG,Trictrac,rec abstracts, my blogs, etc...).
And 100`s were never ever published.
All my games are stored in papers and some in one of my computers which is NOT connected to internet.

There is no need to be deliberately obscure. I go out of my way to try to not be obscure. I'm happy for people to know who I am and what I've done. To me, the purpose of a game is to be played and enjoyed. I make it easy to play my games. And I would be ecstatic to make some money, to help defray the costs of prototyping, playtesting, and traveling to show games at venues where they can get good playtesting. Every game of mine you find on the internet is very playable. While some may not like the style of games, I try to make my rules as clear and coherent as possible. I also listen to others' comments and critiques, and often enough incorporate suggestions. I see games as a somewhat cooperative venture between the designer and the players, and I am happy to get good ideas from people and use them where I may. 

I've run into a fair number of people who are afraid their ideas will be stolen, but it's been my experience that every designer has his or her own ideas, and is not interested in taking others' ideas. Ideas are cheap and easy, and a game design is not something actually worth stealing. A fully developed game might well be worth stealing, but by the time a design has been fully developed, there is almost always a "paper trail" - these days an electronic trail - that leads directly back to the designer of that game, and theft is generally plain. And copyright is every designer's right. 

To get to the specifics of Sozee, I find the rules could be written better. Your example for capture is obscure, and you really should have a section in the rules on what exactly the allowed geometric transforms are and how they work. You didn't, for instance, rotate 45 degrees, changing orthogonal to diagonal and vice versa, which is an available transform. 

Further, I have played an obscure published abstract at NonCon, held at Vassar College every year, that does use various geometric figures for scoring.. It's not identical to your game, but the two are clearly related. Your take on geometric scoring is the more obscure. (Grin, based on how you've presented yourself to me so far, you should <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>love<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Stanley Random Chess!) It's been some years, and I cannot remember the name, but iirc it is something like or reminiscent of Shakespeare - but don't hold me strictly to that, as I have a terrible memory.

Finally, I'd like to ask you about playtesting; what did your playtesters say about Sozee? I get the impression that the game got little or no outside playtesting. For one thing, good playtesters would have ensured a better rules package. I encourage you to make more use of playtesters for your designs. They can be very helpful in turning a decent design idea into a good, well-developed game.
