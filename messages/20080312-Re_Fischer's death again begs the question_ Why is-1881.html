<br>This theoretical argument is, of course, ridiculous as a practical

<br>sports (including soccer) without a hint of a problem, this situation
<br>already exists in chess because monetary prizes are awarded by
<br>place (not proportional to points).

<br>What is clearly wrong is characterizing a scoring system
<br>as a "penalty". Obviously both players face the same
<br>"penalty".&nbsp; Just about the only certain change we could
<br>expect for certain would be a sharp reduction in the numbers
<br>of uncontested or barely contested draws. Most people
<br>would see that as a good thing, but perhaps not Mr. Richerby.
