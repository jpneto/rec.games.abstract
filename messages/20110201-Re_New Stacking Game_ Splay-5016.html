Greg, let me be the first to congratulate you on a beauty of a game
and a new twist in the relation between the height of a stack and
specific surrounding cells. In most games that feature this
relationship, stack height is linked to the number of adjacent cells
only (Explosion, Explocus, Crossfire, Trounce).

Your implementation is more organic and has a predecessor only in Mu.
Mu it is layered, explosions ('splaying' in your game) blow away the
top layer, then proceed on the bottom layer. A top-layer explosion
let's the layer vanish from the exploding cell and thus lowers the
number of neighbors of adjacent top-layer cells, giving rise to chain
reactions.

That mechanism, splaying affecting the number of vacant neighbours of
adjacent cells, works similarly and wonderfully in Splay. To keep the
reactions balanced, the rule of 'collapsing' stacks that have become
to high to splay is as simple as effective.
A very elegant and solid game, congrats :)

I played a few games of Splay and watched the computer play itself
once.  My criticism is that the game seems to lack dynamics.  Flags
are permanent, and so the game seems to be to be a lot of nibbling
around the edges of a locked-in structure and as the game goes on it
gets less interesting because more and more of the board becomes
inert.  I wonder if the game wouldn't be better with some kind of
ongoing mechanism to challenge control all over the board.

I haven't played it yet, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions on the
basis of what the computer makes of it. In tactical terms, causing
opponent's stacks to collapse seems quite dramatic. But it requires
careful strategy to get to a position to be able to execute it.

Flags may be permanent, but so are live groups in Go. Nevertheless I
see you may have a point, though I can't really tell yet how serious
the 'lack of dynamics' will turn out to be. It may well turn out to be
a matter of taste. All I said about Splay could have been said about
my own game Symple: elegant, intricate, solid, new. But Symple lacks
drama, possibly more so than Splay. It's like a big ship heeling
slowly one way or the other, and by the time you get a clear picture
of which way, it's too late to do much about it.

Games like that require a strategist who likes to look deep into the
opening arrangements to harvest small advantages in the end. And small
advantages yet win the game, in the end.
