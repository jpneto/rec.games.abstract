|&gt;What about draws? If a first move can be chosen which would lead to

Oh, you are talking about games that are played without the pie rule.
I was tallking about games that DO use the pie rule. Sorry for the
confusion. But even without the pie rule, suppose a list of initial
moves that lead to a draw is known. Then restrict the first move to
one on that list.
