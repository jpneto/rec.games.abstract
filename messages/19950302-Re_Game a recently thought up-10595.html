The game is not new; I haven't played it enough to learn the strategic
details, but I had a shareware version of it some time ago.  This version
enforced a move/wall/move/wall sequence.  Every time I played it, the
computer moves its token next to mine, and we had a lot of cases where we
were both trapped, but the player to move lost.  

              Interesting game, though.
