   Speaking of checkers, I heard (recently) that quite a number of the
   positions had been solved and that someone (somewhere) was getting pretty
   close to the end.  Hmm... is checkers a finite game?  Anyone know anything
   about any of the preliminary results?  Have there been any good articles
   written on computer Othello or checkers recently?

This sounds like Jonathan Schaeffer's group at the University of Alberta.
Yes, they've got a huge endgame database for their Chinook system.  They have
a TR on "Reviving the game of checkers" from UA, plus an article in the AI
Journal (1992, v.53) on their system.  In that article they talk about
challenging the current checkers world champion; I don't know if that's
happened yet.

Finiteness of checkers: There are endgame configurations in which you can
shuffle kings back and forth cyclically, so technically it's infinite.  Most
human opponents agree on a draw when it's obvious that this is happening and
neither has an advantage.  Because this happens far into the endgame with few
pieces left, I don't think checkers programs have difficulties dealing with
it.

Computer Othello: The US Othello Association occasionally mentions Othello
programs.  The Computer Olympiad books that I've seen have sections devoted to
various games including Othello, so you can get an idea of what new techniques
are being used.  But my impression is that it's hard to find out details about
the current top Othello programs because (obviously) the programs are still in
competition and the authors don't want to give away any secrets.
