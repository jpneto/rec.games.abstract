1.  i believe (and can prove) the unadulterated game of hex is a first
player win.
2.  i believe that the modified hex above is a draw.

There was a proof given by the person who suggested Vex in a previous
article. The comment I made was to someone that stated it was known that
Hex was a first player win. It looked to me like they had missed the part
about removing a hex in Vex. I didn't copy over the proof in that article
but did comment that I believed the proof given was correct.
The proof basicly was:
The player removing the hex can avoid losing by treating that action as
the first move in the game of Hex and using a winning stratgey for Hex.
The player to make a first regular move can avoid losing by treating the
removed Hex as a bonus move and following a winning strategy for Hex.
The bonus move cannot hurt you in Hex (though the empty does hurt you in Vex).
This shows that with best play that Vex will end in a draw.
