If you do a google search for the phrase "pagoda function" one of the 
early results is an article called "Modelling and Solving English Peg 
Solitaire" which sounds related to your problem.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The problem is that deciding if a configuration c is reducible to a
configuration c' is NP-complete. So, it's difficult to have that final
single final configuration.
I could use the rule of three to decide if a game is not playable, but
the rule of three did not give me a method to enumarate all really
possible
final configuration (the rule of three is only a necessary condition).

I want to write a program that can solve an arbitrary initial
configuration,
created by the user. So i don't know the final configuration.

So, which pagoda function should i use???

 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I ask this because if i can compute the possible final configurations,
i
can than compute a pagoda function specialized to work with one of
that final
configurations (the manhattan pagoda function). Otherwise, i really
don't know
how to use a pagoda function (wich? for wich final configuration?) if
i have
to solve an arbitrary initial configuration...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not sure I understand you; pagoda functions are independent of 
configurations.  You probably will want a set of many pagoda functions, 
but not all of these will change after each move.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, i'm really new to pagoda function. I have read so little about
this
functions and i don't know if i can use this functions to make some
cut to
the search space (remember that i use a brute-search algorithm).

Here's what I would try:
...
Use DFS.  After each jump you try, just add the difference vector for 
that jump to the current score, and continue.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Uhmm..., i'll read more carefully what you have wrote..i don't
understand
english very well so i have not understood very well what you have
written..

By the way, in your initial message you say you are keeping a "cache" of 
all configurations that cannot be reduced to a single peg - I suspect 
that this could be quite large (since 33 holes gives roughly 2^33, about 
8 billion, configurations) so I wonder if memory use is part of the 
problem.  Also, how are you searching this cache?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I map each configuration to a 64-bit value. The cache is a bb-tree.
When i search a particular configuration in the cache, i check also
the
symmetric configurations (for a given configuration  there are 7
equivalent other configurations).

The cache really help to speed up the process, because the game is
highly symmetric. By the way, some configurations take more to
calculate.

The cause is clear to me: the order in which the possible moves are
tried
make the difference.

So, i use a function that try to say:"this move is better than this
other".
But this procedure needs to look-ahead 3/4 moves to work decently.

But the look-ahead take much time...so now i have a program that in
some
cases work faster without look-ahead than with lookahead.

I've not found any other cut to use to speed-up the process :(
