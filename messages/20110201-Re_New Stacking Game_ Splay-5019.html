I'm willing to give it another few plays and see what happens.  It's
likely that it's a game with depth that just doesn't "click" for me.
It's not always easy to know why a game clicks for some but not
others.  So far, the things that don't appeal to me are the slowness
of playing pieces on your own pieces to make towers, and the way in
which the areas of inert flags don't seem to have an interesting
influence on further play.  Maybe I'm wrong about the latter.  Maybe
its just not going to be my cup of tea.  Maybe both.  But I'm just one
guy and there are plenty of other games that didn't happen for me that
others love, so no worries for you.
