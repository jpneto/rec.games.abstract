Hazen, please. I'm trying to go through my transition as a transmorbid individual and do something for abstract games that aren't the shittiest thing ever like Chess. Have some respect for the dead would ya?

Not all the dead deserves respect.
War criminals do not deserve respect.
But any human being deserves to be buried according to his believes.
What I mean by respect towards dead is to give them any remembering or some ceremony or something like that. A war criminal once buried should be forgotten for ever. That is the only to treat war criminal like Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon, Hitler, Staline, Milosevic, the american President who drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and others.
