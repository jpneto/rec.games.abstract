In order to get a regulation ACF checker set, you have to order from
their store directly.  There is a more than favorable chance that such
equipment will be available elsewhere pretty soon.

I have had conversations with them, and the barriers to get them
spread is fairly large.  This is the basis upon which I have spoken in
this thread.

Aside from the fact that given the sheer pain of the three-move
restriction - and image problems of Checkers in comparison to Chess -
has limited <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>serious<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> interest in Checkers to a level far below that
which exists in Chess, there is another problem.

Their <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>regulations<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> are verging on the silly, which leads stores to
expect low demand for sets that meet them.

They require a board with exactly 2 inch squares. This is at the low
end for tournament chess boards; if they instead allowed the same
flexibility that the USCF and FIDE allow for tournament chess boards,
it would be easier to make combination chess and checkers sets.

Green and buff are a good color for the squares on the board; Chess
players would have no quarrel with that.

But white and red checkers, I feel, are not a good choice. Checkers is
played on the green squares. Red doesn't contrast well with green - if
you're color-blind. And because the red checkers are the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>light<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
checkers in a conventional set of red and black checkers, people will
be confused about which checkers in the regulation set correspond to
which checkers in a conventional set.

White and blue? Yellow and black? White and a light green shade that
still contrasts well with the green squares? Chess players seem to
think that white and black pieces don't lead to eyestrain, but then it
is true that it can be hard to tell if a black checker is turned King
side up.

But maybe white and red was the best choice, and people can get used
to it.
