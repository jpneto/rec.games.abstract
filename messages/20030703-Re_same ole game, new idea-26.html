Games of chance, games of imperfect information, are so much better.

A matter of personal taste, certainly.  I play and enjoy both, but I have much
greater respect for games of perfect information.

I have never come across your phase of "perfect information" until
now, and after taking the treat into my mouth, my thoughts turned
sweet, "I don't know what feels better winning with perfect
information or winning with imperfect information."

In a world of imperfect information, I see your point of view for
liking games with perfect information. But, I think games with perfect
information played by two equal players are really games at all, no
games as we know it anyway, winners and losers, etc. The games amount
to a draw or not worth playing because of its known outcome. Think
something like tic-tak-toe multiplied a thousand times or so.

But there is so much more to a world, and game, with imperfect
information.
Wonders unhand, my lad, wonders unhand : )
