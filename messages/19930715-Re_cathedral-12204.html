For those that do not know Cathedral, it is a game where two player attempt
to fit all of their pieces into a square playing field and prevent their
opponent from doing the same. There is a simple concept of territory (cf
Go). The game's name derives from the fact that there is a distinguished
neutral piece, the Cathedral, that is placed by the first player as his/her
first move.

Any expansion on this very brief (and somewhat cryptic) description?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Each player has a set of peices of various shapes (made up of a bunch of
square peices stuck together - much like pentominos but some with more and
some with less than 5 squares).  Some of them look a bit like these:

     #    ##    ##    ###     ##     ###    #        #
                #     #        ##    # #   ####     ###
                                #          #         #

The cathedral is shaped like

                              #
                            ####
                              #

Suppose the peices are coloured white for player 1 and black for player 2.
The cathedral is some neutral colour (neither black nor white).

The playing area is a square grid of (from memory, roughly) 10 by 10
squares. The pieces are such that they can fill the board entirely if
played in an appropriate pattern.

Player 1 starts by placing the cathedral piece anywhere he chooses. The
players alternately place pieces on the board. The object is to play as
many of your pieces as possible (minimise the number of squares worth of
pieces you cannot place) and to prevent your opponent from placing as many
as possible. If near the end of the game one player cannot place a piece,
the other can continue placing pieces until he has run out or cannot place
any more. The person with the least value of remaining pieces wins (value
of pieces are the number of squares they are made of).

If a player's move results in an area of the board being surrounded by a
connect wall (no diagonal connections) of two or more of his pieces, such
that it is either empty or contains 1 of the opponent's pieces (the
cathedral, while being placed by player 1 is not player 1's pieces), then
this area becomes that player's territory, the opponents piece (if there
was one) is removed, and the opponent may not play in that area for the
rest of the game. I cannot remember whether the captured piece can be later
played or must count are points at the end of the game.


The basic idea is to start by capturing as much territory as possible (best
to capture a piece as well if at all possible) and then fill up the
"shared" regions (between white and black pieces), then finish by fitting
as many of your pieces as possible into your territory.

A bit like playing GO, filling in at the end (like in chinese scoring), and
then counting the number of black and white pieces unplayed - the least wins.


(Sorry this is not polished as much as I would like, but I just realised I
got carried away and spent way too much time on news this morning...hope
this helps)
