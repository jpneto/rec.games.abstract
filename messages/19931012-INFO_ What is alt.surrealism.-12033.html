Spectrally conceived in the Keflavik Airport sometime between Luxembourg and
Baltimore in the midst of a cool icelandic 3 AM midmorning. "We really could
subvert this stuff worldwide, you know." The man from Finland paid no heed but
then whoever said Icelandic and Finnish were sister languages obviously said it
in something other than Catalan.

"Well, there's alt.nonsequitur but that just encompasses nonsense." And justly
so!

CECI N'EST PAS alt.nonsequitur (nor talk.bizarre nor alt.stupidity) !!

Of course things are not moderated so there is no overt control over anything
posted. Controlled surrealism sounds like nothing more than impressionism. But
endless posts of, "This is not a post." and "How many surrealists does it take
to unscrew a lightbulb?" lend nothing to having a serious group devoted to
pursuing surrealism. PLEASE post so said pampringada to one of the places listed
below.

Suggestions:
        talk.bizarre is for eccentric/original/experimental prose/poetry
        and inside jokes.  Nonsense is just as unwelcome there but they
        have not been able to stamp it out.

        alt.nonsequitur is a perfect place for nonsense.

        jokes and riddles are welcome in rec.humor.  We've already
        heard the one about the lightbulb.  A hundred times.

        nonsense is NOT an insult, nonsense has its place, but
        alt.surrealism is not that place.



What is surrealism?

AH! the ever handy pocket surrealist dictionary..

surrealism: "The vice known as Surrealism consists of the disordered and
passional application of the stupefying image." [ARAGON]
"Surrealism, in its wider sense, represents the most recent attempts to break
with <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>things as they are<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> and to substitute for them other things -- immediately
operational and fully-formed -- whose shifting contours are inscribed in
filigree in the very depths of being." [RAYMOND]

Confused? Well we already have a topic for discussion. . .

   What about dreams?
   What's the paranoiac critical method?
   Why the clouds and men in bowlers?

.. . ... perhaps some day a FAQ .. . . .


Automatism --

A real reason some of us in our collective crania wanted to procreate this group
into existence.

     "Solitary and collective automatic techniques, and the exploitation of
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>chance<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> are central to many surrealist games. The original surrealists soon
came to realize the limitations of *pure automatism.* Automatic techniques may
be used as a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>beginning<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of creative activity, to stimulate and encourage
spontaneity of utterance or image making."

We would like to start some mass induction of group-created, automatic art.
Simple games such as "The Exquisite Corpse," and others used by surrealists can
be readily adapted to distribution and propagation on the net. With some working
we hope to do the same with graphic art leaving this or perhaps another created
group, if the interest exists, for the posting of surrealistic imagery or of
works created automatically by group effort or by individuals. Once again,
though overlap certainly exists with alt.nonsequitur, alt.stupidity, etc. PLEASE
do not use this group as a repository for things that you would post to these
other groups.

Automatism aside we certainly hope that this group will serve as an ideal forum
for discussing surrealism, it's role in shaping history, techniques used,
psychology or lack thereof and not just end up as a repository of the
surrealistically inspired.

If anyone has any ideas how to organize groups for playing "net games of the
surreal," or for posting imagery please post them here. Such things should be
for mass discussion before we attempt them.

Those who would be interested in participating in any "games" we set or have
suggestions for games to try can drop me a note at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:lynn@pharmdec.wustl.edu">lynn@pharmdec.wustl.edu</a>.
Please save the burning giraffes for a bucket of water.
