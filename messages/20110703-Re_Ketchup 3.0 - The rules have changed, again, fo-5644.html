I lately discovered how to make Ketchup, one of my best games, better.
So now I'm posting my second major revision in as many years. First
I'll describe the new rules, such as they are, and then discuss why
Ketchup warms my pants and why I'm so happy about the new version.
Here we go:

Ketchup is a game for 2 players played with red and green stones on a
hexhex5 board.

I like it. Does a 7-wide game make a deeper game, or just a longer one?

Terminology
*Group - a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board.
*Group Size - the number of stones that a group contains. The smallest
possible group has a size of 1.
*To Drop - to place a stone on any empty space.

Rules
*The board begins empty. One player owns the red stones and the other
owns the green stones.
*Red begins by dropping a single stone.
*Then, starting with Green, the players take turns. On his turn, a
player drops 2 stones.
*When a group of at least size 2 has formed, the nature of the turns
change. From then on, on your turn, if your largest group is smaller
than your opponents largest group, you must drop 3 stones. Otherwise
you must drop 2 stones.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If your first or 2nd stone creates your first group of size greater 
than 1, and your opponent already has even bigger groups, do you get
to play a 3rd stone?

I.e., looking at it another way, are the drops all simultanious?
