They are certainly little known; I've never heard of any of

You should come give some of them a try then!  "Cannon" in particular
is a superb game.  The audience for such games is already small so I
try not to fragment it further by implementing games that already exist
in other places.  Some of the games turn out to be misses, but most of
them are very enjoyable.  The asynchronous implementation is also great
as you don't have to have large contiguous blocks of free time.  We
also have some great players, many of them game designers themselves.
Anyway, it's free, it's a hobby for me, and I'm just always looking for
more opponents =)  Maybe we'll see some of you around.

Cheers!
Aaron
