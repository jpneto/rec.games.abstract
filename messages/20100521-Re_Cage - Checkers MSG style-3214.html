Thanks fizzy :)  It'd be a cruel irony if a Checkers variant turned
out to be my best game, but I can't strictly rule it out at this
point.  It's Checkers without the waltzing.

Greg Schmidt is unavailable to program right now.  Nobody has
programmed Cage yet.

lol Yeah, I really don't like to criticize other designers, believe it
or not.  Some games, it's not so much that they're crap.  Lot's of
games are crap.  My comments about Crapf are not directed at the
designer.  They're directed at the legions of retards like Harald
Korneliussen, the Toys R Us groupies who believe that if it ain't
shrink wrapped, it ain't shit, who exalt the crap.  Like if this shit
is considered "genius", I don't even want to waste my time.
