When they brought in the

I agree 100%. There really are no short-cuts here: even if Richard
Hutnik's evolutionary chess programme is perfect, and even if he would
have proposed the same even if it didn't have his or his
organization's name on it... this is something Chess players will have
to deal with on their own, without outside intervention.

Interesting that you touch on this problem, because bent four in the
corner is only a problem in Japanese scoring (and maybe Korean?). It
is already cleared up in many rulesets, Area scoring rulesets never
had it as I understand.

American checkers players accepted a radical change to their game, but
the Japanese Go players apparently don't feel their game is broken
enough to warrant it. That's their call to make.

If you don't know it, take a look at Robert Jasiek's comparison of Go
rulesets:
