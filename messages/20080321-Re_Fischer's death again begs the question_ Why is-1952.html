<br>But since losing gets as much worse as winning gets better, and combative play 
is often riskier, you haven't really changed anything in the net risk/reward 
equation.&nbsp; It still averages out.

<br>
<br>This is incorrect. In anti-draw scoring, drawing and
<br>losing becomes closer. So it pays to take risks that
<br>give you winning chances, even if you might lose.
<br>Earlier I gave an example: A player can chose
<br>between two moves. In the first, he can simplify the
<br>position to an ending and he estimates his
<br>chances as: W=0, D=0.9, L=0.1 In the second move,
<br>launching a counterattack, he estimates his chances
<br>to be W=0.3, D=0.3, L=0.4.
<br>
<br>With 1867-scoring (Wins = 1 point, draws = 1/2 point
<br>and losses =0), the expectation of either move is
<br>identical (0.45). Now imagine that we used "soccer"
<br>scoring, for example (Wins = 3 point, draws = 1 point
<br>and losses =0) Now the simplifying move is worth 0.9,
<br>and the counterattacking move is worth 1.2
<br>
<br>Without changing the underlying rules of chess, we've
<br>altered the meta-game to provoke more interesting
<br>play. Just because something seemed reasonable to
<br>try 141 years ago, doesn't mean it makes sense for
<br>today's game.
