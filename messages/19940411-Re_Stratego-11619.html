You certainly can win by attacking, but in my experience you will win more
often by defending against an attack than starting one. The defender will
normally gain a favorable exchange of material due to their shorter supply
lines. The attacker needs to focus their attack against the location of the
flag and use their local superiority to win. Since you shouldn't know the
location of the flag, this is going to lose more often than not for the
attacker.

The problem with making good computer players for 2 player zero sum games
is not from psychology. Psychology can only be used to gain an advantage
against nonoptimal players. And there is the risk that you are going to be
out guessed if you play this way (making poor plays, counting on further
poor play by your opponent to make your poor play better than optimal play).
The difficult part is being able to analyse the game well enough to find
the optimal strategies. Normally you have to settle for an approximation
that may or may not be very good.
