Permit me to contribute some information I received from a talk given
by Jon Schaeffer (one of the authors of the checkers program Chinook)
at the recent workshop in combinatorial games.

1)  It's clear that the top two players (human or otherwise) are
Tisdale and Chinook.  They are both far above the ability of all other
players.

2)  Tisdale is happy to compete against a computer for the world
championship.  Not only does he find no philosophical problem with it,
but he has the added advantage of finally getting some "decent"
competition (by his standards).

3)  The world checkers federation (I don't know its name) does not
agree.  Therefore, Tisdale is playing in a Silicon Graphics sponsored
event and is disassociating himself from the largest checkers
organization.

4)  Concerning the assertion that checkers has essentially been
mastered by humans:  Yes, it is true that in practice strong players
will draw virtually all there games.  Consequently, current high level
tournament practice is start from a randomly selected position, P,
which is obtained by making a few random moves from the usual starting
configuration.  Games are played in pairs, with the two players
getting the opportunity to play both colors from P.

5)  There are many different checkers variants, and the standard
variant played in these tournaments is American.  When a checker
reaches the last rank, the check is promoted to a "king", which can
then move backward or forwards one square (or jump to capture).  It
may NOT move like a bishop, as in some variants played especially in
Spain, Eastern Europe and Asia.

6)  I'm not an authority.  I hope I've been vague enought to be
accurate.

David&gt; Why is there a computer playing in the checkers world

David&gt; especially seeing that checkers has almost been 'solved' by
David&gt; computers.

i once read that checkers had been essentially mastered by humans as
well and that the only way of winning a tournament was to come up with
more 'cooks' than the other guy, which essentially consists of baiting
your opponent into making a mistake.  samuel's algorithm is nearly
unbeatable, as i understand it.

David&gt; You won't see a chess world championship with a computer in it!
David&gt; ( I hope :-) )

maybe not yet, but i wouldn't bet on it not happening soon.  the best
chess programs are master-rank now.

The Silicon Graphics World Checkers Championship is being held in 
Boston at the Computer Museum, August 15-25.  The World Champion,
Dr. Marion Tinsley, is putting his title on the line against the
computer program Chinook (Martin Bryant, Robert Lake, Paul Lu,
Jonathan Schaeffer, Norman Treloar).  It is a best-of-30-game
match.

On Monday, the opening ceremony was held, with speeches from
Raymond Keene and David Levy (match organizers), Marvin Minsky
(professor in artificial intelligence), Bob Bishop (sponsor, 
president of Silicon Graphics International, and Tony Buzan.
