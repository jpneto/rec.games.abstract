To get back to the original question about games that are better
suited for humans than computers, there are several factors that can
be exploited to effect this:

 1) Make the search space large.  Most computer programs for games
    rely on (almost) exhaustive search of the next several moves.  If
    this is made unrealisable by having a huge number of possible (and
    not obviously bad) moves, a human may exploit his cognitive
    abilities to beat a computer.  Go makes the search space large by
    having a very large board with legal moves in every gridpoint.
    You can also increase the search space by adding randomness or
    hidden information (e.g. secret setup, as in Stratego).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Large search space only works that `normal� modern  computers can solve it, 
but in the future it could be solvable. But you can easily check if it 
theoraticly solvable by calculate the search space. 3D games are not easily 
solvable, but it take too many time to finish it. Just look at 
monsterqubic.

 2) Add more players.  Interaction between three or more players is
    hugely more complex than two-player interaction, so computers tend
    to do badly at these, while such interaction is a natural part of
    human life.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Is more humanly playable if you make it a multiplayer. Generally rule is 
that a computer doesn�t accept a multiplayer game. There I think of Toggle 
of War that is solvable in the two player variant, but in the multiplayer 
variant it�s hell for the computer.

 3) Add subjective elements.  Apples to Apples is a prime example.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don�t understand that point 3.
 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 4) Add natural language understanding as an element.  Ditto
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You want to make it internationally playable. So be carefully to add too 
many language specific stuff into it. But abstract games and natural 
language understands don�t mix well, but in strategical multiplayers games 
you need to that too.


So I come to conclusion a create a multiplayer, with a large 3d board 
without any borders where you need strategical interaction between the 
players. The moves you can make should offer many possibilities. So many 
playable strong pieces.

And ideally the moves have to be made at the same time. That could make it 
unsolvable and still playable for humans.
