Has anyone heard of the game "Wff 'n' Proof" or, better still, know the
rules? It's a sort of logic game, published in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
I have just acquired a set but no rules.

I recently obtained a set. The rulebook is pretty involved- over 150 pages,
and 21 distinct games, in increasing complexity. I assume you have 36 cubes, 
some playing mats, and a timer. Basically, the game starts by rolling out
the cubes onto the table. One player "sets a goal" by constructing an
expression in symbolic logic. Then players take turns moving one cube at a
time to either the "permitted" mat or the "required" mat, until someone is
able to use one more cube + all the required symbols + any number of
permitted symbols to construct a valid "proof" of the goal expression. The
complexity lies in the rules of logic, as well as the rules regarding
challenging any perceived mistake. I would estimate the rulebook is worth
more than the rest of the game. If you're interested, Stephen, email me and
I could sketch an outline of the rest of the rules.

This game is similar in structure to "Equations," made by the same people,
which deals with arithmetic expressions, which most people are more familiar
with. Equations is easier to introduce to newbies.

To give some idea of the complexity of Wff'N'Proof, here's a puzzle from the
beginning of the rulebook. NOTE: English language expressions such as these
are not used during
play of the game itself. The words if, then, and, or, not, &amp; only have a
very precise meaning here.

THE TARDY BUS PROBLEM

Given the following 3 statements as premises:

1) If Bill takes the bus, then Bill misses his appointment, if the bus is
   late.

2) Bill shouldn't go home, if (a) Bill misses his appointment, and
   (b) Bill feels downcast.

3) If Bill doesn't get the job, then (a) Bill feels downcast, and
   (b) Bill should go home.

is it valid to conclude:

Q1 that if Bill takes the bus, then Bill does get the job, if the bus
   is late?

Q2 that Bill does get the job, if (a) Bill misses his appointment, and
   (b) Bill should go home?

Q3 that if the bus is late, then (a) Bill doesn't take the bus, or Bill
   doesn't miss his appointment, if (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q4 that Bill doesn't take the bus, if (a) the bus is late, and
   (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q5 that if Bill doesn't miss his appointment, the (a) Bill shouldn't go
   home, and (b) Bill doesn't get the job?

Q6 that Bill feels downcast, if (a) the bus is late, or (b) Bill misses
   his appointment?

Q7 that if Bill does get the job, then (a) Bill doesn't feel downcast, or
   (b) Bill shouldn't go home?

Q8 that if (a) Bill should go home, and Bill takes the bus, then
   (b) Bill doesn't feel downcast if the bus is late?

I'll give the answers later. :)
