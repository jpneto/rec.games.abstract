If it were up to me, yes.  But the guy you were talking to is the boss here.  &gt;We call him Hazen.
I wish I had time to investigate your game, but law school demands all my time. &gt;Sounds interesting though, just skimming through it.  Don't worry if it's &gt;exactly the sort usually discussed.  We've got bandwidth to spare.

I'd like to discuss the idea that it's "just" complexified chess, deliberately made more difficult. It is not, and it cannot be played like chess. It is simplified wargaming, and must be played like a wargame. Attempting to play it like chess will drive you totally crazy. It is a highly streamlined wargame running on a chess "engine". It is an easy wargame, not a difficult chess variant. One symptom of this is that whether you are up or down several pieces is generally totally irrelevant.

The CaM scenarios are pure combinatorial abstracts, but ones that cannot be analyzed in depth. A comment I get a lot from people who haven't played the game is that since there is no randomness, players can foresee several turns into the future, when the fact is that players cannot even foresee the end of a turn they've already started. The random generators used in most wargames are replaced in this game with something akin to mathematical chaos.. The easiest way to explain it is to note that there can be literally hundreds of moves available on a turn which all have about the same value, so predicting what your opponent's reply will be is usually effectively impossible. (And I've already pointed out that you cannot predict your own moves toward the end of your turn while you're making the moves at the beginning of your turn.) In some small situations, it is possible to be pretty accurate in predicting opponent moves, but across the board over the course of a game, these situations are few and far between, and "pretty accurate" is not "perfectly accurate."
