On the original board, I maintain with the others that the game is

I don't give a fuck what you maintain.  If my proof is sound, then I'm
right.  If I made an error, then I'm wrong.  One thing that lends
credence to my proof is that if there were an error, Dishonest Bill
(the university math professor) would have found it by now and had a
fucking parade over it.  The fact that he hasn't even acknowledged my
proof makes me even more confident than I already was.  I'm a
designer, not a mathematician.  But if Bill is pretending not to have
noticed my proof, what does that tell you?

The rhombus is perfect.  That's not even an issue.  Programmers will
most likely adopt the square since you can fit more cells into a
square window.
