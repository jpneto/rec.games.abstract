As everybody knows that Luis and Clark are big liars and notorious plagiarizers here is their forged "story":

I quote Clark :

"I had been mulling over the concept of a game where players would be distinguished by a dimension rather than a color for some time. I was on iggc one day casually tinkering with a terrible n-in-a-row concept in this vein which had an equally terrible name where players would score vertically or horizontally oriented lines when Luis popped in to my sandbox. We discussed what I was "working on" and then Luis promptly came up with the EUREKA which resulted in the Carteso we know and love today. That being the idea of scoring groups based on the orientation of their bounding boxes."

All this story is a big lie.
Clark is someone who read all my posts in rec abstract game.
Clark is known for stealing ideas of others and that is not the first time I caught him.

Here you can read what I wrote in September 2014

Quote of my post :
-----------------------------------------
Here is the story. 
I was working on a big abstract game. When I say big I mean very deep with an almost infinite tree but with easy rules. I still did not find which victory condition will be optimal. The game is based on the concept that one player "act" horizontaly and his opponent verticaly. Maybe the concept is not new (I did not try to search on google if it is the case). If it is the case I have to tell it to everyone even if I did know before. 
And suddenly I saw the knight with 4 cases controlled horizontaly and 4 verticaly. And after that I saw the rooks. Why not checkers or tokens? and so on. It is like the idea of half-stone but I was really angry because not one of you understood my goal. When you play hex (or go) you just drop stone or token. It costs you nothing! So what if we use half-stone keeping in mind that there is cost to pay to make the complete stone will be finaly yours if some conditions are fullfilled. It did not change the hex game but it will add a sort of fight for some cell. If your opponent succeed then the cell will belong will to him. 
----------------------------------

Anyone could see that was a big lie.
Clark and Luis who too usually read my posts are just thieves! Atajo de ladrones.

"From all this jibberjabbering, I ultimately want to communicate one thing, This is NOT my game! I cannot stress enough that, taking the above into account, its only appropriate for the community to consider Carteso a Luis Bolanos Mures invention. So congrats Luis on this phenomenal design!"

This is not you game both!!! Clark and Luis.
You are lying without shame.
You steal my idea and you are not honest to claim it.
That`s it.
