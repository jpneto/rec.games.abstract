I describe a simple Hex variant.

An e-pal of mine and I have been playing it for a little while, and it
seems to have considerable depth, perhaps even more than Hex itself.

Yet it is a very simple and obvious variant - we feel it must <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>surely<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
have been noticed before, and perhaps even written about.

__________________________________________________________
It is merely standard Hex, with one player having the north &amp; south edges,
and the other having east &amp; west, as usual; and the players playing black
and white stones, as usual; BUT - either player may play either colour of
stone on any turn.  A win is a join of your pair of edges by EITHER colour,
with mover winning if this happens to both simultaneously.  
Moving is compulsory.

We call it "Chameleon Hex", due to the ability to change colors at any time.

Anyone else know anything about it?
