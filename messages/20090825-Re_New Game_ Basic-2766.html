Of course.  As Nick mentioned.  Allowing backward movement would cause
the game tree to become larger.  In fact it would become infinite!

Of course it is also possible to design finite games where backwards
movements are allowed in at least some circumstances, so there's
nothing inconsistent with your design principles in the idea of
backwards movement.  Your own game Dipole bears this out, though I
realize that Dipole, with its two kinds of movement, doesn't satisfy
the simplicity constraint as well as you would like.

Still, it may be possible to to satisfy the simplicity constraint and
still have a movement rule that allows for backwards movement.  This
seems a really interesting challenge, in fact.  A different win
condition may be required to do it though.
