I bought Octi about two years ago and really like it.  My set's pieces are
wooden.  I've seen photos of the new Extreme sets and they look interesting.
Just for the sake of discussion (I have no plans to buy another set, unless
as a gift), I'd like to hear the opinions of players that have used the new
plastic pieces. What do you think of them?  Are they better or worse than
the wooden disks and pegs of the old sets, and why?  Are the prongs/wings
easier to work with (do they fall out easily/hard to put in, etc.)?  Also,
the new board: better or worse, and why?  And finally, what do you think of
the name change: appropriate or just confusing?
