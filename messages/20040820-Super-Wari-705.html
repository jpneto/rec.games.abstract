To all Wari players:-

I have composed and played a tiny amount, a variant of the classic mancala
game Wari.  The reason for composing it is that I feel that Wari has great
scope for strategic play, but that this is barely realised in the current
game with only 6 cells on each side.  Thus I have extended it to 8 cells,
which I think gives it the greater scope, while typically not requiring
any extra time to play, the same number of stones being used.

If anyone here should feel like an email game or two, please respond.

SUPER-WARI RULES
----------------
1. The board has 8 cells on each side, starting with 3 stones in each.

2. Movement is anti-clockwise, in the usual mancala manner, with
   the Wari capture rule:- if the final cell is an opponent cell
   which has become size 2 or 3, it is captured together with
   any other 2-or-3 opponent cells continuously backward from it.

3. The cell moved from is not re-sown in that turn.

4. A move may not be made which would leave the opponent with no stones
   on his side of the board; unless this is unavoidable, in which case
   the sower plays any move and wins all the remaining stones.

5. The usual "ko" rule applies - if a position repeats, each wins
   the stones left on his own side.
