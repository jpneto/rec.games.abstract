I am far from being any kind of expert on chaos theory (being merely one
with a wide background education in lots of areas) but I can at least
supply a little info, and maybe a couple of reading suggestions.

Chaos theory is not tightly defined.  It's more a collection of
observations, theories, concepts and the like that seem to be related to
each other somehow.  Most often, this relation is the belief that what
is usually believed to be randomness really isn't random.

One aspect of chaos theory deals in situations where there are too many
variables to keep track of, like in weather forcasting.  While the state
of the weather may be apparently the same as a previous state we've
seen, this is only due to our inability to identify all the variables,
no matter how small.  These miniscule differences make for drastic
differences within a surprisingly short amount of time, which is why
meteorologists can't accurately predict the weather more than a few days
in advance.  (the concept inadequately explained here is usually
referred to as sensativity to initial conditions)

When I referred to chaos theory creeping into the game, it was to a
degree a picture in my mind of something similar to the above.  Not only
do the players affect the rules, but the current state of the game
(position of pieces, cards played, number of players, time of day) also
affect the rules and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>how the rules are to be made or changed<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  While
the rules and modifiers could be simply stated (on tuesday, anyone named
Fred gets to make one extra rule modification) their affect on the game,
partly from their abundance, would be that each game, while starting out
exactly the same and having the players try to duplicate the exact
moves, would end up being drastically different.

If any of this fails to make sense, it's due to the fact that it's being
typed at 3:00 am.

A good book on the topic of chaos theory (written for the layman) is
"Chaos: Making a New Science" by James Gleick.  Published by Penguin
Books.  (C) 1987  softcover $9.95 US.  ISBN 0-14-009250-1.

I hope I was more help than hinderance.
