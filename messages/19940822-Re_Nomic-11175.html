Greetings:

Now that I've been made aware of the existence of previous Nomic groups,
anyone still want to start a new one? I'd also be interested in how the
following problems are solved:

1. How do you roll a die? My suggestion is that when voting 'yes' or 'no'
to a proposal each player provides a three-digit number that is then
totalled and divided by six.

2. How do you deal with private communication, which is forbidden (in the
initial set of rules) except amongst team-mates?

Both of these questions seem to deal with player honesty.  In both
games I've played over the net, there have been rampant opportunities
for certain players to cheat - and it hasn't been a problem.  If
anyone took advantage of it, it was very subtle.

Too many safeguards would be tedious, in my opinion.  I'd rather just
trust people, and kick out anyone who turned out to be immature.

3. What kind of time limits are set for play?

The canonical net Initial Set uses a more "parlimentary" system, with
players submitting proposals without a turn structure, and with a week
given for voting periods, returned Judgements, etc.

This set can be found at the Nomic faq:

There is an FTP site as well, the location of which eludes me right
now.

Any comments would be welcome, and if you want to start a game, let's do it!

I encourage you to start a game.  There has been some interesting talk
about communication between games and meta-nomic playing.  The idea is
that the games could affect each other; perhaps each nomic game would
be a player in the metagame.
