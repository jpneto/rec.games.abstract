Please see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_rules.pdf</a> for a
write-up of my new game, Scribe.  There's a game board printout at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_board.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Scribe_board.pdf</a>.

Scribe is a very unusual two player game.  It's a departure from my
usual design style, and I expect a departure from anything you've
ever seen.  You need three things to play Scribe: a pen, a blank sheet
of paper (the board is easy enough to draw), and a pretty good memory.
There are 19 "glyphs" that you must either know or have handy on a
chart.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

There are 512 (2 exp 9) possible permutations of Xs and Os.  In half of
these, X owns less squares than O.  (X,O) =
{(0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)}.  Of those 256 permutations, exactly
half are wins for X and half are wins for O in Scribe.  So if they both
play randomly, they will each have exactly 50% chance of winning.
There will be no advantage in moving first or second in random play.  I
tried to make the subgroups equitable as well.  For example if X has 3
squares and O has 6, they both have 42 possible winning permutations.

Not every subset was perfect.  For example if X has zero and O has 9,
that's a win for O.  But the discrepancies were negligible.

Though the glyphs may seem arbitrary, they're not.  The 1 square
glyphs and 2 square glyphs could only take one shape.  The 3 and 4
square glyphs were dictated by equitability requirements.  There was
some wiggle room with the larger glyphs, especially the 7 square
glyphs.  But there I chose palatable, recognizable patterns over
awkward, random looking patterns such as the "scrambled eggs"
glyph.  Overall there was very little choice in glyph selection given
the constraints of equitability and aesthetics.

Draws cannot occur in Scribe.
