Ok.  I was just musing and I don't have a strong opinion on the balancing
mechanism used for Redstone, including prisoner return, komi, Sygo, etc.

I don't understand how the four move pie works.  One player is tasked with
making all four moves? That would be a big responsibility.  I still think
anything more sophisticated than pie would be baggage at this point, given
how little is currently known about balanced Redstone openings.

It may be baggage, but I suspect it is unlikely, there is enough in common with Go that corners will still take priority, and as there are 4 of them, I think a 4 move pie rule will generally commit an overall strategic direction, rather than just a bad move (which the 2-2 I think would represent). In this way, it's balanced through subtlety rather than outright suboptimal play.

My idea was that either player starts with Black, and they alternate for those 4 moves (2 moves each), then Black chooses to play move 5, or swap colours because even with the initiative to Black, he prefers White.

PS Further congratulations are warranted. I had suspected that tactically, situations would be different to Go, but not necessarily more complex or less complex, just requiring the learning of different shapes. As I'm getting more familiar with the reading complexity, I think Redstone adds a whole extra dimension to reading depth. The fact that the 3rd stone type effectively makes the board itself malleable means that the move tree is roughly the same length (because of valid plays to play), but the actual impact on the status of groups has a lot more necessary depth of reading to evaluate. In many ways, the tactical capture situation in Go is relatively simple, it just requires the ability to read ahead and recognise typical shapes and false eyes. In redstone, the very board itself can change half way through the variation, completely changing the analysis of remaining eyespace. Eyes can be created out of thin air, and two space eyes can be simply removed with the addition of the red stones. I'm still only scratching the surface, but I'm actually beginning to be sad that Go is the widely played game, not Redstone.

This is the first Go variant I've seen and played (and I've played a few) that feels like it may possibly turn out to be an enhancement to Go, rather than just a new game.
