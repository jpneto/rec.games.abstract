Uh... while I like this game :) it's not abstract,

What makes you say that? (What's your definition of "abstract" 
in this context?)
It has no theme
It is a "perfect information" game (no hidden information)
It is entirely skill-based - no luck

It's debatable;  but I claim it is a game of hidden information.

In chess, if I try to move N-KB3, I am pretty sure that the knight 
will end up on KB3.  In crokinole it is hard to predict exactly 
where the pieces will end up, at least for a beginner.

I wouldn't call that hidden information - I would call it
un(der)developed skill.
In chess, a beginner might anticipate moving a piece, touch it and 
move it there, realize it may be an error, and adjust the move before &gt; taking a hand off of it.

Well, we can start including football and the like into abstract games
as well in that case (not that I don't like football, just that I don't
consider it abstract). With chess and go and the like you can abstract
out the relevant features of the game (where, e.g. the shape and feel of
the knight is not espeically relevant) and move it to another medium.
People have being playing chess via mail for a while now (and these days
over e-mail or RT over the internet). I have seen Real Chess Players who
play in their heads, just announcing the moves to each other with no
board (and THAT really floors me)

Of course you can object that chess and go are not completely medium
independant, since being unable to read physical queues from your
opponent when playing over the internet, for example, changes the game.
When compared to the differences between say football and foosball,
though, these are fairly trivial.
