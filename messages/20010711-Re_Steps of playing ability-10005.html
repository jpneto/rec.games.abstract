You can define a "step" in playing ability so, that you can beat 75% of
opponents which are one step below. 

Than you can define the "complexity" of a game as the number of steps in
existence in the population of players.

BTW,  it seems to me that the number of "steps" says more about human
beings,  and about the partucular human beings who chose to
play the game than it says about the game itself.

A problem with this definition is that a set of several games, in any 
game where results are variable (including chess and go, because even if 
one player is better than another, he may sometimes lose), will reduce 
the effect of chance and increase the number of levels.

Are 6-game chess matches really significantly "more complex" in the 
sense described than chess?

The effect would be even stronger with games like Backgammon.
