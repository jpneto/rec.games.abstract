Hi,



Even if the game seems random it requires smart decision.

Is there a winning strategy?

If the 2 players act smartly will it lead to the winning of one of the 2 players (first to play or his opponent)?



Blackjack game (variant)



6 dice 6-sided (numbered from 1 to 6) are needed.

The game is played between 2 players A (Alan) and B (Betty).

The goal of the game is to be the first to reach 21 points with less than 7 points over the opponent.

If one of the players exceed 21 points he lose the game.

If the player who reach 21 points and his opponent has less than 15 points his opponent is declared winner. 

The player A start the game rolling one die.

Let us call the result A(1).

The player A score k points. 

The player B has to roll A(1) dice.

After rolling the A(1) dice he has to choose one result among the B(1) dice. 

Let us call the result B(1). Player scores B(1) points.

Player A now has to roll B(1) dice and so on.

Each turn the scores add up until one of the player reach 21 points.



Example :



A turn 



A rolls 5 

A scores A(1)=5 points 



B turn 



B rolls 5 dice 

Results : 1,2,2,4,6

B choose : 6 

B scores 6 points B(1)=6



A turn 



A rolls 6 dice

Results : 1,1,3,5,6,6 

A choose 3 A(2)=3 points

A scores until now A(1)+A(2)=5+3=8 points 



B turn 



B rolls 3 dice 

Results : 1,2,6

B choose : 6 

B scores 6 points B(1)+B(2)=12



and so on until the player A (or B) reach 21 points with between the scores equal to less than 7 points (6 or 5 or 4 ...or 1).



Any comment is welcomed.



Thank you



I published the game long time ago (february 2012)

Here : <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://forum.projecteuler.net/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=2792">http://forum.projecteuler.net/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=2792</a>

I finally have found an elegant rule to make the game more randomness-free.
At the same time the game could multiplayer one.
