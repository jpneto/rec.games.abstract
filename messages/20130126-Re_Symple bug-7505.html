I'm racist because I called some assholes who lit a dog on fire, niggers? I'll use whatever terminology I want to insult people I dislike you bloated frog.

Why are you insulting Luis?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No no no, it doesn't work like that Hazen. I'm asking you to explain why you're insulting Luis, which you've done by extension of calling Slither and Crossway's gridlock resolution mechanics "botched". Since Luis has incorporated both the banned diagonal and the banned crosscut many times now in his own square board connection game design efforts you are insulting those efforts when you ridicule Crossway and Slither. Also its pretty obvious you're trying to be Luis' friend so you have some semblance of purpose here but the truth is nobody can stand your insolent bullshit. 

Furthermore I would love to hear a solution for creating a theoretically or practically draw free connection game on a Goban that doesn't involve banning anything.

Look at your Slither no one want to play it.

No one wants to play a game which is currently trending in the abstracts subdomain of BGG and is programmed on two websites where it receives regular play. Keep deluding yourself asswad.

It is a crappy crapipi game.

whatever crapipi is...

What is new on the game?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Basically everything. A connection game with movement? Extremely rare. The banned diagonal was a completely original invention. No other game before Slither had the rule that you could not place two like colored stones diagonally adjacent without an orthogonal connection. Even the concept of being able to make an illegal move mid-turn and resolve it by the end of your turn is something I haven't seen in other games. Slither is the height of originality.

People who are not dumb prefer to play Hex rather than your crappy game.

I haven't even mentioned Slither unprovoked in years

I defend your game and you defend my game that is what a gang of crappy designers are doing : congratulating one another.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

We hardly ever congratulate  one another and when we do its because the plebians like yourself that don't understand how to design games and the more subtle aspects of them will be happy to just let a potentially brilliant game fade into obscurity. I find a lot more derision being tossed around than congratulations in the design community. Except in your case Hazen there is only derision but then again you're not a designer.
