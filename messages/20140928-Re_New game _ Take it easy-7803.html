Hi,



Here is maybe the simpliest game ever with one rule.

Mirroring the play is not alllowed unless the game will not be a game.

If you are programmer implement it.

The scoring board will be on real-time.



Enjoy!

Family of games derived from TIE principle (Take It Easy) :

- You could rule that each player have the same set of tokens but numbered. The number is some sort of multiplier (1,2,3...). So the score of some cell X is multiplied by the number written of the token.

- You could define zones on the board where the cells inside the zones see their individual scores multiplied by some value (1,2,3...)

- You could even define some particular celles with a multiplier ...

- You could define a complex board with cells k-sided (where k =3,4,5,6,7,8....). Generating a random board with n sections (n depends on the number of turns assigned to each player)


Yes! It is hard to find some optimal equilibrium between all the rules above.

Starting with boards with no more than 12 cells will show you what is recommended and what is not.

By manipulating all the rules and the choices above you could generate 100000 of games.
You could apply it to any kind of games even wargames wordgames (I have an idea about this) and so on.
Applying the TIE principle to the wordgames will give the best wordgame possible.
I will post it soon : Word TIE.
