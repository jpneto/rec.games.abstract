Anyone interested in playing in the initial playtest of the following game
should sign up in the Redscape Forum (
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.redscape.com/forum/index.php">http://www.redscape.com/forum/index.php</a> ).  Look in New Game Openings.  You
will need to register, but it is a simple process.

This is a PBEM game featuring simultaneous negotiation.  There is no board
and there are no pieces.  The rules are simple, though there is some math
involved. The game, which I have named "Coalition", involves fifteen
players, each playing the part of a political party trying to form a
majority coalition in a fictional parliament.

Comments and suggestions would also be appreciated.



COALITION
Version 1.1
ï¿½ 2006 by David E. Cohen

1. You control one of fifteen political parties (a "Party") having seats in
the parliament ("Parliament") of the fictional central European nation of
Ruritania. The object of the game is to gain the most points through forming
a parliamentary coalition (a "Government") possessing a majority of all
seats in Parliament (a "Majority Government") and securing control of
government ministries (a "Ministry") through having your Members of
Parliament (an "MP") named Ministers in the Government. Though it does not
make a difference in play, players may name their Parties as they wish, set
forth a platform, communicate and negotiate with other Parties, and in
general, act like political leaders would in such a situation (so lying,
double crossing and other dishonesty is allowed).

2. Each of the Ministries to which an MP may be named has a point value,
ranging from 25 for the Prime Minister down to 1 for each Minister without
Portfolio ("MWP"). A single MP cannot be named Minister of more than one
Ministry, so there is an upper limit to the number of Ministries the
smallest Parties can hold. The point value of each Ministry is shown in the
following table, but each Party may secretly give the Constitutional Monarch
(the "CM") the names of four Junior Ministries which will have doubled value
("Special Ministries") for that Party if it holds that Ministry in the
Government being scored by the CM.

Ministry (Abbreviation): Point Value

Prime Minster (PM): 25

[Senior Ministries]
Defense (Def): 10
Finance (Fin): 10
Foreign (For): 10

[Junior Ministries]
Agriculture (Ag): 3
Education and Culture (E/C): 3
Environment (Env): 3
Fisheries and Forestry (F/F): 3
Health and Welfare (H/W): 3
Information (Inf): 3
Justice (Jus): 3
Mining and Energy (M/E): 3
Science and Industry (S/I): 3
Security (Sec): 3
Trade and Economy (T/E): 3
Transportation (Tra): 3

Without Portfolio 1 (WP1): 1
Without Portfolio 2 (WP2): 1
Without Portfolio 3 (WP3): 1

3. The CM tabulates each vote of confidence (a "VoC") called for by a Party,
referees disputes, calculates the scores of the Parties, publishes anonymous
and/or misleading press releases (all in the CM's discretion), and makes
other rulings, including setting the maximum length of the game. The CM will
tabulate each VoC to determine whether a Government has been formed and set
deadlines for votes of the Parties to be received, but will hold a VoC on
only one proposed Government at any one time. Parties may abstain, and any
Party not voting by the end of the voting period shall be held by the CM to
have abstained.

4. All Ministries must be assigned to a single MP of a particular Party in
any proposed Government, with the exception of each of the three MWP
positions. The three MWPs may be named or not, in the discretion of the
Parties forming the proposed Government, but each MWP must also be assigned
to a single MP of a particular Party.

5. Once a Majority Government has been formed or the maximum game length has
been reached, the game is over, and the CM will determine the scores of the
coalition members to and announce a game winner. If the maximum game length
is reached, and no Majority Government has been formed, the most recently
formed Government having received a majority of votes cast (a "Minority
Government") will be the Government analyzed by the CM to determine the
scores of the players. If the maximum game length is reached, and no
Majority Government or Minority Government has been formed, the proposed
government voted down which had received the highest number of affirmative
votes during the game (a "Caretaker Government") will be the Government
analyzed by the CM to determine the scores of the players. If the maximum
game length has been reached, and no Majority Government, Minority
Government or Caretaker Government has been formed, then the game shall be a
draw including all players. All Parties having Ministries in proposed
Governments must vote affirmatively for the proposed Government to be
formed. When scores are calculated, the point totals will be adjusted for
the relative size of each Party, so each point gained by Party 1 would be
divided by 8.2, each point gained by Party 2 would be divided by 7.5 and so
forth.

6. There are 615 seats in Parliament, so a Majority Government must have at
least 308 MPs. The number of seats held by each Party is shown in following
table:

Party: Number of Seats

A: 82
B: 75
C: 68
D: 61
E: 55
F: 49
G: 43
H: 38
I: 33
J: 28
K: 24
L: 20
M: 16
N: 13
O: 10

7. Proposed Governments submitted to the CM for a VoC should be submitted in
the following format:

Ministry: Party Controlling Ministry

PM: ______ Party
Def: ______ Party
Fin: ______ Party
For: ______ Party
Ag: ______ Party
E/C: ______ Party
Env: ______ Party
F/F: ______ Party
H/W: ______ Party
Inf: ______ Party
Jus: ______ Party
M/E: ______ Party
S/I: ______ Party
Sec: ______ Party
Tra: ______ Party
WP1 (if named): ______ Party
WP2 (if named): ______ Party
WP3 (if named): ______ Party
