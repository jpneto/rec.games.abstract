Actually I'd like to announce publicly I believe soft finitude
(practical finitude) is a real phenomenon. I see it in Arimaa for
instance which is a game I like quite a bit, it is the quintessential
alternative to Chess although I don't play anymore because I've pretty
much lost all knowledge of theory I had in that game but still I send
mad props to Arimaa. The thing is I don't see that Volo is a
practically finite game and I do see that "soft" finitude is being
used as sort of a copout phrase that presumes to know the behavior of
a game that has had very little data, if any, recorded on it.
Theoretical finitude is a useful concept, if you make a game
theoretically finite then you KNOW there will be no tedious cycles
during gameplay sessions. Even though practical finitude definitely
exists I'm not sure how useful it is as a concept given our current
limited understanding of how abstract games actually work. I think the
fact that Arimaa ended up being practically finite even at high level
play was really just dumb luck. That said, designing a game to be
practically finite is a good idea and there are definitely ways to
design practical finitude into a game. But what I see more and more
often is games being designed without practical finitude explicitly in
mind being called practically finite afterward without any data to
support this claim and in the case of Volo or Pylyx or whatever a
ruleset that doesn't even suggest soft finitude. Also superko will
make any game theoretically finite, so Go is "theoretically"
theoretically finite but the problem is superko expects too much
memorization on the part of players and to use it as an afterthought
is just bad craftsmanship. Maybe that's a matter of opinion because I
always hear how the superko status never becomes too complicated in
regular play in Go but how can we be sure players don't avoid creating
complex Ko situations just to avoid burdening themselves with the task
of memorizing the superko status of the board? Even if its a matter of
opinion its an opinion I hold strongly. Surely we can do better than
superko in this modern age...
