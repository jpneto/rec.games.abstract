Most board games have a noticeable advantage to the first player. Just recently
I mentioned a method of "equalizing the advantage" between the players, (or
rather removing the advantage), that I had posted about some time earlier.

My own favorite "equalization" technique is
to have the first player make one move and thereafter each player gets two
moves.  This doesn't apply to all board games, but it seems to work well with
Hex, simplified Go-Moku, and even Chess (with appropriate check-restrictions).

Yes, this is a fun system.  This is the simplest of the multi-move "transformers"
that myself and Michael Chisnall posted about, in some newsgroup or other, a
fair while ago. There are a great many other "transformers", that can apply to
almost any board game, such as the "misere" transformer, the "kriegspiel"
transformer, and so on.

The multi-move transformers are great fun, and more amenable to analysis than
many game transformers. The basic one, mentioned by Karl, is the 1-2-2-2-...
multimover, often first introduced as an attempt to reduce the first-move
advantage.  Another is the "progressive" multi-mover, 1-2-3-4-5-.... , which
has even been played in tournaments, for progressive chess; (by the way, did
the e-mail progressive chess tournament ever finish in good order? - last I
heard was about March 1993, only some partial results.) The progressive 
multimover is a lot of fun at "Go" too, and intimately linked to the topic of 
"hypercontrol", which has also been the subject of a long former thread on
rec.games.go . 

The trouble with the 1-2-2-2-2-...  multimove transformer, is that

(i) it leads to a quite different sort of game, for the most part; (though fun!);
(ii) it doesn't necessarily remove the first-move advantage, though it usually
     reduces it a lot, (though may somewhat <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>reverse<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it).

So:  EQUALIZATION:  To remove the first- (or second-) move advantage, while
                    leaving us playing essentially the same game.

My favorite method, which seems to work for almost all board games, is...

"3-move equalization"
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One player, the "Placer", plays a (legal) move for first-mover, then one for
second-mover, then another for first-mover. The other player, the "Chooser", 
then decides on the basis of the board state obtained, whether he wants to
be second-mover (and continue with the next move), or first-mover (and let his
opponent continue).

So the Placer is under some pressure to play three moves that leave "exactly"
equal chances, and the Chooser must try to find a flaw in this attempt. (The
question of who gets to be Chooser can be determined by lot; or in a match,
alternately).  This seems such a good method to me that I wonder it has never
been the rule in special tournaments. It would have the further advantage (e.g. 
in chess) that standard opening theory would not become quite so over-analysed.

For friendly games, one might object that, (just as in the cake-dividing
method of "you-cut-and-I'll-choose), there is still a (psychological at least)
advantage to being the Chooser; but such is the fun of trying to find an
appropriate 3-move start, that I bet there would never be any lack of volunteers
to be Placer.  And also, he could prepare some tricky traps, maybe !

----

Note that 3 seems to be the minimum number of moves that would lead to a
sensible equalization attempt, if it is to apply to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> board games. One can
see this by considering simplified go-moku, (5-in-a-row on an infinite board);
where clearly a 1-move or 2-move equalization attempt would be meaningless. 

However; for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, a 2-move or even 1-move equalization might be 
successful in equalizing the chances.  In particular, in both chess and go,
it is interesting to consider this.  Where would you play a first move, so
that your opponent could elect to be either 1st-mover or 2nd-mover, and you
would be equally happy with your chances either way ?

CHESS:  a3 ?    h3 ?   h4 ?   Na3 ?  (probably this last leaves white ahead).

GO:  3-2 ?   7-9 ?  2-2 ?  (This last one probably leaves black a little behind).

Anyway; whether or not 1-move equalization would work for chess and go, I'm
sure 3-move equalization would, and be a lot of fun too; <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>AND<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> leave the
game otherwise virtually unchanged.
