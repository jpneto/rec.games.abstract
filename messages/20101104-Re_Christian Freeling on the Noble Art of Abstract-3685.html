It's a two edged sword, actually. Like finding Symple, which certainly
wouldn't have been the case if the theme hadn't been discussed,
however reluctantly. But find it and it's held against you because you
didn't put in a lot of effort in it and didn't do a lot of playtesting
before publishing it. Because that's what game inventors must do,
according to those who aren't. And don't you dare to be different!

No, you don't have to. Not by me anyway. People have very different
approaches to designing games. Of the designers who have posted and
been talked about in this group, and who have pages promoting their
games.

* João Pedro Neto and Bill Taylor design(ed) lots and lots of games,
mostly variants. Toying with various concepts. Probably only
playtested by those two a handul of times each, then posted to their
(Bill's?) blog. This is fine, because they never said each and every
game had to leap fully formed from the Creator's head.
* Cameron Browne also has a high production, but he seems to start
with some rather novel idea (not a variant), implement it at pbmserv,
play it a lot with many different people, and revise it and make
variants until he's satisfied with it or comes up with something new.
Does not seem to crave genius worship either.
* Nick Bentley: according to himself, has hundreds of ideas, only
publishes a very few of them. So far, he's been enthusiastic for each
of these in turn, and done a bit to promote them, but it seems he gets
disillusioned with most of them eventually. Tweaks after publishing.
Another non-megalomaniac.
* Mark Steere: Really thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread.
Does not care about such boorish criteria as gameplay. You are only
allowed to criticize his games according to the platonic criteria he
had decided upon, which are drawlessness, finite play, and, uh, no
checker jumps (oops, wait! list is subject to revision according to
which competitors' games Mark is hating at the moment). Has admitted
to self-delusion as a strategy to help his games succeed.
* YOU! Well, why don't you fill it out yourself?

But I would take Mark's advice and do it at BGG. This forum is dead,
killed by Mark (he even talks to the porn spammers these days,
pretending his enemies sent them). Apparently we have been defeated,
and deserve it for not recognizing his genius. I say we leave him with
his lovely prize.
