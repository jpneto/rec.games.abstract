The game appears to be interesting. However, I would like to see a
much bigger board or do you intend to create another children's game?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

High praise from you!  Especially for a game with such obvious rules.

The game generalizes to any MxN board.  Without more experience
playing and "figuring it out" I don't know how M and N affect playability.
My intuition suggests 8x8 (really 8x15 if you measured it at the bottom)
is already nontrivial and 10x10 might be "tournament".  Of course, this
assumes the game isn't "solved" in short order...

(By the way, in my experience a motivated "child" can beat almost all
adults who after all have to worry about living.)

The next variant would allow a stone to be
placed at the same level as a friendly stone (2A).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think i just solved this variant for any board size.
Both players try to reach the central square(s) of the bottom-most row as
fast as possible. This results in a straight race of one flow by each
player. As soon the bottom is reached the players spread their stones to
one side of the board.
If the bottom-most row numbers an even number of squares the game is a
draw, otherwise it is a win for the second player because he is ahead in
the race.

Very good, thank you.  I will work on a fix.

A more chaotic variant
requires only adjacency to a stone of either color (2B), but a stone cut
off from receiving (downward or sideways) "flow" is immediately removed
(similar idea as Greg's).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pieces cannot move, right? This means that a stone cannot be cut off
from the "flow" except it is placed on a square where it is not connected
to the flow right from the beginning. However, it doesn't make sense in
this game to place a  stone on the board which is removed immediately.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I meant and should have written "potential" flow.  Hope this clarifies.

A black stone can be placed below white stones so that in theory it can
receive flow later -- but if white fenced it in (by playing above and to
both
sides of it for example) it may become a "dead" stone.  One can legitimately
ask whether it becomes dead as soon as it's fenced in, or only when there
is no possible further play (namely the elimination of stones above and to
the side of it) that can give it "life".  Let's take the simpler rule for
now --
capture is defined without consideration of future capture.  (There are
two different games here; let's call the other 2D.)  Example:

      x x x _ x    say black can capture three white stones by filling in _
    x o o o x
      o x o &lt;- does this white stone capture the black stone next to it?

Finally, stones can be placed anywhere (2C).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This makes no sense to me either. Could you please explain your idea?
What would be the goal of this game, etc. ???
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Let's say black placed stones in the bottom row while white filled in the
topmost playable row.  The black stones are eliminated and white wins
a shutout.  The game is actually Hex-like but with life and death defined
by possible connection to the row of origin.  It is quite possible that one
could prove mathematically that playing "higher" is always better -- then
the game is flawed and the rules should be rewritten.  (A simple rule
change would be to score all territory instead of just the bottom row.)

Except the first one, these are not games. These are just ideas of games.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

These are prototypes that need playtesting, as was requested.
At least the first one is clear :-)  At the conclusion of each of these
games, the following is true:  Each stone in the bottom row is connected
to the row of origin by a possibly meandering flow of friendly stones.
How many essentially different final configurations are possible?

Looking forward to further comments,
