Alas, the following extra rule is needed to make the game truly drawless:

---

A black (x) stone can't be removed if it's one of the two center stones in this pattern, its rotations or mirror images:

.. x x
x x .

("." points are irrelevant and can be empty or occupied by either player.)

Likewise, with colors reversed, for white stones.

---

However, without this rule, draws can only happen if the board fills up completely and there are at least three instances of the following 7-stone pattern (or its rotations, mirror images or negative images):

o x .
x x o
.. o x

Even then, I suspect that this only suffices to enable cooperative cycles. Some crosscuts in other parts of the board are probably needed to create a forced cycle. And that might not be enough yet. It seems logical to think that removing (effectively, flipping) stones in those other crosscuts will have a higher priority than removing (effectively, flipping) the central stone in any instances of the above 7-stone pattern, since the latter can be later undone by the opponent. If that is so, it would mean forced cycles are impossible, which would make the extra rule unnecessary.

This is of course no rigorous proof; if anyone out there has some insights on this, I'd love to hear them.
