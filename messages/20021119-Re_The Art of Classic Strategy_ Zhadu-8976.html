Although, I have not made the "official" announcement yet, with the
notation system, it is possible to play Zhadu through email and other
forms of correspondence. I can tell you personally, that an email game
adds a new dimension to the game and it's addicting.

If you or anyone else is interested before the "announcement" date, I
can send you the neccessary material. Also stay tuned, the free
monthly newsletter is on it's way which will include strategies,
hints, tips, analysis of some example games, etc.

Yes, I'm interested. I'd also like to support your work and compensate you
for your effort in creating and supporting the game. However until I find a
new job, I'm not going to be spending $60 or more on the game. If you sold a
$15 paper board &amp; plastic tokens version, I'd buy it. But since you don't,
I'd be happy to make a small donation through Paypal if you're set up to
receive such donations.

I think it'd be easy enough to come up with a notation on my own, but that
would be a bad idea unless a consensus forms that the standard notation
needs improvement. So please send me the specs of the standard notation so
that I don't muddy the waters with something ad hoc.

Thanks.

--&gt; Thank you for your sincere gesture. I am truly grateful. 
 I will contact you and send you the material.

Be well,
