Quite so.   As I outlined some days ago with my "NZ" post!

With considerably more accuracy, and examples shown.

No, Bill.  The problem that Torben identified in my earlier attempt
applies to your game as well.  I'll translate it for you in a way that
applies specifically to your game.

In your game N wins if he forms an N-S loop, and Z wins if he forms an
E-W loop.  In the case that neither player achieves his loop goal and
instead there are two helices, N wins if there is a negative gradient
and Z wins if there is a positive gradient.

The problem is that if Z makes an N-S loop <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a helix with a
negative gradient, he hasn't achieved either of his goals but he
prevents N from achieving either of his.  Now (picking up where Torben
left off) if N makes a negative gradient line connecting N to S (not a
loop), Z will be unable to form either an E-W loop or a positive
gradient helix.  Now neither player can win.

Try to keep up with the discussion.

Oh and one more thing.  And I quote:

"OC it would be possible to play a similar game on a hexagonal-gridded
torus, but it would not be able to have isomporphically tasked winning
criteria - so it could never be a "fair" game, as is quadric NZ."

My new game, which is different from your game, and which doesn't have
the problem that Torben identified, is played on a hexagonally
tessellated grid. <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>And<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> my game has the property that a filled board
produces exactly one winner.

Any questions?
