back in the year 1992 or 1993,  i had a very amusing pc game. it was
probably one of the first virtual reality games for the pc. it was very
abstract and did not have much of a point. the goal of the game was to
navigate a "ship" or rather a triangular shape in a 3-d world that very
much resembled the movie "the cube".  the audio track on the game was
very pleasant and trippy. the game was made by european makers and was
called "alpha something something" i can't remember the title for the
life of me. if someone knows what i'm talking about and could either
tell me what the full title is or where i could find this game i would
be highly appreciative.
