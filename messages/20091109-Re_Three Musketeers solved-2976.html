I couldn't care less what seems like a good idea to dime-a-dozen

So use a 3x5 board.  That's a commonly used variation that I don't
mind.  Different board sizes that don't change the nature of the game
are fine with me.  For Cephalopod this means odd sized boards that
keep the game draw free.

If you have an idea for a variant, have the common decency to run it
past me first.  Don't post a fucked up, trademark damaging variant to
the Internet while never having consulted me about it, and then when I
stumble onto it tell me, "I believe that all can come from this is to
bring more attention and success to your great game."  Don't bring
your variant up for discussion in a public forum, like you're doing
here, instead of contacting me about it.  Here you have all these
ideas about Cephalopod and I don't hear word one about it until I read
it here at this end-of-the-world den of mediocrity,
rec.games.abstract, where your initial focus is my lack of playing
skill.  (How many hats to I have to wear?)  Is it really that
demeaning to consult a designer about his game?  I don't get it.

Here's a quote from my "A Designer's Perspective"
 (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Design_Perspective.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Design_Perspective.html</a>):

"In summary, leave the abstract game design to the abstract game
designer.  Doesnt that seem reasonable?  When a programmer presumes
to involve himself with the rules of my game, he firmly establishes a
few things: First and foremost the sheer oafishness that goes along
with wantonly abusing someone elses property.  A close second is the
audacity.  Here we had a programmer, whose only prior involvement with
abstract game design had been selecting pretty colors for the board
and pieces.  And now he suddenly felt empowered to take over the
design of a world class game.  Why?  Finally its the insult  the
implication that your game is so uninspired and arbitrary that Aldo
Asshole can jump in and make a worthwhile design contribution."

You weren't the first to program Cephalopod and you aren't the first
to suggest a variant for it.  There's a Zillions Cephalopod program by
Keith Carter that includes a 2-sided dice, 11x11 board variant.  Keith
had the common decency to ask me about the variant first which I then
approved.  Two-sided dice makes for very different, very interesting
gameplay.  I initially chose 6-sided dice because my games are
designed primarily for real life play and 6-sided dice are commonly
available.

I don't have a problem with variants.  I have a problem with self-
entitled "designers" running off with my game like a mangy dog with a
scrap of meat.
