A few years ago this was a thread on rec.games.go whether 
and how Go could be defined. I summarize and add newer
insights:

TRADITION

If a game has a traditional background of being played by
humans, then it is likely to meet people that insist that
the variant used by them is the one and only one.

MANKIND

One may observe all those variants played by the world-wide 
Go playing community that are recognized by their bodies
(associations, federations, etc.). One may then accept that
all such variants are Go.

VARIANTS

It is easy to introduce many variants that resemble Go
somehow but that would never be accepted by Go bodies. E.g.
besides other things one could call anything Go that is 
related to a mathematical relation.

DEFINITION

One can go ahead and <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>define<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (some variant of) Go 
mathematically.

RULES STUDY

It is possible to study all rules (whether verbal, official,
variants, mathematical, etc.), compare their strategic 
behaviours, and make general assertions for all of them to 
derive a description of essential characteristics of Go.
This results in the following:

CHARACTERIZATION

1) Go is a game.
2) There are two players.
3) It is valid to describe the playing material as a 19x19
grid, black stones used by one player, and white stones 
used by the other player, to describe the game start as an
empty grid and the player with the black stones having the 
first turn, and to assign a played stone to a grid intersection.
4) The players have alternate turns to perform a move.
5) If there is a condition for ending alternation that is
not a winning condition, then a score determines the winner.
6) There is a relation that assigns some stones on the grid
the characteristic "surrounded".
7) There is a move type called play.
8) After a play no stone on the grid is surrounded.
9) A play requires the player performing it to put one own
stone on an empty intersection and then to remove any 
surrounded opposing stones from the grid.
10) The empty intersections a stone may be played on are 
restricted.
11) If a score determines the winner, then it is a function
mapping distributions of stones on the grid on a set of
numbers.

ESSENTIALS

A crude selection of crucial points from the list above is:
- Plays provide variation for stones on a grid.
- Restrictions restrict variation of plays.
- Scoring depends on a final distribution of stones on a grid.
