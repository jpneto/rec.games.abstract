SW Horse #3
Red 57 cannon S3+1 variation

Before 1970's, Black always play S7+1 in move #3 as it has not found a
solution to Red's S3+1 variation. However, all that changed in the 70's and
since then, Black can cope with Red's S7+1 or S3+1 variation.

Both sides move their Assistants to consolidate their defences.

Option 1
10 R2+8  to threaten Black's 7th Horse. The success or failure of this
opening will depend on Black's ability to counter this threat. If Red R2+6
C2+1 

10 ...    C21
11 R8+5   If R84? R4+7; R23 H3+4; R4+1 S3+1!; S7+1 H4+2; Black could
sacrifice 7th Horse in exchange for attack on Red's left wing.

11 ...    H3-2
12 R23    R4+5!

If 13.  Red R3-1? C6+5  after exchange Black's pieces are in better position
to attack Red's left wing. Hence Black's opening is successful.


Option 2
10 S9+1   C21
11 R84   If R8+5   H3-2; C5+4  C6+7!; G54 H7+5; R2+6  R4+4 Black loses
soldiers but its pieces are more active.

11 ...    R4+7
12 C56  If C76? S3+1!; R47 (If S7+1 H3+4; followed by C13 threat) C1-1
threatening Red's 7th file by C13

12 ...    S1+1
13 S9+1   C1+5
14 C69    H3+4  Black Horse attacking Red Rook and also threatening R2+7!

Option 3
10 H3+4   C6+2
11 C53    attacking Black 7th Horse
11 ...    C21 (If H3+2; R85)
12 R85    R4+3  threatening Red Rook by S5+1
13 S9+1   S5+1
14 R58    R4-1!  If R2+5?; H4+6 R2-3; H6+7  C13; R2+6 Red open up Black 7th
rank.

15 R2+6   R2+5
16 H9+8   R4+2
17 H8+7   C1+3

Both sides have attacking chances.


Conclusions: Of the 3 options, Red 3rd option is the best as it can deal
with Black's counter-attacks the most effectively. In this opening, we saw
that the more aggressive Red's threat to Black's 7th Horse, the stronger is
Black's counter attack on Red 7th file.
