Or maybe even an endless hunt?  My anticipation was that Cyclix might end up
being a little more cyclic than hoped.  Cyclix is a different game from
Monkey Queen but defensive play can occur in Monkey Queen as well. 
Gamer-man (Alex) is an expert Shogi player and he can either beat me at
Monkey Queen with balls out aggressive play or by building a fortress for
his queen hide behind.

When there's a fortress, you really need Monkey Queen to be finite.  At the
outset, 20 checkers is plenty to distribute babies all over the board.  But
if the board becomes saturated with babies, a couple of baby fights break
out, and a few checkmate attempts are made to no avail, you still need the
game to end.

The finitude in Monkey Queen comes into play well before your queen stack
wears down to two checkers.  When your queen stack has around seven
checkers, for example, you might start to become more conservative with
wasteful, baby generating, non-aggressive queen moves.  You tend to move
your babies whenever you can in this phase, aggressively or
non-aggressively, to conserve your remaining non-aggressive queen moves.

The grind or the finitude (or hard finitude as you might call it, Christian)
is part of the game.  It's like a car race where you're only allowed so much
gasoline (a realistic possibility) and you have to go as fast as you can
while keeping economy of gas consumption in mind.  In Monkey Queen you have
to keep economy of baby production in mind.  A 20 checker queen can produce
18 babies.  Use them wisely.

I'm kind of luxuriating with Monkey Queen because it's very fantabulous. 
I'm getting extreme compliments.  "Like it more than Amazons", etc.

I, hunter, lucked out with Monkey Queen for two reasons.
  1. You can't be expected to create a way above average game for a contest.
   More likely it will be average among your games, with a decent chance of
  being a little below (or above) average.  Monkey Queen is proving to be
  one of my very best, I believe, but more weeks and months of play will be
  needed for the strategy to really establish itself.
  2. Were it not for all the feedback calling for an improvement to Monkey
  Queen, which feedback probably would not have been issued without the
  structure of the contest, I wouldn't have empowered the babies with more
  aggressive queen-like movement, creating a richer, more offensive
  gameplay.  Someone described the current incarnation of Monkey Queen as
  "too aggressive for my blood", the perfect compliment.

This whole discussion kind of highlights why I make my games finite. 
Players will find a way to "cause trouble" for your game if there's any
possible way to do so, especially if they're Chess variants with a
combinatorial flavor.  Shogi succeeds where Chess fails because of the
increased complexity.  With decreased complexity, the opposite occurs. 
Draws will find a way in decreased complexity, non-finite Chess variants.
