rec.games.abstract is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its vote for
creation by 287:64 as reported in news.announce.newgroups on 2 Nov 1992.

For your newsgroups file:
rec.games.abstract      Perfect information, pure strategy games.

The charter, culled from the call for votes:

        The newsgroup would be for discussion of abstract games where
        strategy, tactics and player skill are paramount.  This includes
        the major category of perfect information, pure-strategy
        (deterministic) games, i.e. those with no element of chance (e.g.
        no dice), and where all information is available (unlike card games
        and Scrabble, for example, where players' hands are hidden).  The
        games under consideration are characterised by a simple board and
        pieces, with a small number of rules.  The cliche `a minute to
        learn, a lifetime to master' is often applied.

        o       discussion of less mainstream abstract games,
                which do not warrant a group of their own.

        o       design and implementation issues for computer players.

        o       develop generic code for computer programs,
                such as board widgets, alpha-beta and other algorithms.

        o       introduce each other to new games, thus finding new
                opponents.

        o       discuss strategy &amp; tactics for human players.

        o       what makes a {good,fun,hard,popular} abstract game?
                Will playing X be detrimental/beneficial to my Y playing? etc.

        o       ask `experts' for rule clarification.

        o       catalogue known abstract games, variations, genealogy,
                sources of equipment, literature, clubs.

        o       maintain a list of email opponents for various games.

        o       catalogue available computer programs for these games.

        o       maintain a FAQ, outriggers could be posted to other groups,
                get a mention in appropriate FAQs.

        o       propose and discuss new games or mechanisms

        o       puzzles for games other than chess et al.

        o       organise tournaments for various (obscure) games.

        o       organise an ftp archive, where useful information and games
                programs can be held.

        o       vote for the best and the worst abstract game of the year
                (or month or ever!)

        o       generally have fun in a decent way
