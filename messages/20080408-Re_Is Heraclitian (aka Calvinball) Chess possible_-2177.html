A Heraclitus (aka Calvinball) tournament would consist of this being
unique for each game.  During the tournament, a limited set of games,
each game has a different set of rules.  This is a practical
application of the whole Heraclitus chess approach.

The question then is:  Is Heraclitian (aka Calvinball) Chess
possible?  Doesn't mean that most of the games people would play of it
would be good, just if it is possible or not.  Then the question
becomes how many restrictions can be placed on it to improve quality,
and still have it be Heraclitian.

I would think that each variant should be used twice - once for one
player as White, once as Black, for a series of two games between two
players. Just like the openings drawn in Checkers.

Since I am not discussing whether or not one could have a near-
infinite number of variants of Chess, I've removed sci.math.

But my version, on the 12 by 8 board, offers up to 16,200 variants -
all tidy and symmetrical like normal Chess, so it might meet this
particular goal.
