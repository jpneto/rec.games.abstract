I have a habit of trying to get rid of move-restrictions, so I just
came up with the following possible modification:

There are no move restrictions. A player may create an even number of
groups with his move.
There's an off-board token, called a Gollum (why not?)
If there is an even number of groups on board at the end of your turn,
you take ownership of the Gollum

That's an interesting variant. However, I think the ban on parity is a
more straightforward approach, and one which defines the very
character of the game, as both Christian and you have already noted.

introduces an extraneous element which does little more than serve its
prosaic purpose of avoiding draws. It doesn't enhance tactics or
strategy, yet players must take it into account at every moment.

But don't get me wrong: I'm glad that Yodd has intrigued you to the
extent of thinking of a plausible variant. I must admit that it had
never crossed my mind!
