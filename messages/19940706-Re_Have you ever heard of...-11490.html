There are at least two other games I know of which revolve around making 
up rules for subsequent moves: the board-game LEMMA and the word game 
WORD LEMMA. 

Lemma consisted of a board with a complex geometric design (consisting of 
imbedded squares and probably other shapes-- more complex than the 
Kennsington board) in various colors and three sets of wooden tokens, 
colored on one side and blank on the other. Each player in turn 
formulated a rule for the placement or movement of tokens on the board, 
and then placed or moved a token, obeying that rule and all previous 
rules. The last player to be able to make a move won the game.

Word Lemma is very similar, except played without a board. The rules 
dictate the formulation of rules; the last person to state a rule which 
obeys itself and all previous rules wins. This gets very difficult very 
quickly; in the one game I played of it, rule #4 dictated that all rules 
must rhyme, and rule #5 was something to the effect of:

	"That which does not kill us makes us stronger
	 So to make this game last not much longer
	 I think that it would be just peachy
	 If every rule had to quote from Nietzsche."

It went downhill fast from there.
