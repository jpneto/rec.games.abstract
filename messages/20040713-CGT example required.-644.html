Considering games of the "Winning Ways" style, does anyone know of,
or can anyone please construct, an example of this type:


-----------------------
That there are three symmetric games, A, B, C, all of type "1st-player wins",
(i.e. games whose values are "confused with zero", i.e. "hot-position" games),
and with the property that -

1) in game  A + B, the only winning strategies require starting in subgame A,

2) in game  A + C, the only winning strategies require starting in subgame C,

3) in game  C + B, the only winning strategies require starting in subgame B.
-----------------------


Informally, A is more urgent to play in than B, but B more than C, &amp; C than A.

It would be good even to have non-symmetric subgames A, B, C, though that
is a nastier case in that there are more than three subcases to consider, 
as it also requires attention as to who moves first.

But a symmetric solution, as mentioned above, would be super-cool.

I can't see any theoretical reason why it couldn't occur, but all my
attempts to construct a case come tantalisingly close, but just fail.

Help please!

Girls are better than boys at video games, because girls have larger 'buttons'.
Boys are only good at vintage games, because these are controlled by joysticks.
