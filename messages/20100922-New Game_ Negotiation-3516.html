Hi,

a few weeks ago I invented Negotiation.

Negotiation is a game of replacement, where you have to donate
something to your opponent for ensuring the winning. In each turn you
have to negotiate your move with the opponent.

Your move consists in replacing one opponent stone and placing three
stones. At the end the player with the largest group of stones wins.
This simple mechanics cause an interesting negotiation gameplay.

Rules:

The game begins with an empty 8x8x8 (or more) hex-hex board.

One of the players uses black stones and the other player uses white
stones. Players move alternately, starting with black player.

In his turn the player replaces 1 of the opponent stones placed in the
last turn (not the replaced one) with his own, and place 3 own stones.

Exceptions: in the first turn the black player places just 3 stones;
in the last turn black replaces just one of the last white stones and
the game is over.

(The pie rule can be used.)

When at the end of the white turn the board has just 1 empty cell, the
last turn starts. The game ends with an unoccupied cell. When the game
is finished, the player with the largest group of stones wins. If both
players have the same score, the winner is the player with less number
of groups.


This is Negotiation. Im interested in listening your opinions. Most
importantly Im interested in finding some opponents for testing more
this game. You can find me on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com">www.iggamecenter.com</a> (user: epicurus),
there we can use the Sandbox. :)
