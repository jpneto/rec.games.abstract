I wonder what might be an appropriate board for a connection game

Is it possible to fulfill the following condition?

  then <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exactly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one player has a winning connection.

You can, certainly, define patalogical games that fulful this: Imagine
a graph consisting of N+1 vertices such that vertices 1 to N are all
connected to vertex 0, but no other connections exist.  The nodes are
like spokes in a wheel with vertex 0 as the nave. Assume, also, that
nodes 1-3 are pre-coloured in colours 1-3 and all other nodes are
empty.  A winning connection is one that connects node 0 to any other
node.  Clearly, a completely coloured graph will have exactly one
winning colour.

This isn't very interesting, so let us try for some general results.

Assumptions:

Let us assume that the game uses pieces of different colours, and that
a player need to make a connection made entirely of his own colour to
win.  Furthermore, the fact that a connection is winning must depend
only on the nodes in that connection and not on the colours of nodes
outside that connection.  Thirdly, we assume that the precoloured
nodes aren't enough to establish a winning connection for one of the
colours.

Lemma 1.

A board that fulfils the unique-win condition with three colours must
also fulfil the unique-win condition with two colours (since a
possible colouring can omit one colour entirely).  Generally, the
unique-win condition with N colours implies the unique-win condition
with M colours for all 0&lt;M&lt;N.

Lemma 2.

Let us call a winning connection minimal if no node in the connection
can be recoloured to another colour while keeping it a winning
connection.  Clearly, in any game that has winning conditions, there
exist minimal winning connections, as we can repeatedly recolour nodes
in the winning connection until no more can be recoloured.

Let us assume we have a three-player game with the unique-win property
and let us further assume we have a filled game using only two colours
(A and B) (apart from precoloured nodes) such that colour A has a
minimal winning connection.  Now, let us pick any node in the the
winning connection and recolour it to the third colour C.  Since the
game has the unique-win property, the new configuration must have a
winning connection.  This can't be with colour A, since this was
minimal and we have recoloured one node from it and hence turned it
into a non-winning connection.  Neither can it be from colour B, since
we have added no B-coloured node and there was no winning connection
before.  Hence, the winning connection must be of colour C.  This
means that there exist winning connections (for colour C) that consist
of only one node in addition to precoloured nodes.


Theorem.

In a three-player game with the above asssumptions, there exist
winning connections that consist of only one node in addition to any
precoloured nodes.

As such games aren't very interesting, we can conclude that there
doesn't exist interesting three-player connection games that obey the
basic assumptions above.
