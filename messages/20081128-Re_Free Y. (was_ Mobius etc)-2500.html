Absolutely.  Joao Neto and I, who design and play a large number

I saw your game, Gem, which is played on a pentagonal board, in
Cameron Browne's "Connection Games".  It's a nice, simple rule set.
One thing that occurred to me though is that the goal of connecting
two adjacent sides and one of their opposite sides is sufficient.  The
alternate goal of connecting four sides seems to be redundant since if
you've done that then you've also achieved the first goal.

Your Projex is certainly noteworthy as well, on a number of levels, as
is your Free Y.  I'd be interested in any other games you have in this
category.

As an example, you haven't even mentioned "Free Y", which I've
posted on this newsgroup before.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm pretty sure we've discussed Free Y here before - maybe when I
released Begird (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf</a>), a
generalization of Y. One special case of Begird is equivalent to Free
Y, which is referred to as Begird-27 in the rule sheet.  I remember
your description of the winning condition.  I usually like your
description of a concept better than my own description of the same
concept.

IMHO this may turn out to be
the MOST CANONICAL of all the planar connection games.
.........
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course I'm biased but I'd make a case for Lariat being the most
canonical.  Lariat has a lariat shape and Free Y has a Y shape.  Not a
great deal of difference in complexity between the two shapes you have
to form.  But in Lariat you don't need an odd number of border cells,
and there's no measurement of distance between pairs of border cells.
There's only one border cell in the winning path.

The ULTIMATE hex-connection game, with THE most canonical goal,
is (IMHO) Projex:-  played on a projective plane, with goal merely
to make a global loop.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That is a nice, elegant goal, but the board - I personally wouldn't
call it canonical.  Yes, as you say, it has no corners or edges, but
its graphical representation does have corners and edges - edges that
can be crossed and recrossed in a bewildering array of convoluted
possibilities.  I'm not picking on your game.  It's a cool game.  But
overall I wouldn't include it among the most canonical.

The board has NO corners OR edges!
However, most folk (apart from mathies) don't like playing on
non-planar topology boards.  Hence...

- just a bunch of quirky projective plane games.

...this comment is fairly well justified, sadly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

By the way, I'm developing my first themed game.  People have
suggested I give it a try a few times over the years so...  It's not
really my thing but then again I'm having a lot of fun with it.  I'll
make an OT mention of it here if I do end up releasing it.
