Oops, I forgot to tell a little rule: when a surrounded territory is
created, if there is the same number of Black and White stones
adjacent to it, the territory will be filled with stones of the player
who has NOT created said surrounded territory.

By the way, and just for the record, I'm beginning to think that the
rather tricky variant I suggested in my first post is actually better
than the original idea. But, because both empty and occupied points
can be part of surrounded territories, situations will arise in which
the player can mentally draw several different limits to some
territories. Therefore, it must be stated that: for the purpose of
filling a surrounded territory, if a stone can be considered to be
both a part of that territory and a limit to it, it will be considered
to be a part of it.

I know this is all a bit confusing. I'll try to post some text-based
diagrams if I manage to get enough time for it.
