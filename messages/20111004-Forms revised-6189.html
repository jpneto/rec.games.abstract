Hello all,

Forms has been revised; the tactics are more focused and the strategy
is deeper.  Here are the rules:


The game can be played on an m by n board where n is even.  The set up
is a full interspersed board, as in the game Clobber.

e.g. a 4 by 4 board:

BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
WBWB

The game is misere rather than regular.  As you know, this means that
the last person to move <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>loses<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  This turns out to be crucial to
making Forms work..  You win by forcing your opponent to capture all
of your pieces.

On your turn you can and must do exactly one of the following two
things:

1) capture an adjacent opponent's piece by replacement (You'll note
that this is again the same as Clobber.)

2) execute a "topologically invariant orthogonal slide" to an empty
space.  This mouthful is actually an easy concept to grasp
intuitively.  It basically means that you slide (via orthogonally
adjacent empty spaces) as far as you want, combining any number of
changes of direction that you want, such that you land on an empty
space.  Here's an illustration (E stands for empty space):

WBEE
EBEE
EWEE
BWWE

Among the possible moves, the uppermost black piece may slide to the
lowermost rightmost empty space, resulting in this position:

EEEE
EBEE
EWEE
BWWB

Why the uppermost leftmost white piece is now missing will be
explained shortly.

When executing a type 1 move or a type 2 move, any pieces *of either
or both sides* that are no longer connected to the orthogonally
connected group (as reckoned by pieces of either or both sides) that
the stone involved now belongs to, are removed from the board and are
out of play, being effectively captured.  A type 1 move --- an
adjacent replacement capture of an opponent's piece --- can but does
not have to remove an additional piece or pieces of either side. A
type 2 move --- a slide to an empty space --- <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> remove one or
more pieces of either or both sides.  In the diagram above where the
black piece has slid to the lowermost rightmost empty space, the
uppermost leftmost white piece is now no longer part of the
orthogonally connected group to which the slid black piece now
belongs.  Note that in such a removal (whether by a type 1 move or a
type 2 move) the question of disconnection is reckoned <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the
move is completed. Temporary disconnection during the move does not
result is removal.  For example:

EEEE
EEEE
WWEE
BEEE

Suppose the leftmost white stone slides to the empty space just to the
right of the other white stone.  (This results in immediate loss, but
never mind that.)  Only the black stone is removed. The other white
stone stays because it was only temporarily disconnected from the
sliding stone during the move.  After the move it is still connected
and therefore remains.

I'd be interested to know what people think of it if they get the
chance to try it.

Thanks,

Steve
