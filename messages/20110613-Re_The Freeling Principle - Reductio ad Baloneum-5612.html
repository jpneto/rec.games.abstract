Christian Freeling: "I designed this non-gravity challenged bicycle."

One possible rational response: "This shit is anti-gravity?"

Christian Freeling: "Oh no, that's not what I said.  You're putting words in
my mouth.  I merely described it as being non-gravity challenged."

OPRR: "Ok, Christian, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that your
bicycle is 'non-gravity challenged', whatever that means.  It's just that...
it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>looks<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> like an ordinary, slightly used bicycle with most of the paint
sandpapered off."

Christian Freeling: "Ordinary brands of bicycles, such as Trek, are gravity
challenged.  The weight of the bicycle itself combined with your fat ass
sitting on it will keep you grounded, permanently - unless you build up
speed and go over a ramp or something.  You'll certainly never soar like ET.
 The difference with my bicycle is that it's non-gravity challenged."

OPRR: "Ok, so you're essentially claiming that this bicycle is magical."

Christian Freeling: "No, I never said it was 'magical', you imbecile.  Quite
the opposite, in fact.  My bicycle is no more magical than any other
bicycle.  It's just non-gravity challenged.  Stop putting words in my mouth.
 All you ever do is put words in my mouth..."
