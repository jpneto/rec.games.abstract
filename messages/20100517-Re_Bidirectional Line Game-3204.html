The line may pass through itself (the colors of the segments at the
intersection not mattering). (Example: Two older consecutive vertical
segments are conjoined at a vertex. Then later on, a newer line
segment comes from the left and meets at that vertex, then the lastly
drawn of these four segments proceeds from the vertex rightward.)

The line may also "bounce" off of a corner, making a new corner (again
the colors of the segments not mattering). (Example: An older segment
proceeds upwardly to a vertex, then the next older segment proceeds to
the right. Then later on, a newer segment comes from the left to meet
at that vertex, and finally the last segment is drawn upwardly from
that vertex.)

By "colors of the segments not mattering", of course I mean that the
two older segments will be the same color, and the two newer segments
will be the same color. But the older segments may or may not be the
same color as the newer segments.

Thanks,
