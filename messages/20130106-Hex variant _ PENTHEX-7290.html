Instead of using stones my variant uses pentominoes.
I will let Markrappy who is an "Hex expert" give you the rules.
Cephalopd works like a Go game :
1. You drop die instead of stones. So you can create 1000 games where dropping is the first step.  
2. You capture other die instead of capturing stones. You can create 1000 games with 100`s capturing systems.
3. When the board is filled you count like Go.

So what is really new in Cephalopod???? Nothing.
It is a bad clone of Go with less depth and less sophistication.

More than that the game is solvable computationaly.
Any programmer little bit expert in parallel programming can do it in 10 hours of work.
Strategic !!!!????????? ha ha ha (MON CUL!!!)
When I read the Bentley article (another fake designer) I knew that this guy has no knowledge either in Mathematics or Programming.
Are you aware that you are lying to yourselves?
A game played by few (less than 50 people) will never show its weakness.
