Gert, thanks again for mentioning the slowness problem.  I had kind of
noticed it myself but just dismissed it as a minor, sucky thing about the
game.  Your critique spurred me to action and the problem was easily fixed.
Monkey Queen gameplay is hugely improved on the smaller 6x6 board.  It's
more fighty and less racy.  No more cross-board trekking.

Monkey Queen is very 'size dependent'. That's not always a limitation,
it can be a guideline, as it is in MQ. What worried me was Gert's
suggestion to 'fix' the problem. The step towards an arbitrary move
(two steps) would corrupt the concept. In this case, babies moving one
square feels 'natural', turbo charging them does not.

Not that I thought for one moment that you'd consider this 'solution',
I merely post this because it is a mistake that is often too lightly
made by inventors: starting to tamper with a concept before thinking
it through thouroughly. As always: if the concept is sound, the rule
will be there. In this case the badies just needed a cradle of a size
that would fit their behaviour.

No offence Gert, but that was a bit of a 'lazy' suggestion, not quite
fitting a beautiful concept.
