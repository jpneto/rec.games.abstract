Here is a simple game for any plural number of players.

This game is played on an m-by-m grid drawn on paper.

The first player to move places a 1 in any square of the grid.

Players thereafter take turns, each player placing the integer k in a
square adjacent to (and in the direction of above, below, right of, or
left of -- with restrictions {see below}) the square where the
previous player to move wrote the integer (k-1). (k increases:
1,2,3,4,5,...)

A player may put the integer in an empty square OR may write the
integer in a square that already has a single number in it -- but may
not write a number in a square that already has two numbers written in
it.

Nice concept.  The snake gets a dramatically improved life expectancy
(I'm guessing) since it can cross over itself (at least to a height of
2) and avoid dead ending.

A player may also not write a number in the square previously written
in by the player who moved before the last player to move.
(In other words: No U-turns. Any integer k cannot be placed in the
same square as the integer (k-2).)

A player who writes the second number in a square gets {the absolute
difference between the two numbers in the square} added to his/her
score.

The game continues until no more moves can be made.

Highest score wins, of course.

The anticlimactic, "fizzle out" game ending: Play ends when there are
no more moves and high score wins.  Yuck.  When you get a good
concept, take the next step and make a good game.  I think you can do
better.

You could simply end the game after the first player reaches a
predetermined score. Maybe that is too simple a fix, but I am mentally
tired right now.

You could, now that I think a little, end the game when the first
player reaches a score that is exactly a number that fits into a
certain class, such as, the game ends as soon as a player gets a score
that is a factorial. The problem with this approach is that neither
player may obtain the magic type of number until there are no more
moves possible anyway. The trick would be finding the correct class of
number. In any case, we can end the game with a "whichever comes first
-- no more moves possible, OR a score that is a ____"-rule.
