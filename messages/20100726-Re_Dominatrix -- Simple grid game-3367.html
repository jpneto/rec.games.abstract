Game. Any plural number of players. n-by-n grid. (I suggest for a 2-
player game an n of about 4 to 6 for beginners.)

The first player to move puts an x in any square.

The players take turns. (The player who last drew an x is player A.
The player who is now choosing where to put an x is player B.)
After player A draws an x, she then tells player B how many squares
from player A's recent x that player B can put his x. (This distance
is k squares.)
Player B then chooses a direction (up, down, right, or left-- whatever
is possible, given the edges of the grid) from player A's x that he
shall put the new x.
Player B can only put an x in an empty square. And this x must be the
number (k) of squares dictated by player A from player A's last x (as
I already said).
And, if possible, player A MUST dictate the distance (k) to an empty
square from her x.

Last player able to move is the winner.

So, to be the last player, you want to move into an empty square that
is the last empty square in that column and row.

I actually played this game with someone else. (I admit, I hardly ever
play my games with other people before publishing them. I have a hard
time finding people willing to play.)

For novices, I found, the game goes along without too much use of
strategy until the last few moves.
I would guess that if the players are more advanced, then strategy
would come in sooner. But maybe not. Maybe, maybe, it doesn't really
matter how good you are until the last few moves.

And, duh, to be clear, the players take turns who is player A and who
is player B.
