So it was a good idea, early in the game, to aim for the 20
sector, which has 19 and 17 alongside, so that if one were
a merely passable dart player one could hit one of those and
keep it, being prime.  Rather than risk going on and destroying
it down to a 3 or even 2 !

19 and 17 are alongside 3. 20 has 5 and 1 alongside.

Oh damn and blast - quite right.  So, I meant, you aim at the 3
and hope not to hit it, but to hit a 17 or 19.  (If you hit the 3
despite yourself you still have 2 darts to augment it.)

I'd want to play first (and last). Did you see a noticable bias?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In the related game we tried, it didn't seem to matter a lot
who played first, but last play was an advantage if there
were spare numbers to choose from, but a disadvantage
if there weren't.

Not much in it though.
