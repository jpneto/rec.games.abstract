Taking a step back, I'll start by summarising Hex:

 1. The game is played by two players on a board which is an NxN
    rhombic hex grid.

 2. The object of one player (Black) is to create a connection between
    the top and bottom edges using black pieces.  The object of the
    other player (White) is to connect the left and right edges using
    white pieces.  The edges are usually precoloured to show which
    edges each player need to connect.

 3. Moves are taken in turn by the two players until one wins.  A move
    consists of placing a pice of your own colour in any empty hex.

It can be shown that there is always a unique winner because any
filled board will obey the winning criteria of exactly one of the two
players.  We will call this the unique winner property.

Atoll changes Hex by the following:

 1. Changing the shape of the board.

 2. Introducing 4N precoloured segments on the edge.

 3. Changing the winning criteria so a player must connect any pair of
    opposite segments of his colour by pieces of his colour.

Y changes Hex by the following:

 1. Changing the shape of the board to a triangle.

 2. Changing the winning criteria so a player must connect all three
    sides of the triangle with pieces of his colour.

Both games have the unique-winner property.

You can generalise both by the following class of games:

 1. The board is a finite hex grid of any shape.

 2. Certain hexes can be numbered.

 3. Players take turn placing a piece of their colour in any empty,
    unnumbered hex.

 4. Each player has a finite pre-specified set of sets of numbers.

 5. Winning is done by having a connected group of pieces of the
    player's colour such that the group touches hexes of all the
    numbers in any of the player's set of numbers.

 6. The game has the unique-winner property.

You can instantiate this to Hex by choosing a rhombic grid and
numbering the edge hexes by numbers that identify the edges, i.e.,
1,2,3,4 clockwise.  Black's sets are {{1,3}} and White's sets are
{{2,4}}.

You can instantiate this to Atoll by choosing an allowed Atoll board
shape, numbering 2N segments of hexes by the numbers 1,2,...,4N
clockwise.  Black's sets are {{1,2N+1},{3,2N+3},...{2N-1,4N-1}} and
White's sets are {{2,2N+2},{4,2N+4},...{2N,4N}}.

You can instantiate this to Y by numbering the edge hexes (excluding
the corners) with the numbers 1, 2 and 3.  Both players have the sets
{{1,2,3}}.

So this class of games generalises both Hex, Atoll and Y.

Note that I have put the unique-winner property as a requirement for
each game in the class, as you can easily define games with properties
1-5 that don't have this property.

To show that there exists games other than Atoll and Y in this set,
here is an example:

 1. The board is a hexagon.

 2. The center hex is numbered 1, and the edge hexes are all numbered
    2.

 3. All other hexes have their own unique number.

 4. Black has the sets {{1,2}}.  White has all sets that describe a
    closed loop around the center hex.  This is a large, but finite
    set of sets.

This has the unique-winner property.  Proof:

  At most one: A loop around the center and a path from the center to
  the edge will, obviously, cross.  (And, this time, there is no
  mistake in this reasoning).

  At least one: Assume you have a black path from center to edge.
  Replacing part of this path by white pieces such that these do not
  touch white pieces already on the board will not cut the path in
  two.  Assume, conversely, that you have a closed white loop.
  Replacing parts of this by black pieces that do not tough black
  pieces already on the board will not break the loop.  Hence,
  according to the proof I made in an earlier posting, there will be
  at least one winner.

You might not like that I changed the unique-winner property from a
consequence of the other rules to an explicit requirement, but that
doesn't change that the above defines a class of games that generalise
Hex, Atoll, Y and other similar games.
