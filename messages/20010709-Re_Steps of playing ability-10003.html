Furthermore, I doubt that there's any meaningful concept of the
difficulty of a game per se, not regarding the human players.
Mathematically, there are for full-information, two-player non-random
games just two kinds of plays: The correct ones (that conform to the
winning strategy) and the incorrect ones.

In practice,  this is not true.  If you're in a chess position
which is drawn with best play by both players then a losing
move is clearly worse than one which maintains the draw,  but
it's absurd to claim that all moves which maintain the
draw are equally good;  some will give you better winning chances than
others.

This is true for both complex
games like go and simple games like tic-tac-toe. What makes the
difference between go and tic-tac-toe is the difficulty <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>for_humans<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to
find or at least approximate the correct moves. Furthermore, there's no
meaningful non-human concept of approximating correct moves.

I disagree.  I think if you could teach blue furry creatures
from alpha centauri to play chess,  they'd play it a lot like
humans,  including making the same sorts of mistakes.

Even that
must be thought so that a good approximation is such that the human
opponent does not know how to answer it correctly (or by an
approximation of correct ((this is recursive, not circular 
characterization)) ).

The number of branches is not the correct way to measure difficulty,

Obviously not.  Nobody suggested it was.  But the fact that such an
obviously naive approach fails doesn't refute the possibility that
there is such a thing as the objective complexity of a game.
