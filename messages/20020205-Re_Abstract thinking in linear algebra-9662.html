Frankly, when I came to North America, I found the very

The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,
understanding cannot be taught in calculus.  Children are able
to understand mathematical concepts until this ability is 
destroyed by imitating computers.  The teachers COULD NOT
learn the new math which mathematicians could teach children.

Well, there's algebra and there's algebra.  In high school (and at some
"college algebra" classes) algebra means solving polynomials (99.85% of
the time linear and quadratic) and doing some basic analytic geometry
(circles, parabolas, what not).

This is the least important part of algebra.

to solve them).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nobody should start with problems to be done with one
equation.  One does not need complicated methods to solve
arbitrarily large systems of linear equations, in any
case.  Successive elimination belongs at the beginning.

	 In college, "algebra" deals with, well,
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
"algebras"--sets and operations on them (groups, rings, fields, etc).
Linear algebra fits into this in a natural way, and matrices are the
"canonical" examples of linear operators in algebra.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A linear algebra course belongs after or within abstract
algebra.  Those who cannot understand abstract algebra will
only get the computer imitation part of linear algebra,
anyhow.
