Around Christmas, I wrote to them, and got a reply to my second email.
Now, they didn't answer me in a month, although Kerry assured me the
delay was just temporary with the winter issue.

I hope too, but the prospects don't look too good...

Does anyone know what's the situation with the magazine Abstract Games?

I haven't received an issue since last winter.  This seems to be the last
issue they published, according to their website.  I wrote to them a couple of
weeks ago, but have not yet heard back from them.

Hopefully they haven't gone out of business.
