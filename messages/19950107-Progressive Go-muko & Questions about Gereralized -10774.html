A friend of mine and I were talking about a new game invented
called, PROGRESSIVE GO-MOKU. Played on a standard 19x19 Go board,
each player in turn takes one more move than the previous player,
with the restriction that all moves in a single turn must be _mutually
non-adjacent_, and 5 in a row wins. Who has the win? What is the maximum
length forcable row on an infinite board and who can force it -- or is
there no maximum with best play?

This got me looking in my files and I found this from Chris
Sanderson <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:cisande@gamma.std.com">&lt;cisande@gamma.std.com&gt;</a>:

Five in a row (go-moku) is really a variant to tic-tac-toe.
Go-moku is one example of a number of games based on getting
n-in-a-row. Also, the rule can state four directions only, or
all directions are allowed. All tic-tac-toe games are either a
win for the first player, or the second player can force a tie.

Here is rundown of the tic-tac-toe like games and their current
status at to being winnable or not.

1. normal tic-tac-toe. A draw only because the board is so
   small. Obviously three in a row is easy on a large board.

2. 3x3x3 tic tac toe. An easy win for the first player.

3. 4x4x4 tic tac toe. Recently show to be a win for the first
   player. The strategy for doing it is rather involved.

And now on to n in a row on an arbitrary board. (19x19 is large enough)

4. 1,2,3 in a row a win for the first player

5. 4 in a row, 8 directions. A win for the first player.

6. 4 in a row, 4 direstions (NSEW). A draw can be forced by the
   second player. To do this, each square has a well defined
   compliment square. For every stone put by the first player, the
   second puts his ston on the complement square. The details are
   complicated.

7. 5 in a row, 4 direction. Same as above.

8. 5 in a row, 8 directions. This is the commonly played go-moku
   game. I list it this way to show that go-moku is actually one of
   a family of similar games, each of which can be put into the
   winable or drawable class. Five in a row was only recently shown to be a
   win for the first player. This was the hardest of the
   tic-tac-toe like games to solve. However, this does not mean
   that just because its won that the player will find the right
   moves. In fact, of all such games, this one did require the most
   computer time and analysis to solve. Of all these types of
   games, this one is the most challenging. Still, it is just
   tic-tac-toe, and you should really play a good game of chess.

I'm wondering which of this questions have been answered:

  1. Is 6 in a row* a draw on an infinite board? If not, 
     what is the minimum n in a row that is known to be 
     a draw on an infinte board?

  2. What is the smallest square board on which 5 in a row is a known 
     to be a win for the first player?

  3. What is the smallest square board on which 4 in a row is a win for 
     the first player?  [Order 6, right?]

  4. Is six or more in a row forcable on an infinite board if we extend
     the definition of a row to include ANY set of equally spaced colinear
     squares? For example:

     x - - x - - x - - x - - x - - x
     - y - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     - - - y - - - - - - - - - - - -
     - - - - - y - - - - - - - - - -
     - - - - - - - y - - - - - - - -
     - - - - - - - - - y - - - - - -
     - - - - - - - - - - - y - - - -


Moving to three dimensions:

  5. What is the minimum size cube on which 5 in a row is known to be a
     win for the first player?^ 

  6. What is the minimum n in a row that is a draw on an infinite 3d board?

  7. What is known about generalized tic-tac-toe in 4 or more dimensions?


On a Hexagonal grid:

  8. What is them maximum length row that can be forced by the first player
     on an infinite hexagonal grid?#

  9. What is the minimum order hexagonal grid on which 3, 4 or 5 in a
     row can be forced by the first player?


* A row can be in any of 4 orientations to win:
  two orthoganal, two diagaonal.

^ A row can be in any of 13 orientations to win:
  3 orthoganal, 6 plane diagonal, 4 cubic diagonal.
  (A 4d row has 40 orientations and 5d rows have 
  121 ... I think.)

# A row can be in any of 3 orientations to win, one 
  each parallel to each pair of sides of the grid.


Then of course there's DOUBLEMOVE GO-MOKU -- the first player makes one
mark and from then on, each player in turn plays twice, 6 in a
row wins. Who has the win? Is 6 the maximum length forcable on an
infinite board? Doublemove is also played on an order 5
cube -- 5 in a row wins, and on a order 6 cube.


Email responses and I'll summarize here.
