Actually the game played by most computer "mancala" programs is called "Awari".
During the computer olympiad (many board games) this is played each year.
The best program at the moment is called Lithidion.
Mid 1995 the worldchampionships will be played in The Netherlands.
I am the programmer of the program called "MyProgram" which got
2nd place in the 1992 computer olympiad.
(The rules are simple! Very good for learning about programming board games!
 and best of all it's perfect for optimization in assembly!)
