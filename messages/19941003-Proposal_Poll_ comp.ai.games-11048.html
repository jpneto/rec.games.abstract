Straw Poll - Please Reply By Mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:rtfm@cyberspace.com">rtfm@cyberspace.com</a>

	A few months ago, there was some noise about trying to create a
newsgroup for the discussion of artificial intelligence in computer
games.  Some of the interest was from the usual suspects, such as
chess programmers.  The proposals went nowhere, and one of the main
points of obfuscation was where in the heirarchy such a group would
be placed.

	Since much of what's applicable to AI in a given game can also be
applied to other games, a single group could bring a lot of people
together who would otherwise never share information.  It would also
permit game programmers to learn enough about AI to accomplish their
goals, without getting the advanced degrees required to understand
the posts in the comp.ai.* groups.

	Since I am personally interested in the subject, and would like
to determine whether or not there is sufficient interest for such a
group, I ask that you take a minute to respond to this poll.  Responses
will determine whether I take the time to go through the creation
process.  Answers can be simple yes/no, or maybe, or as detailed as you
like.

PART 1:  Is anyone interested?

Question #1:  Would you read a newsgroup about AI &amp; Computer Games?

Question #2:  Would you post in a newsgroup about AI &amp; Computer Games?


PART 2:  Where does it go?

Question #3:  Would you vote for (or against) the creation of comp.ai.games?

Question #4:  Would you vote for (or against) the creation of rec.games.ai?


PART 3:  Anything else?

Question #5:  Does your site carry alt newsgroups?

Question #6:  Any ideas?  Suggestions?  Want to help?
