Here's a shot at my first connection game. Skip the "blabla" to get to
the rules.

(blabla)
I was inspired by analyzing Fractal.  Mark Steere and Cameron Browne
both mentioned to me something about more and less valuable spaces
shrinking the board size since people will go for the more valuable
spaces first anyway.  I picked an octagon tessellation to work with
since it has obvious differences between the squares and the
octagons.  I tried raising the value of the squares by giving them the
ability to sever the connection of the octagons.  This made the
squares super powerful so I limited the bridges to not being
connectable. Finally I added the rule that when you create a
possibility to create a bridge you must take it at that moment.  This
took an annoying backtracking element out of it and now I think it's a
nice game.  I'm curious how the strategy evolves or if does and if
will end up interesting to play in the long run.  No draws are
possible.  Did I make the squares and octagons equally advantageous to
take? I hope so!
(/blabla)

Rules:
- Octess is played on an octagonal tessellation. The goal for blue is
to connect the blue side of the board with the other blue side of the
board. The goal for green is to do the same with the green sides.
- Players take turns filling in either a blank square or an octagon.
- Squares have a special feature. When two diagonally adjacent squares
are filled in with the same color then a bridge between them must be
made. This will split the sandwiched octagon's connection.
- A bridge cannot connect to another bridge.
- A bridge cannot build over another bridge.
- If a placement of a square provides an opportunity for more than one
bridge to be built then the player must choose exactly one to build.
- When a bridge is made over a blank octagon then that blank octagon
may still be claimed by either player.
- Once one player has made their connection the other player receives
one last turn since there is an opportunity to sever the connection

- let me know if you want to try it and I'll send you a google docs
invite by mail
- or if you just want a copy of the document to play someone else then
i can duplicate it and hand over the google.docs permissions to you.
