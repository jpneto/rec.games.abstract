You could, now that I think a little, end the game when the first
player reaches a score that is exactly a number that fits into a
certain class, such as, the game ends as soon as a player gets a score
that is a factorial. The problem with this approach is that neither
player may obtain the magic type of number until there are no more
moves possible anyway. The trick would be finding the correct class of
number. In any case, we can end the game with a "whichever comes first
-- no more moves possible, OR a score that is a ____"-rule.

Factorials are pretty sparse.  Frankly, you might do fine with
something as simple as winning if your score is a multiple of, oh, 20.
Note that scores are always even (since the two numbers in a square
are either both odd or both even), and each move adds at least 4 to
one's score (by the no-U-turn rule), so multiple of 10 might be too
common, but 20 might be tricky enough to provide some tactics.

But then, I figured part of the charm was to try to maneuver the path
so as to score some big payoffs without giving an equally big payoff
to the opponents (since in many cases the path could end up replaying
a sequence of squares, adding the same amount each turn).  So maybe
in addition to ending the game early, the player whose score achieved
the special game-ending property should get some of bonus, and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>then<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
high score wins?  (Sort of the the Qwidditch scoring rule, but not so
lop-sided.)

Oh, and as before, I think the rules could be phrased much more
concisely.  This sentence in particular just made my head warp until
I read the simpler version that followed it:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A player may also not write a number in the square previously written
in by the player who moved before the last player to move.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

How about:  Each square starts empty and can contain up to two numbers.
Players take turns writing consecutive integers into the squares, where
each placement must be orthogonally adjacent to the previous square, and
the second number written into a square cannot be exactly 2 greater than
the first.  When a player writes the second number in a square, that player
scores the difference between the two numbers there.  [Add game-ending
condition.]

One further idea (though this makes the no-U-turn rule harder to state
again): How about if, after a player writes the number K in the grid,
the next player may write <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> K+1 or K+2.  That would let some of
the differences be odd, which might open up more tactics for achieving
the game-ending condition.
