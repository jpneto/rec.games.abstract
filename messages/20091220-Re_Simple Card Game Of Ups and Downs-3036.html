I wouldn't want to open the flood gates on luck based games.  Quite the
opposite.  But, that being said, an abstract game is so awash with luck
already that a tumbling pair of dice only adds a little more.  Every (turn
based) abstract game begins with a coin toss. And no, the pie rule doesn't
cancel that out.  Even if perfect play were known the pie rule might not
cancel out the luck of the coin toss.  The possibility of invoking the pie
rule might only transfer, though greatly diminish, the advantage from Player
1 to Player 2.  Assuming that the game's perfect play is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> known by the
players, since otherwise it wouldn't be a game for the players, the players
would only be guessing about which moves to call pie rule on, said guesswork
being subject to the laws of chance (i.e. luck).  Add that luck to the luck
of the coin toss.  It's cumulative.  Moving on to the gameplay...  When
pitting your guesswork against the guesswork of your opponent there's only
one deciding factor - luck.  You don't even have to be equally matched.  You
might get lucky and beat a more skilled player.  A couple of clever moves
are made - obvious moves that suddenly and surprisingly became available to
you at precisely the right moment, definitely not planned in advance.

Well-stated, my man!

I would only point out that - at least to me - the guesswork that's
going on in your head is the best place for any of that sort of
thing.  That is where we want it.  Also - not exactly every game
begins with a coin toss, but perhaps every match, where a match could
be a series of alternating games of length 1 to N.  And, if I recall
correctly, some matches always begin with the Challenger having the
first move in the first game against the Defending Champion, and in
some cases if the number of games is even and alternating who is
first, the Defender holds the title if they split the games right down
the middle.  True, other matches of other games are set up differently
and would fall into your "cumulative" category.  Some have randomly
generated boards, for example...
