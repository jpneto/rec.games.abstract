My idea for salvaging the game would be to have each piece be a third of a hexagon, cutting from the center to each of three vertices.  Then there'd be six ways to place a piece in a cell.  I don't know if this would work..  It's just a thought.

This is not trivalent. To make it trivalent, you'd have to cut from the center to the middle of the edges, but that would be topologically equivalent to the Hex grid.

I don't believe that would be equivalent to Hex.  Here you can divide a hexagonal cell into three sub-cells two different ways, so the sub-cells aren't predetermined.

Right, but if you do that, the board is again non-trivalent.

Type 3 is equivalent to Hex. If the apothems of any single hexagon are rotated 60º, 4 sub-cells will meet at each of the intersections between the apothems and the edges of that hexagon.

Heh, I was talking about the picture labelled as "type 3" as if the hexagons in it were cut in three parts "from the center to each of three vertices", as Mark suggested, but actually that tessellation already features asymmetric pieces. That's more evident in the red picture, though.

So "type 3" already works as a trivalent, variable orientation cell division connection game... How interesting.
