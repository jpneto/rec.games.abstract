<br>Wetware shortcoming? Hmm!

<br>
<br>I detest many removing cybernetics from game theory and focusing on
<br>the thought processes of the player. I don't want to start arguing on
<br>the meaning of perfect information;' I studied enough of cybernetics
<br>to occupy a room or two. My, lad, the outcome of the game, for that
<br>matter any game, is not a matter of wetware' but of information. Now
<br>that may be a surprise to many that think they have something in
<br>themselves that is inherently special, some special quality, some
<br>special thought process, some special, well you get my point. And that
<br>special something' is the reason why
<br>: they won a game, they got the promotion, they are a Doctor, they
<br>All rubbish!

<br>&nbsp;ah... i see, you are still not on board in this newsgroup.
<br>&nbsp;you may want to try rec.games.philosophy???&nbsp; or rec.games.computer?
<br>&nbsp;maybe alt.games.shared-reality???&nbsp; i dont know if these discussions
<br>&nbsp;are a better place, alas - this is not the place.

<br>&nbsp;;-)

<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>The most important thing is not knowing what special immeasurable
<br>quality is in a person but knowing all the information that has every
<br>been sent to that person and all the information that that person is
<br>sending. Personally I seen enough, and I mean enough, of the world to
<br>know that the only difference among people is not a matter of
<br>wetware' but a matter of information, and from that precious little 
information you get your winners and losers.'
<br>
<br>
<br>I going off at all sorts of tangents, so see if you can follow. 
</blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;yes...maybe entertaining, but quite off-topic.&nbsp; ;-)
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I guess what I'm trying to say is that the winner and loser of games,
<br>including the games that have perfect information' are not a matter
<br>of something inner but of something outer, COMMUNICATION. There are no
<br>games like you describe, i.e. that's outcome is depend on the
<br>wetware.' Get real dude! Pick up a copy of, "a dummies guide to
<br>cybernetics, and read it; you'll thank me for it : )
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;i may just do that, friend.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I read the article you recommended, ok not all but I scanned it. Chess
<br>is not a game of wetware it is a game of information. Information of
<br>knowing future or possible future outcomes; Information of knowing all
<br>that has been input into an individual and knowing all of an
<br>individuals outputs. My lad, I do understand your examples of
<br>imperfect information, a card not turned over, someone not giving a
<br>fuck about you to tell you a little information that could save your
<br>ass, save your future, save your love for someone more accepting, and
<br>some towering walls not peeped over yet, etc, and why they are
<br>detestable, but, and I say but, my lad, the few games that are around
<br>that reveal the very nature of the life we life in, must not be thrown
<br>away and hidden, must not be used to promote wetware,' and must not
<br>be separated from cybernetics.
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; but again, quite off topic....how do you go from a card not
<br>&nbsp;turned over to a human being's love life in one fell swoop?&nbsp; see,
<br>&nbsp;this group is too narrow-minded for your sorts of speculations!
<br>&nbsp;i hope you understand we mean no harm here, just would like to stick
<br>&nbsp;to the subject.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>There are no games worth playing
<br>without a little imperfect information.
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;this is where we disagree...and that is what this group is about.
<br>&nbsp;perfect game information is not at all like your idea of perfect
<br>&nbsp;life information.&nbsp; you are too grounded in things metaphysical,
<br>&nbsp;my friend.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;And the games, life games
<br><blockquote type=cite>included, that are becoming absolute (perfect information) are played
<br>by people with corrupted information to only humilate, control, and
<br>further their exhausting and feasting ways. I detest that more than
<br>even cheaters. At least with a cheater, you can cheat back : )
<br>With certain players and their corrupted information, you can only
<br>hope...
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;well, like Who Is the Current POTUS?
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Xong, your game is very interesting, Nate.
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;thank you.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>You thought about combining
<br>my game and your game together.
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;i wasnt thinking along that line at all, i think you are
<br>&nbsp;reading into my words.&nbsp; ;-)
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>Nate, don't worry about the tone of this post; it has nothing to do
<br>with you; it's just the way I write : )
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp;not worrying at all - infact, entertained in an amusing way.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>&nbsp;I hope I didn't go to far off tangent.

<br>&nbsp;take care.
