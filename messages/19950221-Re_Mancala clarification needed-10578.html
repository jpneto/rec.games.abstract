   Hi, the rules I use are few and simple, and I -think- they are the most
commonly used set...

   On your turn, your turn ends when you sow your last piece, unless your
last piece ends in your goal, in which case you get another turn.
   If your last piece ends in an empty space across from a space on the
other side of the board that has pieces in it, this is a capture.  You
take your stone and all of the stones in the adjacent space and put them
in your store and your turn ends.

   So the answer to your question is that your turn ends.  Hope this
helps.  And yes, there are a bazillion variations, some of which I could
post if you're interested...
