Well I don't usually followup to these, but this one conatains so much drivel
I can't let it go by.  (Mea culpa.)

|&gt; 
|&gt; Depends on what you mean by "about even".
|&gt; 
|&gt; Hex.  Since draws are impossible, every position is an advantage for
|&gt; one side or the other.  If you play hex on a small enough board, then
|&gt; this becomes obvious---it's impossible to equalize 4x4 hex to be an
|&gt; "about even" game for experienced players.

Sure sure sure sure sure; any game where draws are impossible can't possibly be
subject to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>perfect<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> equalization of any sort (other than playing pairs of 
games).  I took this to be obvious, and the intended point of "about" in my
"about even".  And very tiny boards where full analysis is possible, such as
mentioned above, could indeed be said to have moves "too coarse-grained" to
allow possible (practical) equalization.  Again, almost by definition.

However: it would still be intersting to see if there were any games whose
moves were "naturally" coarse-grained; in the sense that though there may be
positions where it was difficult to say who was ahead, there were no such
3-move positions, i.e. all of these were trivially seen to be a big advantage
to one or the other.    I am inclined to think there are no such games around.
I would be happy to see a counterexample though!!

|&gt; While I tend to agree with you about stalemate, YOUR wild-eyed,
|&gt; spittle-flying rant against stalemate

Ho ho!  Very good; I asked for that one!  ;-)

|&gt; forces me to play devil's advocate :-).

Well, easy enough to shoot down a devil's advocaat!   :)
 
|&gt; And there is a natural explanation for the stalemate rule:  Clocks are
|&gt; a relatively recent addition to the game.  Without a clock, a player in
|&gt; stalemate simply doesn't (can't) move, and never loses.  One of the
|&gt; historical reasons for adding clocks to chess is that players who were
|&gt; losing sometimes started "thinking" for outragous lengths of time...

Good grief!  This is the worst I've ever heard!  I don't ever think I've heard
the most paranoid chess expert come up with this doozy!  Obviously, without
clocks (or equivalent), NO game of chess can EVER be won by ANYONE!  What a
klutzy argument!  Clearly it has no bearing on particular issues like stalemate!

|&gt; For chess, I think a good (i.e., sensible) argument for stalemate is
|&gt; that it makes end-game theory more interesting---which has implications
|&gt; throughout the entire game.

This is much better; and I've heard it argued before.  It is true to an extent,
but it works both ways. Once stalemate is a loss, then KP v K is a win, and
then a lot more endgame theory comes <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>into<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play, that was irrelevant before;
such as how to get down to KP-K positions, never bothered with before because
they were trivial stalemate draws.  So I think the amount-of-endgame-interest
argument is a swings-&amp;-roundabouts one; and would require more careful and
lengthy consideration than we're prepared to give it here.

|&gt; To note the opposite bias about the game:  End-game theory tends to
|&gt; only be a major issue for strong chess players.  Amateurs rarely
|&gt; reach the end-game, so the stalemate rule seems pointless.

I totally disagree. I'm a rather weak amateur, and love the end-game more than
anything, (as I suspect do most "games-players" rather than "chess-players"); I
always try to direct games toward a won endgame, if poss. (Often with success.)
 
|&gt; Fundamentally, chess is not a game for those who want "elegant" rules.
|&gt;   For elegance, I recomment Go with chinese rules.

I agree with you heartily on both counts.

However, even though chess does not have elegant rules, they should still be
kept consistently within the "spirit of the game", as much as poss, IMHO.
And that spirit is "kill the king" + "you must move on your turn"; so stalemate
is definitely a no-no on this count.


Now you can crawl back to virtual Hades, and leave your client there!  :)
Cheers,  Bill.
