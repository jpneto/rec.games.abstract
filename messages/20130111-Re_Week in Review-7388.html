Corey, you're totally coming unhinged.  I told you it was a joke.  Just for the record, I'm totally against the exploitation of children in any way.  In Toddlers and Tiaras the moms totally sexualize their kids.  It's disgusting.  Did you watch season 4?  It was outrageous.  I totally don't watch that anymore hardly.

Your jokes are not making you look any better. There's at least a grain of truth in every joke.

Dude you're a ranting lunatic.  What are you - Hazen?  You're a weasel.  It blew up in your face, just like I said, and now you're coming unglued.  You got exactly what you deserved, weasel.  Btw, you never responded to my "underground dungeon" charge.  Hoping nobody noticed?  Or is this something I supposedly fabricated like your dog carcass thrill?

Even if it doesn't have any effect on the nature of discourse (if you could call it that) between you and others on RGA it still hasn't blown up in my face. I haven't experienced any sort of loss, even in the most nebulous sense. In fact I did exactly what I intended to. As for the underground dungeon, I figured I had probably mentioned something like a bunker at some point as I have an unfortunate susceptibility to doomsday paranoia. I'd love to hear what your take on it is. Doubtless another complete lie, yes kind of like the dog carcass.

Maybe you were totally drunk, as usual.  All I remember is the revolting image of you standing over an animal corpse getting your jollies, "you sick fuck".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


So basically you can't even be bothered to flesh out your bullshit story. Okay, moving on then.

Why, because I shit on you as a designer?  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes at one point when I actually believed this. Before Slither was renamed and its subsequent popularity began to come into view, before I had new games to follow it up with, before you released terrible shit like Monkey Queen and Rive, before Cephalopod fell down like a house of cards, before I improved on Tanbo, and most of all before I got over Hex Oust. In conjunction these factors have nullified any intimidation I felt earlier. Well apart from the fact that you have enough money to put a hit on me and what with your inclining insanity probably would, but that's a whole different animal. 

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And because I serve as a painful reminder of your fizzled plans to show me up?  I didn't get where I am whiling away the hours on a Playstation 3.  Get off your lazy ass and do something with your life.  Stop blaming the 1% for your self inflicted woes and wallowing in self pity, you crybaby.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You got where you are leeching off of your parents. You live life on easy mode, that is apparent. Okay so you did some software development. So did Greg K. Van Patten and he sure as hell aint rich. You've obviously consumed more wealth than you've created. I don't blame the 1% for any of my "woes". I just blame your parents for enabling you to nurture the mentality of a 5 year-old well into your golden years.

Good analogy, because you're the Rhesus monkey here, rattling your own cage.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It wouldn't be a very good analogy if it were applied to myself because I was talking about you and therefore it would fail to be analogous. Okay that was fun. Next item on the list...

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
More threats?  Threats that will result in your own major meltdown?  Like now?  Let's see what you got, retarded monkey boy.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't think you know what a meltdown looks like Mark. I haven't even touched the capslock button. I'm fucking cruising here. I keep exposing you as a reprehensible human being and you just keep coming back with insults like retard. Nobody is bothering to keep score of course but you can't debate worth a shit.
