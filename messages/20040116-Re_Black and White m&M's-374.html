I think I understand the gist of your density argument, but I don't see a
specific way to apply it to the orthogonally-attached game. Would you mind
demonstrating? (Let's not worry about the restriction on Black's 2nd move for
now.)

I wasn't thinking of it as anything specific.  My thought was, if only 1 out
of 4 is the minimum needed to block, then a player having twice that should
be able to block without much difficulty.  There's no guarantee that I'm
right, of course.  I think the orthogonally-attached rule probably makes it
harder to block, but by the same token it might make it harder to achieve,
too.

That's a good point.  The only way to know for sure is to study it
carefully.  Hopefully the e-mail game we're having will yield some
insights.
