Combinatorics123 is a mild mannered, polite individual with a barely detectable accent, and nearly perfect diction.

"Hello,

Is it the right place to post a (new?) abstract game?

Thank you.

Ps : If it is then I will post my game in the next post."

"The game could be played with pencil and pre-printed paper.

Print a board 8x8 with circles instead of tokens.
Print 16 sticks in front of each player with a circle at right

Every time a player choose a a kind of stick and tokens he puts a cross into the corresponding circles.
That is it!

For each game you use one sheet.
You could even use only one sheet if instead of cross you just place a stone.

What is important is : how the game mechanics hold? Does it need some improvements to make the game more attractive (yes or no)?

Enjoy the game and let me know.

Thank you."

Here in r.g.a., Hazen Abouricha also claims to have invented Exasott.  Bizarrely, Hazen is not the polite individual in the xkcd forum.  Hazen is a ranting lunatic with poor grammar whose accent is so thick he's barely comprehensible.

"Hey Christian do you know how many game allow the use of opponent pieces??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
How many????????????????????????
Since when in history???????????
How can you say that in hex there is NO BAD MOVE??????????
Read the rules carefully!!!
INSTEAD OF POINTING THE SIMILARITIES AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SIMILARITIES WITH THOUSAND OF GAMES POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE GAME.

CHRISTIAN YOU ARE A CRAPPY DESIGNER A COPY-PASTER.
WHICH ONE OF YOUR GAME IS ORIGINAL? NOT ONE!!!
MY GAMES ARE NOT COPY-PASTED GAMES.
I CHALLENGE MARKRAPPY TO SHOW IN DETAILS THE PLAGIARISM OF EXASOTT.
MY GAME EXASOTT WAS IMPLEMENTED BY SOMEONE I DO NOT KNOW. GOOGLE IT!!!
PEOPLE ARE BEGGING PROGRAMMERS TO IMPLEMENT THEIR GAME."

"GOOD BYE!!!
I CUT INTERNET!!!
STARTING FROM TOMORROW NO INTERNET"

"My passion is gambling.
GOOD BYE!!!"

"Now I have to say Good Bye Mark."

"Now fuck you all!!!"

"Now good bye!
You will never see me."

Hmmmm.  Hazen's game of Exasott was purportedly implemented by someone he doesn't know.  Odd because Combinatorics123 does know the programmer of Exasott - Alex Hammel.  He met Alex in the xkcd forum while "BEGGING PROGRAMMERS TO IMPLEMENT [his] GAME".

There's no executable program that I could find for Exasott (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github..com/ahammel/Exasott">https://github..com/ahammel/Exasott</a>).  Just a bunch of raw code.  Exasott can't be found on any game servers.  So you can only test Exasott by yourself apparently if you have a Python interpreter.  

A crappy program for a crappy game by a crappy inventor.
