Anyways, thus pie rule does not work for every game, each game must be
considered by itself, with special attention given to part 5 (chess
has everything wrong in 1-4, hex has everything right going for it in
1-5).  Far too often people are willing to just toss pie rule in their
game in the hopes that it will fix everything about their game without
any problems, and in doing so, they never consider the alternatives.
I beleive this is the biggest mistake of all in the pie rule (each
time the pie rule is misused, it does a fraction of the damage that
not considering another more valid option does).
Anyways, lets consider monkey queen
1.  Without the pie rule, white has a huge advantage (75%+), with the
pie rule, white has an ever so slightly smaller advantage (my estimate
is 72%, though it may be as low as 70% [the main difference is that it
takes an extra couple of moves to get a winning attack, thus a couple
more chances for you to blunder])
2.  Draws are not possible, attack and defense are not equivalent
3.  Without pie rule, many moves are possible, generally up to the
center or past it, each with different implied continuations, with pie
rule, moving one forward is the only good option, the only good follow
ups are corner fortress continuations.
4.  There is such a thing as a bad move, so you must make every move
relevant
5.  the game offers a lot of adjustables for balance.  For one, the
stacks could be uneven, as a larger black stack increases black's
winning chances.  Another is that the initial stacks could be smaller
initially (black has the win if both players run out, plus the smaller
both's initial stacks, the more relevant black's increases)
I think without any balancing attempt, i would still rather take the
small hit to balance in match play than lose the options of playing
actively (even if i usually fortress anyways)

My proposal:  player one decides how large the initial white and black
stack will be (12-13 is my best guess at fair, 15-17 for if you want
seperation of 2), then player 2 chooses whether to play white or
black.
I think this is much more fair, and much more natural to the game.

Anyways, now for so more fun comments:
Tennis style match play break serve,  the size of the problem depends
on teh length of the game.  If player 1 has a large advantage but the
game lasts only 20 seconds, you can play enough alternated repetitions
to get a conclusive result.  If player 1 has a small advantage but
games last 10 hours, you might have a far less conclusive result even
though the balance was closer
People far underestimate how robust Chess really is.  The things sited
are:
Openings are known too deeply
Games are too drawish now.
Openings are known 20 moves deep, and are not to the point where the
game is decided.   Mid game still decides most games.  Look at Topalov
vs Anand (most recent world championship).  Topalov had the advantage
after the opening in all but 1 game (thanks to the help of a super
computer) but still managed to lose the match due to poor middlegame
play (usually his strong point, probably fell out of practice
obsessing over new opening variations).
Draw rate in world championship play is now at 53% in the past 3
matchces, draw rate in the 3 world championships leading up to 1911
was 49%.  We have not had a significant increase in drawishness in
match play in chess.  What we have had is an incrase in draws by
agreement in tournaments, where players get to a level where they will
keep getting invites, then they offer to draw without really playing
with everyone as to not risk their rating.  They can do this because
people look at elo now to judge anyone, where as it was funded by
bored aristocrats before who wouldn't finance anyone who wasn't
entertaining to watch [as we should do with these draw by agreement
players, no matter how highly rated they are (i'm looking at you,
kramnick.)].  The other thing people site is the disaster between
kasparov and karpov when they didn't have a maximum match length,
where no player would every try for a win because it was easier to
just wait for the opponent to blunder (set match lengths fixes that
problem).

Fischer was soooooooo wishy washy it isn't even funny.  Fischer lost
to the king's gambit, so he did a lot of opening preperation,
declaired the king's gambit dead, proceeded to use the king's gambit,
then declaired that chess is dead due to opening preperation, then
only showed his face to play chess, never "Fischer Random Chess" [with
or without his stupid stupid stupid castling rule]

Checkers is dead to learn how to play well, as there is now just a set
script to follow after you learn strategic details.  However, the
concept of checkers is not dead.  10x10 english checkers isn't solved,
and in fact, checkers would be very hard to solve in general, as you
could always move one board size up (and the strategic themes still
makse sense as you increase teh board size).  In fact, most games are
like this, you could always just play on a larger board .  Chesses are
one of the only games where this is not really possible beyond a point
(you can make logical adaptations like grand chess, but where would
you go from there?)

The subtree theory only works if a move can have no negative impact.
If a move has no negative impact, then the worst white could be by
ignoring his first move is the same position black would have been in
in the first place, thus opening jsut as many options.  If a move can
have a negative impact (chess, go if viewed as a specific move rather
than an available move (passing is an available move which has no
negative impact), then the following moves must make your move
meaningful, thus setting the coarse for the rest of play, thus
offering a smaller subtree than the original tree driven back one tier

and that's all i have to say at the moment
