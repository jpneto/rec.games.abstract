You know what's changed here in the last year while you were out on
butt-thumb sabbatical, Bill?  In a word, Oust.  Just for example, Corey
Clark hates me and he's like the number three Oust player in the world. 
That has to say something.

Oust rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Oust_rules.pdf</a>

Oust simply has edge-of-your-seat gameplay from the first move to the last
move.  There's no let-up.  Oust is the "American Go".  Its potential for
popularity is unimaginably vast.

I never used to care about popularity and I still don't, at least not that
much.  I'm only human.  But Oust seems to have boosted my stature a little,
all by itself, rendering you, Bill, even more puny in comparison - no easy
feat!

Taylor, I have Oust, and you have...

What??  Slime Trail?? rofl

Taylor, Freeling has Havannah, and you have...

What??  Free Willy?? rofl

It's just incredible you even have the stamina to continue harrumphing after
all the testimony we've heard.
