Has this kind of game been studied mathematically? I'm
thinking connection games, chess games, and others would
be illuminated by this study.

The games Teeko, Dao and my own Neutreeko all have a few
pieces of each colour that move around on a small board,
and the object is to arrange them in a certain way. I have
written java-programs that give a full analysis of all of
them (with a simplification for Teeko), in case you are
interested: Visit my web page <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.neutreeko.com">http://www.neutreeko.com</a> and
download GameAnalysis.zip.

Definitely not what I'm looking for.  I seek abstractions from the
details of games to their essential strategies, whereas GameAnalysis
appears to search reams and reams of details for the answer.
The difference is analagous to the difference between enumerating
logical truth tables and simplifying logical predicates algebraically.
