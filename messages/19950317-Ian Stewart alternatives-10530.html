  Is this the proper place to discuss Ian Stewart?  Well, Mathematical 
Games by Martin Gardner pretty much WAS abstract games for a long time.  
That's why Winning Ways, THE abstract games book, is dedicated to MG.
  Ian Stewart isn't awful.  I must admit, though, I have trouble reading 
what he's gone through.  And it isn't a matter of understanding.  Oh, well.
 
  However, there are a few good alternatives:
  1. Clifford Pickover.  He's prolific, and has a wonderful sense of what 
is visually interesting.  I've got 5 of his books.  I know he's written 
at least 6 others that haven't been printed yet (several of these 
co-authored with Piers Anthony).
  2. Martin Gardner.  He still puts out books, and does a column in the 
Skeptical Inquirer.
  3. Michael Keller.  He puts out World Game Review almost annually, and 
does a good job of it.  Every page is fascinating.
  4. Phil Cohen.  He's been writing a bimonthly column for Nost-algia (a 
chess club) since the sixties.  For non-chess games and chess varients, 
he's ... well, I'm not sure what to call him.  His writing has a gonzo 
attitude that I admire.
  5. MG sources.  Most of the books and journals mentioned by Martin 
Gardner canbe ordered through your library.

  GAMES magazine <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>should<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be a good alternative, but isn't.  For a column 
to thrive, you have to toss out interesting, unsolved questions 
regularly.  With a wide audience, someone will find the answer.  I think 
that's the main reason I liked Martin .... he drew his columns from the 
combined intelligence of his entire readership.  And with that, he 
trusted his readers.
  Perhaps that is why I like Michael, Phil, and Cliff.  They work 
extensively with their readership.  Does Ian?
