You guys both seem to be responding to something that wasn't written,
at least not by me.  Allow me to repeat what I did say:

"The design objective was to construct the largest possible game tree
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>using Checkers equipment<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (emphasis newly added)."

Checkers has 64 squares, and 24 pieces.  Go, in comparison, has 361
points and 361 pieces.  Do you really think I was hoping to create a
game tree as big as Go's with Checker's equipment?  Sure, the
stackability of checkers gives you a lot of extra mileage, but not
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much extra mileage!

An outstanding example of the rampant, ergonomic abomination in this

One of the things that limit Draughts and Basic is that only the black

Of course!  Why didn't I think of that??  Oh, that's right...  my
pesky design imperative prohibiting ergonomic abomination.  Checkers
(the pieces) have evolved over hundreds of years to be about the same
size as the board squares, which is perfect given that only the dark
squares are intended to be used.  If you now use all of the squares
instead of only the dark squares, it becomes impossible to pick up or
slide a stack without disturbing the surrounding stacks with your fat
fingers.  Lovely.

Any other suggestions?  How about a game requiring 26 checkers so that
the 24 in the box won't be enough?
