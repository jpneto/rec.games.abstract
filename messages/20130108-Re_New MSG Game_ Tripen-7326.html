It doesn't matter what you think or care about. And I do agree with Hazen here on one thing, Cephalopod is an atrocious game. Luis and I analyzed the shit out of it. I only asked to show Luis something after our Cephalopod game to have a serious discussion about Cephalopod and pseudodraws (although paradraws is more accurate) with him. We both agreed that its a game of pure parity where actual score difference doesn't matter. It is functionally impartial since it has zugzwang and there are no color dependent mechanics and therefore backloaded with most of the game having no bearing on the outcome. It is also the epitome of a game suffering from paradraws. That is the only thing preventing a draw is an extra space on the board, which is awarded arbitrarily. Cephalopod really is just a glorified Nim.
