You could make it 1/3 stone to prevent ties.  E.g., if there are two white stones and one black stone in a cell, white owns the cell.

I saw the fight outside the cell (similar to capture mechanics used in go or inventing a new mechanics to make the celle belongs to one of the player) not inside. Otherwise there is another alternative requiring more thinking : to cut the cell symmetricaly with blue zones and red zones. In such case you will be obliged to limit the number of pieces used. So there will not be sufficient supply of pieces. But this will make the game harder to manage for the players. They have to think which kind of token I have to use each time keeping in mind that they will run out of some.
Anyway I do not have time to treat all the details because I have found many ways to make a hex game more longer.
I want games (I`m talking about big games) taking at least one hour or more..
For little games like my "blocking" or "tapaoumec" and other the game itself is just a basic mechanics some sort of training tool. 
I give you the example of tictactoe. We could build BIG game using Tictactoe. 3 aligned tokens is the basic and we could patterns combining 3 aligned as blocks etc....
