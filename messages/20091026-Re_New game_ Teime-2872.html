We play a similar version, but where the Y-forming player has to make
a genuine three-alternate-sides connection, a "symmetric" Y.
(OC it may connect other sides as well, irrelevantly.)

We find this asymmetry is not actually a bug, but a FEATURE,
in "chicken" games (like Unlur) where both players play the weaker
side's stones, until someone (is "chicken" and) elects to take
the weaker side (which he deems has now become strong enough
to win with all those early moves), and (necessarily) passes,
and then regular game alternation begins.

There are many game types where one side is "naturally"
stronger than the other, such as Hexagonal Y with only one
player reqyuired to make a Y, and the other to stop him,
(equivalently: make his own Y or an opposites-crossing).

Others are small-board moku games, where the board is
too small and the moku-size (typically 5) is too large for
the moku-former to win ordinarily.  Another would be
a square connection game where the same person
has to connect all four sides; and so on.

The typical case is:- one player has to perform some
quite hard task, and the other only has to prevent him.
No-one knows who is which, until the "chicken" declaration
has been made.   That person then takes the difficult task.

But for those for whom anything but isomorphic or identical connection

Of course the true afficionado will love both types!

I love isomorphic/identical goals where they are possible, but I also

How can one say better than that!!    :-)
