The following is a statement from Raymond Keene, one of  the
organizers for the Silicon Graphics World Checkers Champion-
ship.  He wants to express his  viewpoint  on  the  comments
appearing  in  this  forum, but he does not have an internet
account.

Raymond Keene's statement:

     When Dr. Marion Tinsley informed us that he was  unable
to  continue  the  world  title contest in Boston, we saw no
alternative but to abort the championship.  However, at  Dr.
Tinsley's  personal  urging,  expressed  to us face to face,
Grandmaster Don Lafferty (Tinsley's long time  friend,  col-
league  and student) was brought in to continue the contest.
This was Marion Tinsley's idea and under those circumstances
Dr.  Tinsley was prepared to personally endorse the Chinook-
Lafferty match as the world championship.  It is undoubtedly
a  clash  between  the  two  strongest active players at the
moment, while Marion is indisposed.  Grandmaster Lafferty is
the  reigning  US  Open  champion,  while Chinook had fought
Tinsley to a standstill in the first six games here.

     In my opinion both sides, as well as  Grandmaster  Laf-
ferty,  have acted with the highest degree of sportsmanship,
both to each other and with regard and concern for the spon-
sors,  organizers, spectators and media.  Once the winner of
the Chinook-Lafferty match is known, I would be delighted to
try to organize a new championship against Dr. Tinsley when,
as we all pray and hope, he  successfully  returns  to  full
health.  Meanwhile, Chinook retains the world title and will
continue to do so if the championship in Boston  ends  as  a
draw.
