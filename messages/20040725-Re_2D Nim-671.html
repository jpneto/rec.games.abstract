All correct except the P-pentomino is worth 5, not 1.

You are right Bill! (B.t.w. i like your pentomino nomenclature :).


Now that all polyominos up to the pentominos have been assigned a
Grundy value, the next step is the hexominos. However, there are 35
hexominos, and at the next level we have 108 heptominos. Not only do
the number of configurations grow exponentially, also the number of
possible moves increases rapidly with the size of the polynominos.

Therefore, rather than calculating the Grundy values for the more
complicated polynominos, one might focus on the polynominos that have
a Grundy value of 0 (i.e. the 'cold' polynominos). Only even
polynominos can have zero Grundy value. However, the domino is not
'cold' and amongst the tetrominos we have only seen one 'cold'
configuration, the O-tetromino:

XX
XX

Yet, upon investigating the hexominos I found 8 'cold' configurations:

X   X    X    X   XX   XXX  XXX  XXX  
XX  XX  XXX   XX  XXX  XX   XX    X   
XX  XX  X    XX    X   X     X   XX   
X    X  X    X    

Assuming this very rapid growth of the number of 'cold' configurations
to continue, numerous octominos can be expected to have zero Grundy
value.

All of this is of course very relevant for the end-game. 

Based on the observation that only even polynominos can be 'cold', and
that starting from the O-tetromino the number of 'cold' polynominos
increases rapidly with size, one might modify the rules a bit:

--- PolyoNimo --- 

Starting from a configuration of 2x2 squares with coinciding edges
(the 'O-tetromino') both players in turn add exactly two squares to
the configuration thereby creating a growing polyomino. There is no
restrictions on where to add the new squares apart from the fact that
the edges of the newly added squares should be coinciding with edges
of squares already present.

At any stage, one of the players - instead of further building - can
decide to remove squares from the polynomino. From that moment on both
players have to remove squares. However: there is a restriction on
which removals are allowed: only straight polyominos (a Nx1 rectangle
of squares, N = 1, 2, 3, ..) can be removed.

The player who makes the last move wins.
