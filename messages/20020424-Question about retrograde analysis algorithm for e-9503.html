(Thanks Bob for the answer concerning chess draw-by-repetition
algorithms!)



Can someone help me with a question concerning the retrograde analysis
algorithm?

As I understand it, the retrograde analysis algorithm works something
like:

(1) Initialize each endgame positions with number of possible moves
from this position (children)
(2) Check each position in the database to see if the position score
is the best possible and then notify the parents.  Best possible moves
either have the maximum possible score or are ones where all the
children have been fully evaluated (in an alpha-beta sense).
(3) Iterate #2 a certain number of times depending on the maximum
range of scores which are possible for positions in the database
(4) All remaining unsettled positions get a score of 0

Now I understand step #4 is based on the assumption that all repeating
positions have a certain score, which would be true in chess (where
repeats = draw so score = 0).  But what about a game whose score would
depend on the exact position of the first (or for that matter N'th)
repeat?  Imagine a game where the rules say the game ends whenever a
position is repeated twice (as in chess), but with the additional
caveat that the score might vary depending on the actual position when
this 2nd repeat occurs (in chess, the score of the 2nd repeat is
0=draw)?

How could the retrograde analysis algorithm be changed to take this
variable score on a repeat into account?

THANKS IN ADVANCE!
