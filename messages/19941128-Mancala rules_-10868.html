Is anyone out there familiar with an African game called Mancala (I'm told it's 
also known by many other names, but this is the one I remember).  The board 
consists of 14 "pits" laid out as follows:

           O O O O O O
         O             O
           O O O O O O

The starting position puts pebbles in some (or maybe all; this is why I'm 
looking for the rules) of the pits.  A move consists of picking up all the 
pebbles from one pit and redistributing them by putting one in each of the next 
several pits in the clockwise direction until all the pebbles are so 
distributed.  I'm not sure of how many pebbles start in each pit, which pits 
each player is allowed to play from, or how the game ends.  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated; please post to the group or reply by mail.  Thanks in 
advance!
