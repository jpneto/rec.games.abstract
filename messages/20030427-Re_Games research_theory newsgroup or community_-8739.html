<br>I think it must be YOU who is missing the point. The discussion you are
<br>seeking, according to you, would NOT be of interest to designers of games??

<br>Of course not. Discussion on the theory of games is certainly relevent to game designers. In fact, I explicitly pointed 
that out in the last(or second-last) sentence of my previous post. As a result, I'd expect many game designers to post 
in the group.
<br>
<br>But. please understand: I want to discuss <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>theory<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> mainly. I am not particularly interested in designing games, making 
money, what makes a game a best-seller, etc etc. Games researchers are interested in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>research<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>: development and 
derivation of theoretical properties (mostly mathematical and computational... but social/psychological as well). The 
focus of the group/community would be therefore on discussions related to this, and NOT primarily about game design 
(like the links you gave me).
<br>
<br>Let's put it this way: I'd like a group called alt.games.theory or alt.game.research.
