If by `supporting evidence', you mean an occasion on which the method
of cheating that I described has been used, of course I can't provide
any supporting evidence!  We are discussing a hypothetical change to
the rules of chess that, to the best of my knowledge, has never been
used in a high-level tournament.

You are permitted to argue by analogy. Really I think if you think about it,
you will conclude that changing the scoring does not create cheating
possibilities
that aren't already present. So the absence of widespread cheating evidence
is meaningful.

Wasn't there a college football game where the headline was Harvard
beats Yale 22-22? I think that if there was a rating system on draws,
where whoever is in the worse position would be credited with an
advantage, would lead to interesting strategies. In a draw, the person
must maintain their disadvantage, although that could lead to losing
the game, while the stronger player can go for the win, or try to have
a worse  position. To prevent chess from turning to crap, this would
be evaluated from the strength of the opponent's position.
