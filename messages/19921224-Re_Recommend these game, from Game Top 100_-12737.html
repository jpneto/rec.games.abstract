Terrace - looks and sounds cool. I really like Abalone, and this
  seems very similar. Anyone play it? :D

This one didn't impress me-- it has Abalone's elegant look, until you
actually touch the pieces, and the game itself isn't helped much by the
board and pieces-- would work almost as well with graph paper and a pencil.
Definitely know what's in the box before buying.

Octiles - Looks neat, but far to expensive... No matter how good it

Quintillions - In the list for 7 years. Based on Pentominoes from 
  Clarke's book. Isn't there an actuly "Pentominoes" game? If so, is
  this better? Either way, how fun IS this game??

Come to the Maryland Renaissance Festival!  Kadon enterprizes (which is
a group of really neat people, from talking to them at the RenFest) has
a booth there where, in addition to selling games, they let you play them
all for a casino fee ($.50-$1).  Octiles really is cute, especially
4-player games, and the game just <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>feels<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> nice, in addition to everything 
else.  These are also the people who make the gorgeous laser-cut wooden
pentominoes, and accompanying 3-d versions, and a matching hexominoes
set (2-d and 3-d).  They'll do a 7's set on order, but it gets awfully
expensive, though the 2-d plastic verison of the 7's is reasonable.
(I asked about special-ordering a 4-dimensional pentominoes set
(pop quiz: how many 4-d pentominoes are there?), and she said she'd do it
for me if I provided the sets of 5 hypercubes to make them out of.)

Incidentally, these people are also very sensitive to the "purity of 
abstract games" concept; for example, in octiles, the set of tiles isn't
arbitrary, it's one each of all possible types (up to rotation, of course).

Hmm-- and looking back, no, really, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>don't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have any official connection
with these people; I just like them...
