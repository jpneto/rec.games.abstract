The pie rule ruins Monkey Queen according to one guy, who happens to be a
good Shogi and Chess variants (and Monkey Queen) player.  The theory is that
the pie rule prevents White (Player 1) from "exploring the depth of the
game".

That's bull.

If exploring the depth of a game requires exploiting a significant initial
advantage, I don't want to explore that game. First move advantage sucks.
It ruins games.

That's an opinion. Others may want to explore the game despite the
initial advantage. A game people like to play can hardly be called
'ruined' in a general sense.

The theory continues,
"Xyz Chess variant has great gameplay but there's an overwhelming first move
advantage and draw rate."

I'm just not buying that.  Robustness and quality of play are two different
things, but they're closely related, I believe.  I don't want a game that
people only want to play if they can move first.

An "overwhelming" first move advantage will not make any game popular.
The magnitude of the errors beginners make at Chess largely
outmeasures the first move advantage. By the time they're pro's it
matters of course, but the Chess community at large doesn't seem to
see it as a problem, nor do the results indicate there's a major
problem (as they do in Draughts).
Regarding not wanting a game that people only want to play if they can
move first, you don't have to make one, nor play one so I don't see
any major problem there either.
