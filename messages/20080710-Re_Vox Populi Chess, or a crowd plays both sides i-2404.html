I do agree, this needs to be tried.  Anyone here want to work to
getting something up?

We could do it play-by-mail. I'm in if we reach 10 people.

Do you want to have someone manually tally everything?

An idea possibly would be to get a forum, have a board displayed, and
have people post their entries on a forum for their turn.  Second side
goes, then everyone would send the moderator what side they are on.

One could use email to record moves.

What we could do now is 3-5 a side and try it without the side
switching and see how it goes.  I am up for having it on the
abstractgamers site or the chessvariants site.  We could actually do
both, communicate via the abstractgamers site (the forum allows for
sending private messages to people), and enter the moves on the CV
site.

Anyone else game?  If I hear some yes here, I will go ahead and set up
something on abstractgamers.org site.
