Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Well, I don't know whether it was just hype or real popularity.  But the
fact that there are pictures of celebrities playing the game is not evidence
for real popularity.  That could have just been a typical publicity stunt,
requiring nothing more than cash to set it up.

Sure, the tournament was sponsored for publicity reasons. Nevertheless,
the fact that these celebrities agreed to participate also means that they
thought the game is worth to be "related" with their names. Your view is
rather superficial. Do you think that all people are prostitutes who do
ANYTHING for money? These celebrities were rich and didn't need any $$.

One of them looks like Judy Holliday.  Another might be Walter Slezak, I
think.  I don't recognize any of the others.  But that's not saying much.

Why do you not simply read the names below the picture. The names are
given below the pic!
