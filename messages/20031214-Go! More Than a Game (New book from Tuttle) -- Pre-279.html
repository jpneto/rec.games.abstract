PRESS RELEASE

Go! More than a Game 

By Peter Shotwell 
Charles E. Tuttle Publishers; Dec. 2003
192 pages; $14.95

Go! More Than a Game will enable beginners to intelligently interact
with anyone who has ever been involved in the game. Beginning with a
unique, abbreviated version of the Capturing Game that gets the reader
playing right away, it uses a patient game- rather than a
problem-oriented approach to encourage development. As the games
gradually progress from small 9x9 boards to 13x13 to the traditional
19x19 size, players will encounter all the basic techniques and
strategies they will need for their own games. They will also be able
to play exciting games on the Internet or at home with anyone because
of Go's unique handicapping system.

But Go is more than a game' and this book is for more than just
learning how to play. Assembled for the first time in one place is the
incredible story of how and why the game has thrived in so many
cultures for so many thousands of years. Besides chronicling the
evolution of playing strategies and styles, the game's roots in
ancient Chinese, Tibetan and Japanese myth, religion and history are
explored, along with illustrations of Go in Eastern art and
literature, and its modern role in mathematics, psychology and
computer science.

Go! More Than a Game is by far the most comprehensive beginner's book
ever published.



Peter Shotwell has been writing about the relationship of Go to
Eastern and Western philosophy, literature, and history for nearly
twenty years and has lived in China, Tibet and Japan while researching
the origins of the game.
