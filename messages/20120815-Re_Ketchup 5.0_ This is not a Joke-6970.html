As metzgerism and Almo have pointed out in the igGC chat, this rule is slightly ambiguous:

"If the largest group on the board (regardless of color) is larger at the end of your turn than at the beginning, your opponent may drop up to 3 stones on her next turn."

It could be reworded like this to remove the ambiguity:

"If the largest group on the board (regardless of color) is larger at the end of your turn than the largest group on the board (regardless of color) was at the beginning of your turn, your opponent may drop up to 3 stones on her next turn."

I was confused when I first read the 5.0 rules because I seemed to remember that you had already reworded this on the 4.0 rules, but I was wrong. I guess it was a false memory...
