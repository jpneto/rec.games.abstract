Name game : Kanibalno

Kanibalno is an abstract game for 2 players based on new capturing system.

Goal : capture all of your opponent tokens to win

Material 

Squared board : 6*6
36 tokens : 18 red 18 blue
Each set of 18 tokens is composed by 6 copies of tokens numbered from 1 to 3.

Setup :
At the setup all 36 tokens are placed randomly

Rules :
Choose who play first 
Blue start the game and then players take their turn alternatively

On his turn a player :
- move one of his token without capture
- or move to capture one of his opponent token

Moves :

Only orthogonal move is allowed (horizontaly or verticaly)
Token are moved like chess rook
No jump is allowed
No passing turn is allowed

Capture :

Capture is allowed only if the token to be captured has a different value than the capturor token.
Examples : 
1 can capture 2 or 3 but never 1
2 can capture 1 or 3 but never 2
3 can capture 2 or 1 but never 3

Only opponent tokens can be captured
No multicapture is allowed
Capturing is not mandatory

The game ends when one of the 2 players has no token to move. 
The winner is the one who annihilated his opponent.

This sounds like a nice simple checkers variant, and should work just fine. But why the change from a non-capturing rook move to a non-capturing wazir move?

How would you categorize it? I admit to not playing a lot of the kinds of abstracts, but it seems to me that it could be most properly categorized as a type of checkers variant with a paper-scissors-rock type of capturing mechanism. 

As for the game play, I lean more toward Mark's first thought that some positions in random set-ups could favor one side but the game is complex enough so that seems like a low probability. (If you completely believed this couldn't happen, you wouldn't need the initial placement phase for expert players, because that would only prevent a random favoring of one side by replacing it with a contest of placement where both sides struggle to get an advantage in initial board position. The only problem there is that could allow a noticeable first player placement advantage.) 

But I'm curious why you reduced the non-capturing move to one step. It seems to me that limitation would be somewhat detrimental to the player who made a non-capturing move on top of the detriment of no capture in that turn..

The capturing mechanism has NOTHING TO DO with Kanibalno.
If you play on a board 8*8 you will use sets of 4 numbers (1,2,3,4)
On 10*10 you will use 5 numbers (1,2,3,4,5) with the same rule : you can not capture a token having the SAME value.
If you want to see how the game is interesting pick 6 positions for each player on a board 6*6 and you will understand how the game works.
Why one square move without capture and why rook move when there is capture..
