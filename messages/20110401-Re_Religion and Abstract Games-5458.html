The arrogant solution?  Buy into a ridiculous fantasy in which you're
essentially an infinite being.  WTF??  You're a fucking primate and you're
going to rot in the ground just like Fido and Fifi in the back yard.   You
bliss yourself out and then arrogantly feel sorry for all the poor slobs who
aren't also blissed out.

That's only one sliver of religion though, the whole of the phenomenon
is more varied and subtle, with parts both vile and delightful (just
like every other human endeavor.) I find it's a nice way to add some
structure to my life, in the same way that abstract games are. They
have some really fascinating and wonderful stories, some fairly solid
psychology sometimes, and yeah a whole lot of bunk but oh well. Lots
of stuff to talk about, interesting stuff, complicated. It's a lot
like abstract games, really. You just have to ignore the assholes who
think their way is the only way, do what you love, and chat about it
with the people interested in chatting about it.
