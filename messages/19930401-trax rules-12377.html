Someone called me asking for the rules of Trax, so here they are:

1 A Trax set comprises 64 identical (red) tiles, with black and white curves
  on one side and b&amp;w straights on the other: 
  
                _________      _________     
               |...| |...|    |...| |...|
               |...| |...|    |__/ /....|
               |#########|    |___/...##|
               |...| |...|    |....###..|    approx 30mm square
               |...| |...|    |...##....|
               |___|_|___|    |___##____|

2 Players take turns to place a tile any way up adjacent to any other tile
  already played such that the colours match.

3 players attempt to create a loop or a line in their colour to win.
  Playing area is limited to 8x8, if all tiles are played without a win
  a draw is declared. A line win is a continuous line that enters and
  exits at oppisite sides of the playing area, 8 tiles apart.

4 Where a tile is played such that a space adjacent to that tile has two 
  lines of the SAME colour entering it, another tile is played in that
  space. (In order to obey rule 2, there is only one way that the tile
  could be played - to join the two lines) This is called a 'forced tile'
  and this rule allows you to play more than one tile in a turn.


  For Example, given this position:

             _________ _________ _________ _________ _________
            |...| |...|...| |...|...| |...|....##...|...| |...|
            |__/ /....|...| |...|....\ \__|___..##..|...| |...|
            |___/...##|#########|##...\___|__ \..###|#########|
            |....###..|...| |...|..###....|..\ \....|...| |...|
            |...##....|...| |...|....##...|...| |...|...| |...|
            |___##____|___|_|___|____##___|___|_|___|___|_|___|

                          /\
   playing this       _________
                     |...| |...|
                     |...| |...|
                     |#########|
                     |...| |...|
                     |...| |...|
                     |___|_|___|

 causes one forced tile on the left and two on the right, resulting in a 
 loop win for black, all being one turn.

 That's pretty much it. There are some special rules for unusual situations
 and a version called SuperTrax which does away with draws by doing away
 with the 8x8 limit (lines must be at least 8 tiles wide and across the
 whole width of the current playing area. You use as many sets as necc to
 achieve a win.

 Incidentally, there is a method for recording the moves to avoid  
 drawing pictures all the time! Late edit: I just saw a posting re someones
 method for describing a game. The now official method requires you to
 describe your play in an &lt;x&gt;&lt;y&gt;&lt;tile&gt; format. eg A5R poasition a5, line
 continuing to right. use C for curves and S for straights when it is
 unambiguous (which straights always are!) obviously A5 refers to the
 position AFTER the tile is played. The only problem is A1. Use A1 for
 left of playing field and 1A for top. Thus the tile played above
 would be B2S.

 The rules are deceptively easy, playing well is a lot harder. The problem
 lies in that defending a loop attack (as white must do above) straightens
 loops into lines, and defending lines bends them into loops.

If you're interested send me a note and I'll send you the full rules. A set                                                              
can be made out of cardboard easily, though I may be able to track down a 
local distributor (if there is one).

Have you seen Trax around anywhere? I am looking for players and clubs for
international tournaments.

To you guys who have replied, I will post you individually if your email
addr have been included.
