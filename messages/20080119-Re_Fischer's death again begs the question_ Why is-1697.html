I have asked this before on here I believe.  Well, the death of
Fischer begs the question once more.  I also posted this on Boardgame
geek:

Bobby Fischer's death is in the news, and causes people to remember
the 1970s, when chess was king, and people tuned into PBS to watch
chess. Chess was a culturally iconic back then. I remember reading Mad
Magazine when I was a kid, and they actually did a spoof with a chess
based superhero. Fischer made all the magazine covers, and it was
WWIII on the board. It wasn't just the Cold War either. When America
beat Russia in the Winter Olympics at hockey, and played them, there
wasn't an outbreak of hockey all over, like there was with Chess. I
remember when I was a kid in the 1970s, there was a chess store that
opened up near where I lived.

So, what has happened here? There is no chess on TV now. Rock, Paper,
Scissors made it to ESPN. Hot dog eating made ESPN. Poker is all over
TV. Scrabble is on TV also. But, there isn't chess. As far as I know,
no one has even bothered to pick up the rights to the World Mind Sport
Games in China either for western broadcast. The event has Chess,
Checkers, Go, Chinese Chess, and Bridge also, and is pretty big event
(first of its kind, and an offshoot of the Olympics). There was a
chess championship for over $1.5 million in Mexico last year, and no
one even knew of it, outside of the chess world.

So, again I ask, why is there no chess on TV?

Two reasons.

One - most of the events on TV are either "everyman" games (everybody
thinks they can play poker) or not as much games as oddities (hot dog
eating).  Even with on-the-spot analysis, 99% of the potential viewers
have no idea why white just moved his queen's knight.  (Chess is not
alone; there has been a national College Bowl championship since 1978,
but it hasn't been on TV since 1987, mainly because the schools don't
want the questions dumbed down for TV and the TV producers know that
nobody is going to watch if they have no clue what any of the answers
are.)

Two - most game championships can be edited into small packages.  The
TV coverage of the Scrabble U.S. Open lasts one hour, as does the
National Geographic Bee; the Scripps National Spelling Bee's finals
run a little longer than two hours on TV, even though it is a two-day
event.  You can't cover the world chess championship like this.

Also note the Fischer-Spassky match had a fixed 24-game limit.  I
think the next few were "first to X wins", which means that they would
have no idea how many weeks it would last.  It's hard to find TV time
under these conditions.
