  This is only semi-related, being about a meta-game, but I really 
enjoyed a boardgame called Proteus, which was a variant on tic-tac-toe 
with the rules on the pieces, and only three rules in effect at any time. 
It was almost impossible to think more than a move ahead, but that was 
actually part of its charm...
