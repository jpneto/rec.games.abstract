Does chess come under the classification of
abstract games ?  Is abstract something that you

Yes, chess can be classified as an `abstract' game (using the definition
of abstract given in the charter).  I don't envisage chess getting much
coverage here, since there is a separate group dedicated to chess,
as there is for go, backgammon, diplomacy and a number of other games.
See the FAQ for rec.games.board for details of other groups.

One definition for abstract games might be: those which are not directly
based on `real life', but perhaps abstract representations thereof.
Chess is an abstract war game, whereas Diplomacy is not so abstract,
being played on a map of the world (and my Diplomacy knowledge ends there).
It's all a matter of degree.

Much more fun to argue about whether particular games can be discussed here!
