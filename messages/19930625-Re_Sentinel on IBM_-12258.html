Sentinel was/is one of the coolest games we have on the Amiga. A level looked 
like a BIG chess board with various areas raised and lowered. The Sentinel 
stood on the highest point, and you usually started on the lowest point. The
view is from your robot body's head, and you can turn 360 degrees horizontally
and tilt nearly 180 degrees vertically. 
    The whole thing revolves around energy. You start with 10 units of energy.
A tree is worth 1 unit of energy, a boulder is worth 2, and a robot is worth 3.
You can create and absorb these things, and that is how you move. To get higher
you create 1 or more boulders by looking at a flat surface like a square or 
another boulder, and then create a robot on top of the boulders. Then you 
teleport yourself from inside your current robot 'body' to the new one. Now
you absorb your old body and any trees or boulders you can see to get more
energy. 
    The sentinel turns around and around and can see everywhere on the board.
When he looks at you he drains your energy one unit at a time and creates trees
randomly on the board. You have to get out of there fast (and preferably a long
way away) and to help you if you're in a real panic there's a hyperspace button
which creates a new robot, positions it randomly on the board, and teleports 
you there. The whole object is to get above the sentinel's podium and absorb
the sentinel. Once he has been absorbed you can create things but not absorb. 
The code for another level is given, that level being the number of the current
level plus however mwny units of energy you have left. There are thousands of
levels.
    The game is great for atmosphere, one of the few I know of to drag other 
people in while watching. Even my Mum gets tense, "he's looking at you... get
out of there.... oh no he's STILL looking at you..". On later levels there are
also sentries, which are like minor sentinels, and the sentinels can do things
like turn a tree into an energy sucker and mean things like that. We have seen
a level with 9 sentries which you have to knock off before absorbing the 
sentinel himself. I don't know if it ever got to the IBM or Mac, but there's 
the info on the game. Now I wanna go home and play it... I haven't for years.
Matt.
