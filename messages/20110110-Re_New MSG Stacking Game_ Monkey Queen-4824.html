Minor tweak: I'm bumping up the initial stack size in Monkey Queen from 8 to
12.  During testing, playing against myself, I was playing ultra defensively
and didn't even realize it.  This will draw the game out and make it
artificially lengthy.  The first time I played against someone else, Greg
Van Patten, he charged out of the gate and played very aggressively.  It
didn't harm the game.  Just made it different.  And it also made us both run
out of checkers quicker.

Another interesting game, Mark, making the most of minimal equipment,
and it should be a game with great clarity, which as I have said
before is a quality I value highly.

I think I would drop the distinction between stalemate and win by
depriving of moves.  The distinction is not all that clear, and if
you're going to award a player a win for leaving his opponent with no
legal move, you might as well apply that rule to all situations,
including "stalemate".  I think having fewer rules is clearer, unless
you have a specific reason for awarding a draw by stalemate.
