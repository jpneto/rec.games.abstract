I can't believe it, he's still posting about Symple! At first I
thought he was just trying to make it obvious that he was ignoring
your provocateuring but he still thinks that anyone is reading this
shit? Christian if you are reading this, SYMPLE is dead. Promoting it
in the Arimaa forum wont work. If you want Symple to be more popular
then I dunno, you're going to have to get an iphone app developed or
something. You aren't just resting on your laurels you're trying to
build an empire upon them. Do I have to say it? sorry not going to
happen buddy.
