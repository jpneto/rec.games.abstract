<br>Define `computer'.&nbsp; It's pretty hard to avoid implicitly taking the

<br>A thing that could solve the halting problem could be called an
<br>oracle for the halting problem.&nbsp; So for each non-recursive function,
<br>one can talk about an oracle for that function.
<br>
<br>Can oracles be built?
<br>
<br>In practice, the input and any output can be bounded by C bits, say
<br>with C = 10^(10^100000).&nbsp; This is equivalent to a large look-up
<br>table, with some "no answer found" lines.

<br>There was an experiment that showed that quantum entanglement
<br>could in some cases evaporate faster than expected:

<br>
<br>As far as I know, that result, if true,&nbsp; wouldn't rule out quantum 
computers...
