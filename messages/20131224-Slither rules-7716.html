I have a doubt concerning the Slither rules. I have always understood that the fundamental rule of Slither should be phrased as follows:

A1) Two distinct chains of the same color cannot be weakly connected (across the diagonals) at the end of the turn.

The rationale is obvious: Weak connection of chains would allow a deadlock.

However, when I recently reread the rules on the internet, it struck me, that the phrasing seems to be rather different:

A2) Two stones of the same color cannot be weakly connected without having a common strongly connected neighbor.

The difference between A1 and A2 is that A1 allows for a chain to loop onto itself with its end stones being weakly connected, while A2 prohibits this.. However I cannot see the rationale for this. It seems to me that A2 is just a poor and inelegant phrasing imposing unnecessary restrictions on the game.

Am I missing something?
