1) How does Chinook do in 11-man ballot against top players?  There
the opening knowledge does not count as much except by transposition.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Most of the top players refuse to play it.  Elbert Lowder is the world
11-man ballot champion.  We have not played him at 11-man ballot.
However, at "regular" checkers, our score is something like 12 wins,
0 losses and 10 draws.

2) Is there a comparable program for pool checkers?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There is a commercial program available that plays pool checkers.
Sage Draughts, by Adrian Millet, plays several variations of 
checkers/draughts.

3) This one is more philosophical.  I know who Marion Tinsley and Don
Laffert are.  There is no identity issue there.  But suppose the Chinook
program source code were licensed (meaning there were multiple copies) and
each was independently improved.  Which one is the World Champion?  I presume
that an improvement of the code (or say additions to its database) 
do not alter its being Chinook.  Nor would moving to a different computer. 
Or does it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Something for the rule-makers to consider.  Right now there is
only one Chinook, with no plans to license it.  We may, however, 
make it available in some form, such as via the WWW.
