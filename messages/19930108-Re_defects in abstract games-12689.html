|&gt; Within limits. Would you argue with the claim that Chess is objectively
|&gt; better than 3x3 tic-tac-toe because the latter is well within (adult)
|&gt; human capability for complete analysis, with no room for psychology?

This is a common mistake, that tic-tac-toe has no room for psychology, merely
because a perfect strategy is thoroughly known by many players.

There is still the question of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>which<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (of several draw-forcing moves) to play;
the "enough-rope" principle (a J.H.Conway coinage) is useful here, but probably
not the end of the story.

Even more controversially, it may be good to deliberately play a theoretically
losing move.  This will be no surprise to players of complex games, but is 
a tenable position even at tic-tac-toe. For instance; if, in the midst of a
series of games (all drawn so far) with a player who seems to know the basic
forced-draw ideas, but hasn't struck you as a terribly alert or really 
knowledgeable player, it may occur that he starts on the side.....
              
  O |   |   ..then you might try this move as your first move as O, (2nd player).
 ----------
    |   |     Although it is a losing play, it has the property that of its 7
 ----------   essentially different replies, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only one<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> forces the win by X, 
    | X |     and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>four<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> allow a win by O.  So if the opponent is unlikely to
              be familiar with the position, (I bet this applies to most readers!)
and unlikely to be interested in mentally working through every possibility,
then you may just score a win, and thus win the series !

(Incidentally, at least 2 of the 4 X-replies are not instantly obviously losing!)

Naturally there is an element of risk !!  

But there is clearly room for non-trivial psychology in tic-tac-toe. The move
by O in the position above could well be called a genuine "sacrifice", to use
a common chess term.
