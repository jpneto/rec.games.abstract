You don't need a board for a game to be an abstract, and of coure
there are plenty of card games demonstrate that quite well.
However, I think there's a point in following pragmatism as well as
notions of "purity", and card games don't need a new special
association for them that lumps them in with GIPF and go, as they
do quite nicely without one.

That is one of the areas I was looking at, and why I was looking to do
an abstract games association, instead of a mind sport or boardgame
association.  While I can see there is room for crossover tournaments,
that feature other games in them (while the predominant games of the
tournament would be abstract strategy games), my desire was to work
with games that have the longest lasting appeal, but have the most
problems in the marketplace, that being abstract strategy games
(typically ones we normally think of).

But if you create an abstract card game that uses its own special
deck rather than a traditional deck I can't see it being readily
adopted by the card game community (says he, who isn't a part of
that community, so it's a sketchily educated guess).

You could do a game based around Freecell.  All cards face up, and
players alternate turns drafting a card of their choice and assembling
the board layout, and then tearing it down.  Possibly have it so that
it is done in the least amount of moves, or most cards put in the
foundation piles.  Would work like an abstract, but not what I
normally would think of here.  Certainly doesn't look like a standard
abstract strategy game to me.  And then, you have a game like Nomic,
which involves making rules with no luck and the players in complete
control.  Does that count?

ISTM that a higher level of definition may be useful, and would get
around this sort of problem.  Although Herman Hesse's fictional
Glass Bead Game doesn't exist, <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>if it did<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> then it strikes me as
being the ultimate abstract strategy game.  But we'd have to rule
it out here becuase there's no board and no pieces.  So perhaps
start the definition off with key elements such as "a contest" and
the "outcome determined by the mental skill of the participnats" or
the likes of that.  That strikes me as far more fundamental, and
probably more useful, than saying "we need a board and some bits".

It sounds like you fall into the "Mind sports" category here which
would end up allowing for Duplicate Bridge to be part of it.
Duplicate Bridge is allowed by the Mind Sports Association and looks
to be played in China next year after the Olympics.  But would it fit
into an association of abstract strategy games?  Doesn't seem like a
fit for me, which is the reason for the rules around equipment being
so and so (pieces in a play area and their position determining
outcome).  You allow a one off for games like Nomic or my Free Cell
game, but that is it, so you don't cause the list of games to spiral
out of control.
