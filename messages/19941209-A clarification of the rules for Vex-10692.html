 From Mike Leigh:

There have been a number of responses to my ideas on Vex, both via 
private mail and through the newsgroup. To clear up to misunderstandings.

The rules of vex are probably best stated as follows. 

A normal game of hex with the second player placing a neutral red peice 
on a position of his choice before the start of the game. This is 
sufficient to make the game fair - ie either player can force at worst a 
draw.

In fact there are three possible outcomes to a game:

1. White establishes a chain of white hexes

2. Black establishes a chain of black hexes

3. Neither side establishes a complete chain but a chain of white and a   
 chain of black peices meet and cross precisely over the neutral hex    
which blocks both chains.

An expect player (starting first or second) will always be able to ensure 
that he either wins (if the other player plays less than perfectly) or at 
the very least draws the game (as in case 3 above).

To make the game perhaps more interesting we can relax the rules to allow 
the second player to use the neutral peice during the game if he so 
wishes rather than at the start of the game.
