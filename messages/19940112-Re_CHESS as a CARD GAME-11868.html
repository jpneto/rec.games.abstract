the goal is to develop a card game,
which can be mapped onto chess
isomorphically.

people who learn the card game and
don't know that such a mapping exists,
shouldn't be able to detect it at once,
but should be impressed of the
complexity of this new card game.

furthermore the card game should have
a simple set of rules (chess isn't
this complicated, either).

That's an interesting idea, but I just can't picture what the card
game would be like.  I have never heard of a card game which doesn't
involve any kind of luck.  I think it would be a necessary property
for our game.  Also, in virtually all card games, a player can see
some cards that his opponent cannot see.  Again, I think this cannot
be true of our game.

I guess you could paint all the regular chess pieces on cards, get
a big enough board, and play chess with your cards :-)
