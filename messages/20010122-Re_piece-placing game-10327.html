I have more experience now...

Random observations:
Equilateral triangles, of course, are bilaterally symmetric. So, one
possible strategy for the 2nd player is to try this mirroring strategy.
The mirroring strategy cannot be done exactly, however, due to the size
of the pieces (ex: the first player can play just slightly off-center, then
a perfect mirror is impossible)

The players can place their pieces along a line of symmetry &amp; try to
control whether the final # of pieces on the line is even or odd

a ratio of D(board side)/d(piece diameter) = 10 or so gives a good game.
The game is long enough to be interesting, and short enough that it can
be played in &lt; 10 minutes. Also, the pieces are large enough that the
first player can make the mirroring-strategy impossible

If you're trying to maximize packing pieces into an area, often the best
play is in the middle of the area, so that your wiley opponant won't hog
tones of the space

Conversely, if you're trying to minimize the final # of pieces in an
area, often the best play is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>near<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the middle of the area, so that you
disallow several moves along the periphery

Playing a true real-valued game is cool - but how the heck would you
annotate it?

You could make your own board &amp; use velcro on the bottom of the pieces.
You would want the pieces to be relatively thick, and you would want a
raised edge around the board.

Even the 1D analog of this game would be nontrivial
