: &gt;There have been a lot of posts recently about Stratego, but none giving the
: &gt;rules.
: &gt;
: &gt;Could someone do this please?   

As far as i remember, each players sets up their pieces secretly,..with 
the picture side facing themselves.

Players take turns moving 1 of their pieces 1 space.
bombs can't move.
A pice can either simply move, or attack.
When somone attacks, each person anounces what sort of piece it was, the 
lower number wins, the loser's piece is removed from the board.
except:

spys can beat one's
8's kill bombs.
in case of a tie, the attacker wins.

oh, and i think maybe 9's can move as many spaces as they want, (but of 
course, this gives away the fact that they are 9's)

The object is to "capture" the opponent's flag, by finding and attacking it.

There may be more....or some of this could be wrong, but i'm pretty sure 
it's right.....
