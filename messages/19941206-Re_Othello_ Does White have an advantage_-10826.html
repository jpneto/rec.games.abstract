Tough question.  In games like chess and Go, it is fairly clear that the
first player has a practical advantage, since it is generally favorable
to have the move; and because (all else being equal) the initial
position is balanced.

Given an otherwise balanced Othello position, it seems reasonable that
having the last move should yield a practical advantage; but this must
be measured against the highly unbalanced (or at least asymmetric) start
to the game.  Perhaps experienced players have an opinion on who holds
the advantage in practice, but the game theoretic question seems rather
muddled.

One interesting possibility is that you are observing a phenomenon that
is strongly characteristic of computer programs.  Search algorithms play
the final phase of the game perfectly, while play in the earlier phases
is considerably weaker.  So perhaps the early suboptimal play on both
sides (from a rather chaotic initial position) leads to relatively
balanced positions in the middle game, which when resolved by perfect
endgame play may consistently result in a win for the last player.

Food for thought...  and yet another example of the need to be careful
when interpreting computer generated results.
