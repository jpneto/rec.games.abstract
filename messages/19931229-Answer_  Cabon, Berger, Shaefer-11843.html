Thanks to all who responded so quickly to my riddle posting.  My
father-in-law will never again match wits with the mass-consciousness
of the internet.  I received a large number of responses within hours,
some suggesting that I was simply being led down the road, other suggesting
that I was overlooking relations so simple as to be obvious (a good 
and reasonable guess), and some proposed that the answer could be exotic,
such as lists of Nobel laureates, employees of the local gas station, etc.
As it turns out the answer is:

Cabon, Berger, Shaefer == "shephard" in various languages.  

In particular, I would like to thank those who responded by Email.

Ross Beresford ---- first person to respond correctly, dated by time sent
Jim Gillogly
Peter Renzland ---- most humorous answer 
Chad Lundgren
Robin at NYU.

Also, thanks to everyone who responded directly via newsgroups.  I would
have been beating my head against rocks for days with this one.
