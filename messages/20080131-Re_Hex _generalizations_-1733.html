I'd like to introduce three families of games that I'm making up on
the spot, some of which I'd consider to be generalizations of Hex that
are not encompassed by Atoll.  Please let the group know if you'd
consider them to be generalizations of Hex, if you'd consider them
encompassed by Atoll, and why or why not.  (These examples are very
simplistic, so you may be inclined to dismiss me as a smart-ass, but I
hope you'll give thoughtful answers.)

These are all variations on Hex.  None of them is a generalization of
Hex.  There's some serious confusion here about what a generalization
is.  The word is being used to describe variations and families of
variations.  If you list a family of games, all of which have one
little item in common with Hex you haven't generalized Hex.

You want to see a real nice example of a generalization?  Look no
further than Atoll.  You have a very succinctly, precisely defined,
infinite set of games.  Every game in the set has all of the central,
defining characteristics of Hex.  Both players are trying to form a
connection between two of their opposite segments.  In a randomly
filled board, exactly one player achieves his cross board connection.
There are a multiple of four of perimeter segments, alternating
between black and white.  It's a two player, equal goals game.  Etc.,
etc., etc.  The only difference between the games in the set is the
number of perimeter segments.  One <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>special case<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is when there are
four perimeter segments.  That member is equivalent to Hex.  Hex is a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>special case<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the more general Atoll.  Is any of this making
sense?

Let's approach this from another angle.  There's this amazing new game
that everybody must have heard of by now called Whopper 100.  You have
a numbered list of 100 games starting with Chess, Checkers, and
Backgammon.  Every game on the list is a two player, turn based game
in which each player has his own uniquely colored set of playing
pieces, and in which captures can occur.  The pieces are moved on or
added to a square grid, one manipulation per turn, possibly resulting
in a capture.  So all of these games have a fair amount in common.

To begin, one of the players, selected at random, rolls a 100 sided
die.  Whatever number comes up, that's the game they play.

Oh, and the really magnificent thing about Whopper 100 is that it's
actually a generalization of Chess.
