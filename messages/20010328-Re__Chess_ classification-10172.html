Hello Ralf. First, thanks for your many insights.

Now, how about speaking of any goal-oriented class
of games through some abstract name related to the
goal or by a short description of the goal and
only <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>in an aside<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> mentioning some well-known game
as a sample member of the class?

I mean, in this newsgroup, you tend to call the
class of games whose object is to capture one or
several pre-defined pieces as "chess variants". Of
course you then clearly explain what you mean. But
explaining is not enough, it sounds anyway like
speaking of mammals as "whale variants" to me, in a
would-be scientific classification of living
beings!

Science strives to find proper centers, when there
are some...

Furthermore, you may need to account for what we
usually mean by 'variants' - an admittedly large
and fuzzy concept of family of games centred on
a given game. How would you call them? 'distant
cousins'? 'relatives'? 'historical or feel-related
derivations'?

It would be much clearer to keep using 'variants'
in the usual meaning and come with a new term for
'games in the same goal-oriented class', if you
ever need such a short term instead of speaking of
classes. I suggest something like 'goal variants'
or 'goal-alike variants', only dropping the prefix
when it is repeated too often and no misunder-
standing may occur. As a side-effect, comparisons
with other classifying systems would be encouraged
and easy to write, your work may spread with less
effort, etc..

In other words, using only 'variants' in your
specific meaning strikes me as another centered
view, typical of authoritarian minds rather than of
scientific minds, while you don't want your work to
be a religion.

Another claim I would like to discuss. Is your
classification as objective as you say? Can we
really find the proper goal class to which a game
belongs without resorting to feelings?

How do you see the gist, the essence of a game's
goal? Through the most-accepted description of the
rules? Sometimes through the majority's feeling,
as you say "according to most Go players [Gess] is
definitely not a Go variant"?

Logically, current Chess is as well about stifling
your opponent, preventing her to move - slightly
complicated with stalemates of course, which you
could put aside as a minor goal. Threats to
capture the king may only be the means. How
science decides?

Go is no less a pure game of capture than a pure
game of territory, isn't it?

What is the main goal of Tanbo? Survival? Captures?
Stifling as Chess? AFAC, I cannot decide.

Logically, Phutball may be seen as a game of
connection as well. Or is it above all a game
about reaching a specific part of the board?
How do you decide the ball is best seen as a
normal piece which players move? And not as the
starting point of an electric circuit for
example? (I am seriously considering it both
ways nowadays, either when playing or when
designing an evaluation function.)

Is trax made of two concurrent goals? Is one of
them about connecting two moving edges, or about
building up a pattern much as the other looping
goal? We could put Trax in the single class of
pattern games.

Without any arbitrary feelings, I am afraid the
logic as you stated it so far isn't enough as a
guide to choose a single goal class. For a mind
accustomed to rephrase formulae, statements,
definitions, or programs in many-faceted
equivalent forms, the goals of games are obviously
hard to canonize.

Of course being out of proportion in this newsgroup
is good to disturb sleeping thoughts and I would
like to dare to speak as sharply as you do - ouch,
indeed I just remember Joao Pedro Neto and a little
me did so in The Hitchhiker's Guide to Chess!
("Chess is a class of games that comply with the
following restriction: There must be at least one
special piece, called King. Each player must
protect his own King and loses if it is captured or
checkmated. [HG2C, page 2]").

Ralf, I don't mean your work is not interesting.
Indeed it looks gorgeous. I only hope your are
going to be lucid and fair in your rational book
and in your claims, more than it feels like here.
Well, I don't really know the extent of your work
and whether you scientifically studied its possible
limitations too. You may not need any advice.
Otherwise be careful please, logic that overlooks
its limitations may overkills - and breed emotional
attacks as well.

Cheers!

Claude
