Life (2-D) is based on an infinite two-dimensional grid, and a "clock"
that counts ticks at some rate (you can decide what you want that to
be).  The game has only two rules that I know of:

1)  If, at one tick, a living cell has fewer than two (2) or more than
    three (3) neighbors (of the eight surrounding cells, natch), it will
    be dead at the next clock tick.

2)  A dead cell will be reborn at the next clock tick if, and only if,
    it has exactly three (3) living neighbors.

Note that just because three cells give birth to a new one doesn't mean
that they won't die in the process, i.e. (. = dead, @ = living):

  .....          .....               ....           ....
  ..@..  becomes .....     while     .@@.  becomes  .@@.
  .@.@.          ..@..               .@..           .@@.
  .....          .....               ....           ....


I got these rules from an old Scientific American article (Computer
Recreations, no date known, try around 1987, author A.K. Dewdney).  The
article focuses on 3-D versions of Life

I've played something very similar to this via modem on BBSs.  It was called
AMOEBA.
