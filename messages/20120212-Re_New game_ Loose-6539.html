Neat idea. In play, do you find it easy to see, at a glance, the
difference between a true and false eye, so that you don't have to
spend much mental overhead distinguishing between the two? This is my
only worry.

For the moment, I have only played twice against myself. In my first
game, I had to stay alert and check the status of every single eye,
but in the second game it soon became close to second nature, and I'm
sure it will get even easier with a little more practice.

I'm also starting to get an idea of the capturing tactics involved,
and I love them: nets, tesuji, capturing races... they're all very
different from Go. But the most important thing to me is that the
balance between life and death seems quite right so far. That's a good
sign.

Otherwise, I love this idea.

Great! Glad that you like it.

I'll try to set up some games in igGC's sandbox shortly. Stay tuned ;-)
