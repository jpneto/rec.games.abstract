Speaking personally, I am very interested in the checkers match news, and would
be disappointed if it were to be withdrawn from r.g.chess.

this came up a little over a year ago when reports of the first/previous
Chinook-Tinsley match occurred.  At that time, there were a significant
number of r.g.c readers interested, for various reasons, not the least
of which is that this match is probably providing a glimpse of things
to come in chess years in the future.

at that time, there were many fewer posts, however.  while I am interested
in this thread, since other r.g.c readers are not, perhaps we should
for the remainder of this thread, keep a standardized subject so
threaded newsreaders and kill files work correctly.  even though
I am following this, it is annoying to have a threaded newsreader
find 3 or 4 separate threads on the subject because of different
subject lines.

how about just "Checkers Championship" as the complete title from now on
for anything cross posted to rec.games.chess?

also, the last time, there was no rec.games.abstract to post to, so
how about if people only cross post to rec.games.chess only things
which are reporting information of the match, and have the followup
line set to rec.games.abstract, and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> discussion takes place in
rec.games.abstract.  if you're that interested to follow the 
discussion as well, you can read rec.games.abstract.
