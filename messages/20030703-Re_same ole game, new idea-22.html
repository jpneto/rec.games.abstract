More notes
*The binary code used to make the characters in the core game design
is simple, and the mathematics behind the reproduction of the new
character is simple. I thought about the breeders in my two player
game and the role of sex in the multi-player games, and, knew that the
code for such a game would be staggering. The code for such characters
would be very much like DNA but represented in binary code, e.g.,
the code is for two characters, one male, and one female. The code is
for only two traits, and it is best to have model of DNA in mind to
understand my idea.
{Male, Gh16725:}
                          |
HHTHHHT {speed} HTHHHTH {4}| HHTHHHT {speed} HTHHHTH {6}
{The dominate trait manifested in game is the one with the higher
value; keep in mind it can be anything of your choosing that decides
the dominate trait}
TTHHHHH {strength} THTHHHH {3}| TTHHHHH {strength} THTHHHH {1}
		             |
{female, Yj54851:}
                           |
HHTHHHT {speed} HTTHHHH {7}| HHTHHHT {speed} HTTHHHH {1}
TTHHHHH {strength} HHHHHHT {0}| TTHHHHH {strength} HHHHHHT {2}
                             |
	{Now with the union of the two characters mitosis occurs and the rest
is known by rereading you high school biology book.
	I forgot some of biology so I call this "the split and spill stage"
The code for both characters splits and forms the new character, and
the code that is not used is spilled, trashed.}


{The new creature, Op72987, now has these two traits:}

{again how the individual traits that are chosen to form the new
character is arbitrary; you pick, coin flipping, traits that have
dominate values, or anything else. For this example I have chosen the
dominate traits to make it easier on me.}
                           |
 HHTHHHT {speed} HTHHHTH {6}| HHTHHHT {speed} HTTHHHH {7}
{above, below from male}                    {above, below from female}
TTHHHHH {strength} THTHHHH {3}| TTHHHHH {strength} HHHHHHT {2}
                          |
This is a simplified version of the process, but you know were it
leads, to wonders unhand. I am tradition and a little old fashion,
i.e., I like colored pencils, graph paper, and pennies to play my
games, and will never get far in further developing "sex games," but
anyone with time, imagination, and a computer can make this recycled
idea of mine and make it work.
*the crude design of the characters can be done with pencils and graph
paper
*the design of the game environment I have not done yet because it
involves games and games and games and more games. I will try to have
the game environment done by this weekend to post on Monday. But don't
expect much, tic, and paper, rock

*I will try have the complete version of my core game design done by
monday to post. It will be simple enough to play with some pennies,
some colored pencils, and graph paper.

*Out of curiosity, I was wondering if it was possible to takes
someone's DNA and put it into a computer, do a little cranking, and,
presto, you have someone totally in metal and digital? It probably
would be risky, too many chances for error. Some solar ray fucking
everything up.
