The best examples of patchworking! 
All is plagiarized. Nothing new at all!  
Luigi87 is a crappy designer. Ayu is the only exception at my knowledge.. I could be wrong about Ayu. I did not make deep research.
Even Ayu needs to be re-ruled more elegantly.

I certainly have nothing against Ayu but I can hardly see why its your "exception". I mean it borrows the spirit of Lines of Action, implements an approaching mechanic similar to Mark Steere's Byte and a transmission mechanic seen in games like Akron. And there is nothing wrong with that, a clever permutation of preexisting elements (metarules) is an intrinsic part of good design. If you want something truly original, Cation is a good example. No game resolves crosscuts in the manner Cation does nor does any game preempt Ko as an exploitable element rather than an adhoc afterthought. The problem with your game design commentary is you have no reason or sensibility, or if you do its completely inscrutable and irrelevant.
