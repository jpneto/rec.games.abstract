In the spirit of straying as far from the original thread as possible:

*Salt Shaker Chess. Good for playing in restaurants. At the start of the
 game, a salt shaker is placed on some vacant square, usually a central
 square. Each time a move is made by either side, the salt shaker moves
 the same distance and direction. No moves are allowed which would take
 the salt shaker off the board. Any piece on the shaker's destination
 square gets captured, even if it's the same color as the side making
 the move. The shaker can "jump" over interposing pieces even if the
 piece it is mimicking cannot.

*Unambiguous chess. No moves may be made which would require more than 3
 symbols to represent in english descriptive notation. The dash does not
 count; e.g. P-K4 is fine but P-KB4 is illegal if P-QB4 is available.
 The x for captures does count as a symbol.

Then there's all sorts of unusual pieces you could add to most any game:
 
*Protean piece. Assumes the powers of movement and capture of whatever
 piece it captures, losing its original powers. You might need an extra
 set for this one. Each player might designate one of their pawns as a
 protean pawn at the start, without revealing which until it makes a
 capture.

*Tank. Same as a rook, plus: if it begins its move adjacent to a same
 color piece, it may move in the direction of that piece, pushing that
 piece ahead of it. It may push any number of friendly pieces this way,
 although they must already be in a line with no gaps before starting.
 If the piece in front "bumps" into a friendly piece, the move must
 stop. The pushing must stop once the piece in front captures an enemy
 piece. You may push your own pieces off the board and out of play if 
 desired.

*Edgehog. Queen, except it must begin or end its move on an edge square.

*Grasshopper. Knight, plus it can continue to move, IN THE SAME
 DIRECTION, like a knight as many "hops" as desired in one move, as long
 as the landing squares are unoccupied.
