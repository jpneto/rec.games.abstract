Vimmy is a simple Vimbre variant which feels like a single placement game. This makes for easier tactics and greater clarity, in the Hex spirit. As in the standard game, draws are impossible. Preference might well be a matter of taste.

The rules of Vimmy are those of Vimbre, with the following exceptions:

a) When a player decides to place two stones on his turn, he must place them on orthogonally adjacent points. Note that it's still possible to place only one stone instead of two.

b) There are no restrictions on Black's first turn, so he can already place two stones on that turn.

c) The pie rule is used to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.
