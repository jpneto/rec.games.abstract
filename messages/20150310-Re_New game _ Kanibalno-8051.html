And let me wrap up this post with a question about the actual purposes of this site. Is this actually a site where people are invited and encouraged to discuss abstracts, or is it strictly a site for the self-aggrandizement of a few, primarily by insulting others?

lol, good question.

A little historical context:

When I first got here years ago, rga was being lorded over by Bill Taylor and other math professors to discuss Nim variants.  I don't remember Taylor ever designing anything while he was here.  Instead he would remind everyone of games he had designed in the past and how they were "the world's simplest game" and other such braggadocio nonsense.  As with the insults, there was never any shortage of self-aggrandizement here.  At my peak I was announcing a new game here like every other month.  Taylor and his cronies would either ignore them, or make some snotty little condescending comment - and then ignore them.

Yes, insults were flying, as they do at every unmoderated site.  An unmoderated site is no place for pussies (not to suggest that you are one).  Long story short, me and Taylor eventually had a showdown, and he left the group, taking his math cronies, who knew jack squat about abstract game design, with him.  After that there was a surge in new game announcements from me, Nick Bentley and a bunch of other guys.  There have been periods of relatively high activity as well as low.  Right now it's pretty much me and Hazen.  I'm just here to shoot the shit since I've burned out on game design.  The other designers have pretty much dropped out too as far as I know.  Case in point, Nick.  He hasn't produced anything new in a long while - just minor tweaks to his existing games.  I think Christian Freeling may still be somewhat active in design but he doesn't come here because he takes self-aggrandizement to never before seen extremes, and no serious designer can stomach that.  I only invited Christian here to help chase out Bill Taylor, and he actually did a commendable job of that (thanks, Christian).  

Hazen is a fairly prolific inventor, mainly specializing in new mechanisms that can be used in other games.  Yes, you will be insulted by Hazen.  You will "win" not with counter-aggression, but with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>succinct<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> persuasive argument.  I.e., (no offense) not treatises or references to treatises.  Nobody has time for that.  If you've had enough, I for one wouldn't blame you.  I would just thank you for stoppin' in.

I would discuss Chess variants with you but I've proven not to be a Chess variant kind of guy.  At least not variants with all the kings, queens, pawns, checkmates, and all the things normally associated with Chess.  If you had a simple game, I'd discuss that with you, but I think you said you're not into simple games.

Hope this helps.  Off to my two hour, Chinese massage.  Ahhh, much needed :D
