Hey guys,

I did for a while a modern abstract strategy workshop at my work.
There was one person (Dave) who came every week and he was inspired to
make a game with some sort of stacking component.  He never made a
game, but I thought,"hmm... maybe I should start a contest on r.g.a."
I'm at work right now and he's in here with his girlfriend playing
games.  I asked him if he would like to be a judge in the contest and
he said that he would be happy to.  He doesn't know any of the
designers personally and is a newly found fan of modern abstract
games.  He's also one of the annoying sort who wins at every game
without much effort, which means that he seems to really digests
mechanics.

I think it's only fair that since he inspired the very thought of the
contest that he be on the jury.  That would make Declan and Dave 2 of
the 3 judges. I have a 3rd person in mind as well.  He is one of the
Hive world champions, an architect and he lives nearby.  One quality
of having everyone here is that they can all play against eachother in
the way boardgames should be played.  Namely, on a board.  What do you
think people?  With the three people in Berlin I wouldn't hesitate to
do the final say in video form for a few reasons. One is that you'd
get to actually see these mysterious people.  Another is that it just
sounds like a fun project to finalize with a video.

Daniel
