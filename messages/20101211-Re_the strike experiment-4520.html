Or are you just here to derail Daniel's thread? You succeeded at that.
But how does it contribute to the games world I wonder?

Cheers Christian.

I have a recorded sandbox session of what I called Charisma although
the name is still not set.  We used Corey's suggested rule and the
game went pretty well.

The rule was an adjustment to the strike rule.  Originally it was
movement+total friendly stones in the groups neighboring the arriving
striking stone.  The tweak was instead to have movement+friendly
neighboring stones left behind.

Here's the game.  Any observations etc... appreciated as always.http://www.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?aid=17417&amp;sid=155977&amp;code=CIVEBE461

I'll be back.  Try not to kill each other in the mean time. ;)

Good name, and Corey's suggestion makes sense. It certainly serves
clarity better than the original helper stones. The game has
intruiging tactics, and shows clear signs of a future outline of a
deeper strategy being possible. Can't see anything wrong with it
either. Good game, congrats :)
