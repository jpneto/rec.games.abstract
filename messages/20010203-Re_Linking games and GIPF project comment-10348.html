Greetings Symbiot,

&lt;&lt; What I am interested in finding out about is any sort of games that involve
a linking of "equal" level games. That is to say, each game is an independent
game and then, by some alteration of rules or additional pieces, the games can
be joined into forming a larger game. &gt;&gt;

Try the idea with 2 Chess boards side by side, and 2 separate, complete Chess
sets.  Each player plays White on one board and Black on the other board.  Play
alternates with both players making one move each on board A, then one move
each on board B, etc.  At some point in the game (determined by what???), the
two boards would become one board (8 by 16 squares), and one player would move
only the white pieces, the other player would move only the black pieces, and
most pieces would be able to cross over from one board to the other.

Harvey
