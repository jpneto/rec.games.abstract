Actually, my text has quite a bit of proof in it and my professors,
both calculus and linear algebra, teach proof during class, as well as
perform very difficult problems so we can see the techniques.  In
linear algebra we're required to prove things both in graded homework
and on tests.

But I'm frustrated because I don't like the rush.  I never have time
to consider what all this means, what he applications are, what the
implications are... it's rush off to the next problem set and memorize
the next problem solving technique.  I'm getting intellectual boredom
just from having to develop the next bunch of pointless techniques.
The more abstract classes are even worse.  I just can't imagine taking
3 months to learn analysis.  It seems ridiculously short.  People have
devoted their lifetimes to the study.  I'm not even going to scratch
the surface in 3 months.

You know, i graduated with my BA in math back in 1991. When
I first took upper division math classes - abstract algebra was my
first upper division math major class and I loved it - no one really
taught me how to write proofs. We'd see the teacher do it in
class but he never actually lectured in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>how to prove something<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

However, many things were just apparent to me. I'd make a guess
about how to prove something and then sit down and try to
write the proof, and yeah, following the logical scheme of things
I'd prove the thing.

the proofs were really long winded and probably very obviously
done by someone who was just learning, but... the basics of
the stuff was there. And I'd come upon a lot of it, a lot of the
major techniques of proof, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>myself<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. So the thing was exciting.

My abstract algebra teacher (I Martin Isaacs of - IIRC- univ of
wisconson, madison - he was visiting at the univ I went to at
the time - he was such a good teacher that one day in class 
while he was lecturing, a guy in the class burst out with the 
exclamation, 'Wow!! This stuff is really exhilarating!!' -hah) used 
to give us each week a homework set that was composed of five 
or six basic but interesting statements of abstract algebra.

We'd have to prove the statements for our homework set.
He didn't really tell us how to do it. He proved stuff in class
and we watched him, though. We just got the problems 
and had to work through them ourselves. So we did - and
people would get together in groups, or work alone, or
whatever enabled them to 'get it' best - and struggle through
the stuff.

It was hairy at times but it was exciting.

so maybe you are spending too much time trying to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>memorize<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
techniques of proof that someone else has lectured you on. maybe
you might want to try to sit down with some interesting mathematical
statement and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>try to figure out yourself<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> how you might go about 
proving it. Then write out the proof in a way that makes sense to
you. Try to twist your brain around the thing and get a handle on it.

There is also this book called, 'How to prove it' or something
like this. I think I have the book but haven't ever really read it. It
contains some hints about basic proof techniques, IIRC. after
you have figured out a few of these proof techniques for yourself,
you would probably sit down with a book like this and go,
'oh yeah - yeah, I understand that. That's what I was trying to
do when I tried &lt;technique you tried in your own attempts at
proving something&gt;.'

If you can try to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>learn and understand<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> some of these basic
techniques then you can get quite a long way from there and
won't have to spend so much time memorizing things - many
things can be worked out by simple proof themselves once
you can piece things together in that way - that means you don't
have to remember <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>everything<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> necessarily, you just have to
remember the basic 'pieces' from which you can easily put
together what you need to know about other things.

But it looks like right now you aren't too intellectually excited
about what you are doing - that is too bad. Can you try getting
together with some other students and talking about the
problems - the statements you have to prove - and trying
to get a handle on <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the basic parts of what is going on<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
with the problems you've got?

Also, if you're still taking lower division classes and
haven't started with any upper division, traditional math
major classes yet, then just hang in there. Upper division
math major classes at a major university with a decent math
department can be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> different - and much more interesting-
than the lower division classes. I get the impression because
you've called your homework assignments 'problem sets', that
you may still be taking your lower division stuff.
