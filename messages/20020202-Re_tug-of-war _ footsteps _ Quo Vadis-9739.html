Hello fw,
  I am just wondering if you understand fully what gamerz.net is.
It is a web-site with rules to many games (about 120) including tug-of-war,
but it is also a PBeM site.  What this means is you can sign up for
an account and then actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>play<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> tug-of-war through email. 
I wonder if this is kinda what you are looking for.  Also, there is an
AI (robot player) at this site if you just want to play against a computer.
Tug-of-war can also be played multiplayer (2 to 4 players IIRC).
One last thing, there are several volunteer programmers at this site who
will program new games that are requested.  I am one of them, I like the
excersize!  :-)   If you want a special version of tug-of-war done, then
just ask and I am sure someone will program it (when and if they have the
time).  BTW: I did Alak which was recently discussed in this newsgroup.
It is rather popular right now on the server, with about 2 dozen boards
active at this time.  :-)    I hope this helps.
