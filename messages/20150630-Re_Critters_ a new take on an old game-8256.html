Take your time, odds are you won't like it anyway. ;) And, yeah, I seem to have 2 IDs here - annoying. I blame google - couldn't be me not keeping up after 31 years of owning home computers*, then screwing up trying to sign in once...

The point of this game is to set chesimals free of the restrictions that made them plod. With games like this you truly have to crawl before you can walk. I did the chesimals games about 8 years ago, and just a few days ago, got sucked back into the design idea. The rules for the game are in two parts. The first half essentially frees the individual chesimals from being plodding sorts of little things to having a significantly greater range and freedom of motion.

The second set is more experimental (than the untried first set of rules, discussed above) and imposes even more of a structure that the Activator rules enforce. It starts to sketch in 2 things, growth of individual chesimals, and an overall ecology based on specific and limited resource points that allow creation or maturation of one subset of units that make up the "bodies" of chesimals. If I'm lucky, someone will actually play a game.
