Hi there,

I've searched online a few places that I can join some Nomic
discussion. I've only found the Agora discussion list and
alt.games.nomic.* (which is dead due to large amounts of SPAM it
seems). Most resources point to this newsgroup, so maybe someone in
here would be willing to help me with a question I have. I hope you
don't mind my posting.

Normally Nomic discussion takes place on the Nomic Bulletin Board [1]
but the machine it runs on is currently down. It should be back soon.

Here's 2 situations of a Nomic game. It seems that these loopholes
might arise and I'm wondering if I've misinterpreted something (or
just that a certain level of honour is expected when playing).

It's not so much honour, as an agreement to actually abide by the
rules. Both the examples you cite contain deliberate gross
misinterpretation of the rules. If players are willing to do that,
then they're not really playing the game, are they? Why should the
other players abide by their judgements if they do? It all comes down
to a childish argument of "I shot you.", "No you didn't.", "Yes I
did.", ...

Of course occasions will arise when the rules are legitimately
ambiguous and players will take different stances on what
interpretation they should take. In that case it might be advantageous
to find a sympathetic judge who can be convinced to rule in your
favour. But remember that if other players do not believe in the
legitimacy of your judgement then you will have trouble convincing
them to follow your interpretation, unless you can somehow coerce
them.

In Nomic games I have played in, protecting the legitimacy of the
courts has been paramount. Disagreements over rules can usually be
resolved as long as players agree to abide by the decision of the
judge. But as soon as the judge's legitimacy is called into question,
all hell breaks loose. I have seen several examples of this.

The very first scam in Nomic World MUD exploited exactly this problem.
In the original ruleset, the judge's power of interpretation is quite
wide-ranging. Lindrum was chosen as judge on a rather minor issue
(which has been long forgotten) but used eir power to radically
reinterpret the entire ruleset. Some would say "mis-intepret". In
fact, many did.

Lindrum gave emself dictatorial powers. There was a major division in
the game. Factions arose between those that thought Lindrum's actions
were legal and those who did not. Neither could agree, because they
fundamentally disagreed on how to establish a definitive answer.
Eventually the game descended into chaos and had to be restarted by
the wizard of the MUD, by fiat. Interestingly enough, neither group
recognised the wizard (Geoff) as having the legal power to do this.
But in practical terms, it was Geoff's MUD and e had the power to pull
the plug if e so desired. So eir decision prevailed.

There is more about Nomic World and the Lindrum affair on the
NomicWiki [2], but alas, that is also on the nomic.net machine which
is currently offline. Hopefully it will be back online soon.
