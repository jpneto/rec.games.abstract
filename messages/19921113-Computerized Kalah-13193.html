Kalah not being a particularly well-known game, the only opponent I have
around here is a computer program I hacked out for my PC. And, while it
plays a good game, I'm interested in improving its algorithm. Currently,
the programs relies on an alpha-beta search and a static position
evaluator, but both the search and the evaluator could use some
improvement.

Here's the way they currently work. The static value of a board is
determined by simply taking the difference between the number of stones
in your pit and your opponent's - the higher the value, the better.
Meanwhile the alpha-beta search uses a window originally defined by
                      ALPHA = 2 * MY_SCORE - 72
                      BETA  = 72 - 2 * HIS_SCORE
where MY_SCORE and HIS_SCORE are the number of stones in my and his score
pits, respectively.

The problem is, especially with the values of ALPHA and BETA, that
they're not very precise. Clearly, the final score of the game must
always be between ALPHA and BETA, but they provide a rather weak
limit, since they correspond to the two situations where your opponent
wins all the remaining points and you do. So what I'd like to know is,
does anyone have any suggestions about how I could either a) improve
ALPHA, BETA and the evaluator, or b) change the algorithm from
alpha-beta to something that would work better.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.
