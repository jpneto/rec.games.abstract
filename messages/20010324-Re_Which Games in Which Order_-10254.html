I recently purchased what I think is a good selection of abstract games for
a beginner like me:

Nice selection!  You might want to add Pylos to the list at some point.

I would suggest:

Zertz
Octi
Cathedral

As a first pass - all should be quite balanced when played between
beginners.  As Panther noted, Go is a very deep game, but two beginners
will be flailing around at random unless given some tuition, or given
some books to read.  Cathedral has similar objectives, but the strategy
is much more obvious.

Zertz does play very differently with experienced players than with
beginners, but that shouldn't stop you from having fun!  As for
Panther's comment: 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
For experienced players Zertz will eventually only consist of an 
opening and an endgame phase.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
... this tends to be true when one player is more experienced than the
other.  Any mistake can be fatal, but if both players are patient, then
the middle game can be present, and very tense.

TTFN,
