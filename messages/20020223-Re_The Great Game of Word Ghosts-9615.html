I forgot to add some Additional Supplementary Rules

A coin is used to decide who goes first in the first round.

A challenged player must reveal the secret word he/she has in mind.

Examples of Valid Challenges:-

"You are bluffing"
"Word non-existent". "You are trying to make a word which does not
exist".
"You have misspelled that word".
"You have made a complete word"

If it not already clear a round ends after a challenge has been made. 

Valid words are those found in a good dictionary: Webster's Third
International, the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, Chambers Dictionary
etc..

Word not permitted are those beginning with a capital letter (i.e.
proper names), foreign words, abbreviations, words requiring
apostrophes or hyphens. All grammatical aspects of words are
permitted, e.g. plurals, present participles, past participles,
comparatives, superlatives etc. etc..

Forbidden Starts
a) At no time may a player start a round with the combination

                     XQ

XQ is forbidden on the grounds that all resulting words are entirely
under the control of the starting player. Only the following words can
be formed from this combination:-

EXQUISITE
EXQUISITENESS
EXQUIRE
EXQUISITELY
EXQUISITIVE
EXQUISITIVELY
EXQUISITISM

b) In a game of 10 rounds it is forbidden to use the same combination
of the two starting letters twice in the same game.
