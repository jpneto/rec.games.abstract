   My friend and I have been trying to put together a program that plays
   greed. We have had some success, but the scores that our code can
   produce don't even come close to what any human player can manage.

   We were wondering if anyone has heard of any other attempts at producing
   an `autogreed'.

My first idea was just random trys and pick the best, then I thought
perhaps some simulated annealing on top of that, then I figured, how
hard would it be to try every possible combination of moves?
