New game: VOGO

Vogo is a two player game. The square board starts out empty. The two
players, Black and White, take turns placing a stone of their own
color on an empty intersection of the board. Black plays first.
Passing is not allowed.

A territory is a group of one or more empty intersections which are
orthogonally adjacent to each other (as in Go). A territory is said to
be surrounded when none of its intersections are part of the board's
edge.

After the placement of a stone, if there are any surrounded
territories on the resulting position, each one is filled with stones
from the player who has more stones orthogonally adjacent to it, thus
ending the player's turn.

The game ends when there are no more placements available. At this
moment, whoever has the most stones on the board wins.

(Please note that corner intersections are effectively useless, and
thus can be removed from the board.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One possible problem with Vogo is that small boards might not allow
the creation of surrounded territories with sound play. To fix this,
one could modify the rules and state that:

a) There are two kinds of pieces: stones and settlers. Only stones can
be placed on the board except when filling a surrounded territory.

b) Intersections in a territory can be empty or occupied by stones
(not settlers).

b) A territory is said to be surrounded if it does not limit
orthogonally with any settler, but only with regular stones.

c) Surrounded territories are filled with settlers of the
corresponding color.

Maybe this would complicate things too much and make gameplay feel
somewhat less intuitive. I don't know if the increase in
"surroundibility" would compensate for it, at least in big boards.

Anyway, my main worry about this game (and its variant) is the fact
that it could end up being trivial. I guess it usually happens with
most simple game ideas. Any thoughts?
