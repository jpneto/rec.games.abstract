We've just finished our new book Net Games--a guide to the world of online
games. It's stuffed with addresses and hints for playing games over the
Net from chess to Doom to FurryMUCK. We've put up a sampling of pages from
the book as GIF's that can be downloaded from <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="ftp://www.ypn.com/pub/pages">ftp://www.ypn.com/pub/pages</a>.
Feel free to upload these pages anywhere on the Net. For more information

writers (we even pay!).

Here's the press release that the publisher, Random House, sent out:

New Book Charts Entertainment Revolution

What's Playing in Cyberspace?��

Net Games, a new release from Random House Electronic Publishing and
Michael Wolff &amp; Company, Inc., is the first book to document the
revolution taking place in interactive entertainment--at any hour of the
day millions of people worldwide are online playing games with each other
in Cyberspace.�

Most do not know each other. Few will ever meet each other. And yet,
online camaraderie and competition rival the intensity of contact sports.
Night after night, old hands and newbies meet at the electronic equivalent
of parks and sandlots where they blast away at each other, sit on opposite
sides of chessboards (with thousands of miles between them), or create
elaborate adventure worlds together. Not only do the players fiercely
compete, but as they play they talk (or type back and forth), bragging,
complaining, and sharing their lives.�

Where the first generation of video games pitted human against computer,
the new breed of games takes advantage of the Internet and other computer
networks to bring human rivalry and team spirit directly to your screen.
Net Games is a guide to more than 1,500 of these new computer games,
including: ��

- Multiplayer virtual scrimmages like Air Warrior, Cyberstrike, Doom, and
Bolo, which combine the local color of a hometown bowling league with the
massive firepower of a Hollywood action movie;��

- Chess, go, bridge, backgammon--even Jeopardy--servers that function as
anytime, anyplace meeting spots for novices and masters alike to get games
going at any moment of the day--or night;��

- MUDs, MOOs, and MUSHes--participatory narrative adventures (the true
post-modern novel)--wherein players build and explore virtual worlds from
gaslit San Francisco to the USS Enterprise, from worlds based on Anne
Rice's vampire chronicles and sci-fi classics like the Dune series, to
FurryMUCK, an anthropomorphic world where players experience polymorphous
pleasures. (There are more than 400 virtual world games which, at any hour
of the day, have as many as 200 players!);��

- Play-by-mail strategy classics like rotisserie baseball and Henry
Kissinger's favorite game, Diplomacy, that travel over email lines.�

By some estimates more than half of online time is spent playing
interactive games. Indeed, games are proliferating around the Net at such
an astonishing rate and are gaining so much popularity that some
universities have begun to control the bandwidth games take up on their
mainframes. On commercial services, games are one of the fastest growing
offerings. GEnie players of Air Warrior, a flight simulation game, have
spent up to a $1,000 a month. It is no coincidence that shortly after
Rupert Murdoch bought Delphi, he also bought Kesmai, one of the largest
producers of online games.�Besides the games people play online, Net Games
also covers the thousands of free computer games and demos that people
download from online archives and the modern-day mutual aid societies that
share cheats, hints, and walk-throughs for mastering home and arcade hits
ranging from Mortal Kombat and NBA Jam to Sim City 2000 and Doom (and even
the daily crossword puzzle).��

Net Games, the second book in the Net Books Series, is by the creators of
Net Guide, the best-selling guide to Cyberspace that Wired editor Louis
Rossetto called "the TV Guide to Cyberspace," and USA Today called "the
liveliest most readable online guide yet!" In addition to Net Guide and
Net Games, the Net Books Series includes:��

- Net Chat, a map of salons and meeting places in Cyberspace, to be
published in �November;��

- Net Money, a handbook for using online personal finance resources, to
appear in time for tax season in January;��

- Net Trek, a directory of the online Trekkie universe, to arrive in
bookstores in March.� ��
