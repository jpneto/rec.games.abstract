Actually, there is another rule: If a pawn is at the 9th rank, and the
person with the pawn still has all his pieces, the pawn can not move to the
10th rank, but can put a king on the 10th rank in check (this probably won't
happen very often, but...)

Another game: Shantraj. This is a predessor to chess, popular in ancient
Islamic countries (the read Alladin, for example, played this game). The
setup and board is the same as our version of chess, but there are some
differences:

-The pawns can not move 2 squares in their first move
-There is no castling
-The queen and bishop move like like Chinese Chess's guard and minister, sans
palace and river restrictions. In other words the queen can only move one
square diagonally (much less powerful that our queen), and the bishop can only move precisely
2 squares diagonally, but can jump over pieces, like our knight.

Looking at the source code of GNU chess, it should not be too difficult
to modify GNU chess to be able to play this game.
