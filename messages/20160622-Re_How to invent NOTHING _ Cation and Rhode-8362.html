If you play 100 games of Cation be sure that the first player (black) will be winner in at least 80 games.
Is this game?
It create more problems than it solves.
Even the example given by Luis in 4x4 grid is a staged one! 
Are you dumb to accept a perfect play with systematically one unique move per turn? What about moves equally perfect (2 or more)?
ABSURD!!! YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE ABSURD WITHOUT ANY COMMENT.
Is saying that "Cation is a big one indeed" a relevant comment? WHY IS IT THE BIG ONE? Who cares about Dieter Stein comment a crappy game designer? 
YOU ARE ALL GUILTY OF DISHONESTY AND COMPLACENCY!!!
NOT ONE OF YOU (MEMBERS OF BGG FORUM) IS HONEST ENOUGH TO TALK THE TRUTH.
