Christian Freeling ranted in the Arimaa forum:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm too pissed off. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why is Christian so pissed off?  The usual reason.  He pulled his "Symple, the perfectly balanced game" nonsense in the bgg combinatorial games contest, he got called on it, and he had a complete temper tantrum.  Major meltdown.  Yanked his game out of the contest.  Ironically, it turns out Symple wasn't eligible anyway.  The criteria was "games published in 2011 and 2012"..  Symple was published in 2010.  Christian's game was clearly ineligible, but he desperately tried to sneak it in anyway.  

During the brouhaha over Christian's "perfect game" nonsense, it came to light that he had violated the integrity of the contest.  After he withdrew Symple, I re-entered it, and then the contest organizer disqualified it, tossing it out again.  Christian embarrassed himself by getting caught in two major untruths about Symple - it's alleged "perfection" and its eligibility for the contest.

The difference between Christian's dogma (Symple, the holy grail of games) and mine (finite games rule) is that my dogma is just for me and those who choose to believe it.  If you don't believe it, I don't care.  Christian's dogma is more than just dogma.  It's pseudo-science.  It's a hoax on which Christian stakes his reputation.  If you call him on it, he falls to pieces..  He can't stand having his dogma questioned because he knows it's a lie - one that withers in the cold light of day.  

Why the big "Symple the holy grail" charade in the first place?  Because Christian can't accept that his time has passed.  There'll never be another Havannah.  Other designers have arrived and grabbed big chunks of the pie Christian once owned exclusively - like me, Corey, Nick, and Luis - each of us pounding another big, rusty iron spike into Christian's coffin.  

Why is it all so unbearable, Christian?  Everyone's time passes.  Your deluded Symple fantasy only makes it harder.  "No wait!  I'm still great!  Don't forget my famous intuition!  Doesn't anyone see how fabulous Symple is??  Why will nobody defend Symple against Mark Steere, the unstoppable Terminator??"

Some things need to be terminated, Christian - your unrelenting Symple-the-holy-grail campaign being a prime example.  You were a good designer, Christian.  You've got a couple of good games under your belt, all anyone can hope for.  But Symple is straight up shitty.  Nobody wants to play it.  Ever.  Yes, your Dutch cronies have programmed it for you out of misguided reverence and pity.  The fact remains, Symple sucks.  Let it go, Christian.  Let it go.
