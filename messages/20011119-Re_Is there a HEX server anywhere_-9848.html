|Yeah, that was my take on it, and it is kind of a bummer (though with some

You're absolutely right, Java is a far superior choice to Virtual
Basic, which is what I think was used for the VGC software. Not only
is it platform-independent, but it's more robust as well, meaning
you probably wouldn't get the flaky behavior that VGC currently
exhibits. To be fair, this might be due to the specific service
provider where the server 'resides.'

There IS a Java Twixt program available at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.xmission.com/~kwalker/jgame/README_twixt.html">http://www.xmission.com/~kwalker/jgame/README_twixt.html</a>

It doesn't play the game (yet), but it serves well as a game display
and move tree traversal tool. You can save games and positions.
It does automatic linking with a manual override option. Hopefully,
it will someday also have TCP/IP client/server functionality, so
people can play over the internet.

In the meantime, it is possible to play Twixt "live" even if you
have a Mac or Linux platform. AOL Instant Messenger allows people to
send images to each other directly. This is more than just file
transfer; the image will appear in the IM window. So, with a graphics
editor you can generate an image of the board (perhaps capture the
image from the Jtwixt board) and send the updated image back and forth
as you play. It's tedious, but it has been done. AOL IM is free at

Of course, this presents a way to play other games as well.

If you'd like to try AOL IM Twixt against me, I offer to send update
images after each move, so my opponent would just need to tell me the
coordinates of the moves. I also offer handicaps; details available
on request. My userid on IM is hextwixt.
