Can anyone give me some hints for strategy or tactics in nine men's
morris? Playing against Zillions of Games at expert level with three
seconds for the computer to choose its move, I lose all the time. I
know it's great if you can shuttle a piece back and forth to make a
mill on each turn, but that's about all I know of strategy or tactics
for this game.

I can't find any hints for good play on the Internet. Every time
someone asks, someone else tells him that the game has been solved (as
a draw). I don't care if it's been solved. I want to know how to play
better. The person who solved the game says he doesn't know.

Doesn't anybody play this game any more? I played it a little many
years ago, but always with people that I had taught the game to. I
think it's a good game, perhaps especially for children, but also for
adults, even though it doesn't have the depth of go or chess, and
probably not of backgammon or international checkers, and maybe not
even of English checkers.
