Hi,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Another websites with lots of rules for abstract games is
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com">www.zillions-of-games.com</a>.  Even if you don't have the software the majority of
the games list the rules and the set-up.  There are hundreds of different
games,

I know this site. Some games are very good, but there is a major drawback
with this site: Karl Scherer!



1. Salta

Karl Scherer is rather incompetent to put it mildly:

Jumping over your own pieces was NOT allowed in the original game.
A stalemated player doesn't win. It's just not allowed to stalemate your
opponent. Red 4 must NOT end up at the starting square of Black 4. Correct
ist Black 2. I have a booklet from 1902 (the game was invented in 1899),
so I know, what I say.



2. Queen's Guard

The rules of Queen's Guard has been deliberately changed by Scherer
because the correct rules couldn't be implemented by using Zillions.


3. Windmill

The correct name of the game is according to Werner Hirte's book
(Scherer's source!) "Rautenmühle". Karl Scherer deliberately changed the
name (because he didn't like it?). Perhaps Scherer cannot read. Hirte
clearly stated that a piece which is part of a mill may never captured.
I just bought Hirte's book.


In German: Scherer is a "Spielverderber".


Zillions might be good, but never ever trust Scherer.

Ralf
