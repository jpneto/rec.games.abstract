I really do appreciate Luis' input on the Redstone design.  I snipped out the "cancerous eyes" feature upon his recommendation.  There was some discussion on iggc recently about Luis being considered a "co-designer" for that, and I'm sorry but I don't feel that a post-design tweak rises to that level, however much it may have improved the gameplay.  I believe that any serious Go player would have recommended against cancerous eyes, and there'd be no occasion for Luis to "let the concept die a natural death", as he's vowed to do next time around.
