There are plenty out there.  Each try to do different things.  I don't
believe the future of chess will be in a single game personal.  FIDE
chess is set.  But I do believe that a handful of games, going in
different directions, can be adopted.  What I see of interest in his
variant is that it provides a stable way for chess to grow, and add
new pieces, as time goes on.  This is what piques my interest about
it.  This approach can work with any chess like game also, like with
Shogi reverting back to its original form and the Rook-Bishop pieces
coming on the board the way that laid out by Seirawan-Harper.  This
method can work with Chess960 also, and a bunch of other games.  It is
a way to do Capablanca Random Chess, without needing a bigger board.
There is also the risks when you play on the 10x8 board that the
Gothic Chess Federation will sue you if you do anything that comes in
range of matching their patented configuration.

       Also, there's no need to rename these pieces - they already
have plenty of names. Check out the Piececlopedia on the Chess Variant
pageshttp://www.chessvariants.org/index/mainquery.php?type=Piececlopedia&amp;o...
for the Empress, Marshall, Chancellor (Rook-Knight combo), and
Princess, Archbishop, Cardinal, Paladin (Knight-Bishop combo).

I will say that this needs to be ironed out, the standardization of
names.  As tournament play for variants gets established,
standardization of names, and so on, should come about.  That is
actually one of the objectives of IAGO is to help with the
standardization of the naming of pieces.  IAGO is relying on people
involved with the chess variants site for this.

As for this particular case, if Hawk and Elephant do get adapted, I
would suggest they be the name for the POCKET version of the
Chancellor and Archbishop.

I will add here, I also believe there should be a standardized/top
form of chess that will continue to adapt and change its rules every
few years.  Pretty much, the moment they start writing books to
analyze how it is played, you change the rules.
