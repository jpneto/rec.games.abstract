I have the rules for a game I created that is a cross between
Spades, Euchre, whist and other games of this kind.  An advantage of
the game is that it can be played solitaire, or with 2 or more
people.  I am looking for some people to playtest the thing some more
and give me feedback.  If you are interested in receiving a copy of
these rules, please send me email requesting it.  Depending on the
response, I may limit then number of the set of rules I send out.
So far, response to the game has been very favorable.
   Send email to me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kvvp@maristb.marist.edu">kvvp@maristb.marist.edu</a>.

Now, if I get a SASE and like a $1-$2 enclosed then I am sure I
will send out a copy of the rules to a person ;)

My address, by the way is, if you are interested:
Richard Hutnik
30 Johnson Road
LaGrangeville, NY 12540
