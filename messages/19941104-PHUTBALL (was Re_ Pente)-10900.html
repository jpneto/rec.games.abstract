It's described in "Winning Ways", vol. 2, by E. Berlekamp, J. Conway,
and R. Guy, ISBN 0-12-091102-7, page 688 (the book claims this is the
first in-print description of the game).  J. Conway claims to have
registered the nickname PHUTBALL for this game.  Can be played on a
Go board (19x19) or a 15x19 board.

Start with a black stone in centre of board.  Players alternate turns.
On your turn you can either:

	- Place a white stone on a empty grid intersection

OR

	- Jump the black "football" over a continuous serious of one
	  or more white stones vertically, horizontally, or diagonally,
	  removing the jumped stones IMMEDIATELY;   Repeat this step as
	  long as you wish (you're not forced to do multiple jumps)

You win if the football ends up, after a turn is completed, on or over
your opponent's goal line---i.e., it is legal to jump off the board
(ending the game), provided you do it on one of the ends, not the side
of the board.  You can use your own goal line in a series of jumps
without losing, as long as you don't finish your turn with the football
on your goal line.

Note that the black "football" stone and white "player" stones are neutral.
