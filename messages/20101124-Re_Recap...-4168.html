I'm interested in why you see the possibility of a draw as a bug.
Drawishness is another thing, but an occasional draw ... ?

Ties aren't a huge big deal, though they too suck.  It's the endless cycle
that tortures me.

Let me try to recreate the draw moment from 18 years ago.  I have the memory
of a fruit fly, but it was such vile trauma that it made an indelible
impression.

The first thing to note was the rivalrous atmosphere.  Yes, everyone came to
my apartment, or a neighbor's apartment, to smoke pot, on the one hand.  But
when it came to the game, it was bloodsport.  Quadrature is essentially a
game of annihilation, though sometimes you win by slipping through and
getting three guys in the far goal area.  "Winning the race" like that isn't
nearly as satisfying as winning by annihilation.  You only beat your
opponent.  You don't kill him.

The material advantage (how many more pieces you have than your opponent)
can flip back and forth in Quadrature, and the flip magnitude can escalate.
It can oscillate wildly right before someone's army totally explodes. 
Gladiator mentality prevailed on "Quad night".  Someone was there to die, to
be sacrificed to the god of humility.  Tempers would frequently flare.  Time
for another joint.  (reminds me...  brb)

Me and a friend were playing Quadrature one afternoon.  Fortunately we were
the only two in attendance.  The game started taking too long.  It was a
convoluted aggressive exchange that wasn't moving forward.  My opponent was
the first to say something.  At first I didn't believe it but after a couple
more moves in the cycle it was clear we were having a draw.  It was totally
embarrassing both that I didn't even know there could be a draw, and that
there was now something wrong with my great game that everyone seemed to
love.

We're left sitting there like, Now what the fuck do we do?  Suited up, ready
to die, and battle already well under way, our gladiator event is suddenly
cancelled due to rain.  Crap.

In Havannah draws are interesting because they're so rare.

We may have to agree to disagree on this point, Christian.  I've been having
this argument with a lot of people for a lot of years, and the notion of the
"rare, interesting draw" continues to elude me.

Symple cannot end in a draw, Sygo can, yet Sygo is the better game.

Now here we can agree to agree, in principle.  Quadrature is really one of
my best games if you're ok with rare draws.

So the mere possibility of a draw doesn't worry me all that much.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A couple months back, I was wasting time playing Checkers online, and there
was a precise moment when we crossed into the waltzing phase - kings chasing
each other around the board.  I felt a physical welling up - a desperately
unpleasant sensation akin to acute claustrophobia.  I couldn't shut the
fucking game window fast enough and run outside to gulp fresh air.  No time
for a pleasant exchange of gg's.  Panic was setting in.  Cya!

I've got an extremely low tolerance for boredom.  My life is going by and
I'm sitting here pointlessly shuffling pieces around in an endless cycle. 
Just a half second of that and shoot me.  Some people share this
"affliction" with me and some people don't.  If you don't, you're not really
there for the game.  You're just there for the much ballyhooed "good times",
independent of whatever game you're playing.
