Conversely, Luis, why are you inclined to believe that such a large, unoccupied area would lead to a draw?  Why not look at smaller areas?  A draw would occur with only two spaces remaining, right?  I would look at various permutations of two remaining spaces and surrounding tokens on tiny boards - barely large enough to contain the two spaces and maybe a few surrounding tokens.  

Logically, if a draw can't occur in a tiny area then it also can't occur in a larger area that will eventually shrink to a smaller area.  Right?
