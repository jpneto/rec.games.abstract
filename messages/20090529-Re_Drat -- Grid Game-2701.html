Joshua.Zucker in an email has kindly pointed out that in a two person
game, where both players start in a corner with the same parity (same
color on chessboard), then the second player to move cannot win.
(Well, duh!...)

A simple fix is to allow diagonal moves, I am guessing. Does allowing
diagonal moves keep this game from being stupid (stupid in the one-
player-can-always-win sense)?

Here is the game written up with the rule-change:

Here is a game played on a n-by-n grid drawn on paper. The game is for
2 to 4 players. The size of the grid (n) should be relatively small as
far as my games go, n = 4 to 6 for a 2-player game.

In the first phase of the game players take turns, each placing ANY
integer from 1 to n^2 into any empty square of the grid on a turn.
(The same integer may be used more than once in the grid.)

In the second phase of the game, each player has a marker (each marker
is small enough to fit inside a single square of the grid). Each
player places his/her marker in a different corner square at the start
of the second phase.

Players move in a predetermined order (such as clockwise by which
corners the players start the second phase in).
The first player to move moves to any orthogonally (above, below,
right of, or left of) adjacent square.

Players thereafter take turns moving their markers from square to
orthogonally adjacent square.

Say, the last player to move (whom we will call "player A") moved from
a square numbered j to a square numbered k. Then on the next player's
(Player B's) move, Player B MUST move, IF it is possible, to a square
such that GCD(j,k) equals GCD(p,q), OR such that <code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>j-k<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code> = <code class="moz-txt-verticalline"><span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span>p-q<span class="moz-txt-tag">|</span></code> --
where p = the number of the square Player B was on, and q = the number
of the square Player B is moving to.

In other words, if it is possible, player B must move so that the
numbers of his/her consecutively-moved-on squares have either the same
greatest common divisor or same absolute difference as the last two
consecutively-moved-on squares of Player A -- where player A is the
player who moves just before player B (and where who exactly are
players A and B changes each move -- player B always being the player
currently moving).

If there are no such adjacent squares that have the same GCD or
absolute difference, then player B may move to ANY orthogonally
adjacent square.

If a player is forced to move onto a square already occupied by
another player's marker, then the SECOND player to occupy the square
is removed from competition, and his/her marker is removed from the
grid. (A player landing on an already occupied square is a 'drat', as
in "Drat!".)


Play continues until there is one remaining player, who is then the
winner.

Note: In the small number of trials where I played myself, it seemed
that all games are either long or short, but never middle-lengthed.
Maybe some other math rules, besides GCD or absolute difference, would
perhaps make this a more fun game.
