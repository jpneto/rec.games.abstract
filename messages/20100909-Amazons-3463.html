I don't hate all games except my own.  I even hate some of my own
games.  One game, not of my own design, that I don't hate is Amazons.
What I do hate is chop shop "design" that hijacks Amazons' defining
mechanism.

Everyone's a designer now.  Connection games design is interesting and
can be somewhat easy compared to non-connection game design.  Puke on
a Hex board and you've practically designed a new game.  No, that
wasn't an insult directed at any particular game.  I'm just saying, I
think we're getting a little saturated with Hex variants at this point.
