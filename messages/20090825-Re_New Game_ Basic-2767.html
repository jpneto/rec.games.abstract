Of course it is also possible to design finite games where backwards
movements are allowed in at least some circumstances, so there's
nothing inconsistent with your design principles in the idea of
backwards movement.

Agreed.

Your own game Dipole bears this out, though I
realize that Dipole, with its two kinds of movement, doesn't satisfy
the simplicity constraint as well as you would like.

Still, it may be possible to to satisfy the simplicity constraint and
still have a movement rule that allows for backwards movement.

Agreed.  In the case of Basic though, I accidentally happened upon a
game that was unimaginably simple, way beyond my expectations.  It
more than just satisfies a constraint.  It turns the constraint on its
end.  I couldn't have purposely designed such a simple game.
Seriously, it had to happen by accident.  When you have a game that
simple, its game tree only matters if it's small or flawed.  There's
nothing you could do to Basic that would make it any more basic,
without destroying it in the process.
