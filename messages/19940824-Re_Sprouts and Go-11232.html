2&gt;  Go with passing.  Awhile ago a go variant was discussed on
r.g.go  where a legal move was to pass and store up the move for
later use.  If you have 3 moves stored up then on your turn you can
make up to 4 moves in a row (all of which must be legal ... 2 eyes
is still enough).  How large must the board be before passing is the
correct first move?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Passing is always optimal, unless playing in the center is the best
first move.  The reason is that, whatever first move you would otherwise
make, you can just wait to see what your opponent does, and then make
the same first move, followed by your normal second move.  By symmetry,
you can't be denied the opportunity to make whatever your first move
would otherwise have been.
