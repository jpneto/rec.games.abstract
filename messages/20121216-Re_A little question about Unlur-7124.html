Hi, Cameron,

Thanks for your answer. There are three similar rule sets to consider here:

a) Black wins by forming a Y. White wins by preventing Black from doing so. This was my original suggestion. This is not equivalent to Unlur, since White can prevent Black from forming a Y by forming a Y himself, which is then a win for him.

b) Black wins by forming a Y. White wins by forming a line. This is a draw susceptible rule: by forming a Y, White prevents Black from winning but doesn't guarantee a win for himself, since Black can still prevent him from forming a line.

c) Black wins when either player forms a Y. White wins when either player forms a line. This is the Unlur rule.

I agree that the indirect White goal in my suggestion is slightly less clear to new players than the Unlur goal, but this is balanced out by the property that your stones can never harm you and the fact that it's a more compact goal, as you point out.

Then again, the cold aspect of some Unlur positions can also be seen as an extra level of indirection, but a positive one. The critical point in the game is the color choosing at the end of the contract phase, and knowing that your stones can harm you adds to the subtlety involved in that decision.

Finally, I have two questions:

a) Are cold wars (not coldness in general, of course) possible in Unlur? After some testing I'm almost convinced that they aren't, but you probably have a definitive answer.

b) I'm not sure what you mean by "the result is the same in each case", since you know my suggestion is not equivalent to Unlur. Could you clarify?

Regards,

Luis
