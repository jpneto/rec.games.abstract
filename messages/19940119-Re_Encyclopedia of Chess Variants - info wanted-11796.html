I strongly suspect that the game shown on Star Trek didn't have any rules
(i.e. the actors just moved the pieces around and pretended that they knew
what they were doing).  Somebody did come up with a game that was more or
less consistent with the glimpses shown on the TV series, and I presume
that's the ruleset that you have.

Of the many 3D chess variants I've seen, I think that was one of the worst.


Earlier, somebody posted to r.g.a about a program that was able to analyze
chess-like games and deduce the relative piece-values.  I didn't get a chance
to followup before the article expired, so I don't remember who wrote it,
but if you're still here, I'm curious about what the program would say about
my favorite 3D variant.

The board is 5x5x5.  A rook moves parallel to any of the three coordinate
axes (and hence changes one coordinate at a time); a bishop moves parallel to
the face diagonals (changing two coordinates at a time); a unicorn moves
parallel to the cube diagonals (changing three coordinates at a time).  The
queen has the combined powers of rook, bishop, and unicorn; the king likewise
but limited to a single step (to any of the (at most) 26 adjacent cells).
The knight can move to any of the cells whose offset is some permutation of
(0,1,2); i.e. a standard knight's move, but in any coordinate plane.  The pawn
can make one rookwise step in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the two directions that constitute
progress toward the promotion rank (5 cells on the remote edge of the board),
and captures by making one bishopwise step in any of five directions (four of
which are one progress-step and one sideways-step, and one of which is
progress in two directions at once).

Some observations: bishops are still polarized (they can only reach half of
the available cells).  However, a bishop has twice the mobility of a rook (six
lines of motion compared to the rook's three), and this seems to compensate: I
think the bishop is worth more than the rook.  Moreover, the knight's main
weakness in standard chess -- its limited range -- is offset by the small
diameter of the board (a knight in the center controls cells on all six faces
of the cube), and I've found it to also be more powerful than a rook.

Unicorns are nearly worthless.  Although it's not obvious from the board
coloration, they're even more polarized than bishops: they can only reach 1/4
of the cells on the board.  Good for a surprise move ("Hey!  I just noticed
that I can take your queen!"), but not very useful if the players can actually
visualize the board.

I'd be interested in seeing whether the program agrees with me, assuming it
can handle 3D boards.
