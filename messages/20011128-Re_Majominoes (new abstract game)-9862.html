I suspect the double move will actually allow O to win on all boards
for N&gt;=3, essentially by using it in her first move and hence turning
it into a game similar to the one in question 1 with her as first
player (and, hence, a winner in a perfect game). I can't quite factor
the two initial plays out of the proof, though, so I may be wrong.

I don't understand why the first two moves should be a problem.
After X has made the first move, O can choose whether to play
in the same region or a different region, which is even better
than playing first and having X choose between the two.

In move 3, O then plays as if she had started, as you say, and
must have a winning strategy.
