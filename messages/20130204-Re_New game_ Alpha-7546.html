I interpreted "black" as Player 1, or "who was initially black", which is what I think Christian meant since that would make sense.  I'll leave it to Christian to clarify though.

Connection games are inherently similar because they share the constraint of forming connecting paths between border segments.  Hex variants in particular have an even number of alternately colored border segments.  Small differences in connection games are significant given the tight constraints.

Much different is the vast ocean of all abstract games, in which you've moored your greedy boat to Nick's tiny spec of an island.  Again with you in mind as the primary, integrity challenged instigator, Luis, I'm calling for group boundaries on the "I call its" based on minor variations of other inventors' games.
