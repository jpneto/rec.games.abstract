I prefer a relatively analysable, but essentially random
game.  One of my favorite board games is Settlers of Catan.
The rules are simple and elegant, which makes it very
amenable to analysis.  However, the random element keeps
things casual enough that you can't (and thus don't have to)
look many turns in advance.

What about the difference between tactics and strategy (which
I haven't seen in this thread). Siedler wouldn't be my first
choice as an example, but I'll play the hand I've been dealt.
In addition to the tactical possibilities (which have, as you
say, a limited horizon) there are also strategic considerations.
Some are obvious (I'm on ore and wheat, I'll build cities.)
some less obvious (I must play to expand into that part of the
board) and some could be the source of much debate (if the board
is, say, poor in brick production how does that affect my overall
plans). OK, Siedler has limits on its strategy also (but what
it's got probably helps makes the game what it is) and I really
need a better example.

Best suggestion of a game where decision tree width, which may
have been expanded by randomness, is such as to make tactical
analysis of the game (down decision tree) of limited value but you
can play largely using strategic principles plus the limited
tactics you have?
