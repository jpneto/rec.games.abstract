Hello


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A few years ago I wrote a simple and stupid Teeko-program. It seems to
be a pretty  drawish game That was  without the tournament rule with
larger squares btw. Scarne apparently could beat all his tournament
opponents, but how trained were they? I don't know, but I'm guessing
it might be too drawish to stay interesting for serious players.

The tournament game has several additional rules which makes it rather
difficult to draw. The Fairview Teeko Club had many serious players and
draws were very rare among them. Your Teeko program doesn't proof
anything because it doesn't use the correct rules for serious play.

Compare with Dao on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.playdao.com">http://www.playdao.com</a>   This game is
related to Teeko, and it seems like "everybody loves it",
and they've had tournaments in it, but it is even more
drawish.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's true, but Dao has rather simple rules compared to advanced
Teeko.
