New MSG game: Riptide
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Riptide_rules.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Riptide_rules.html</a>

I hybridized a finite game with an infinite game, resulting in an
extraordinarily large finite game.  Only the top one or two checkers
of a stack are lifted off and moved - very ergonomic.  If Player 2
were to successfully mirror Player 1, Player 1 would win.  So there's
no incentive for Player 2 to mirror, and Player 1 doesn't have to be
on the lookout for mirroring or engage in countermirroring measures.
Nice.  My usual design constraints were relaxed in favor of
constructing a really big game tree.

I've tested this game for roughly about 20 hours over the past week or
so.  I did find one error, which I fixed.  If it's still flawed, fuck
me. I'll issue a full refund.  If I had to be 100% sure about every
game I released, I'd never release any games.
