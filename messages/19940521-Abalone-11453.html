Hello,

I have been an Abalone fan for quite a while, and my interest in the game has
recently been renewed by finding a computer version (ftp.uni-regensburg.de
in the /freeware/software/windows/games/denk (or something similar) directory).
I have, however, one serious compl[aint about the game - namely that I believe
that the game is essentially a draw.

I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that the only way to win the game is to
wait for your opponent to make a mistake.  Certainly, you can try to set traps
for him, to try to lure him into a bad position.  However, it seems that the 
advantage is alwaus with the defender.  It is impossible to force the other 
player into anything.  

I belive that it is possible, and in fact quite easy, to write a computer 
opponent which would never loose.  (Of course, it would probably also never 
win, but that is beside the point of my argument)  All the computer would have
to do is to set up a "secure" position and to maintain it.  If the computer 
refused to advance on any "openings" that the player might allow, it should be 
almost impossible to swindle the program into a trap.

Now, I have not done any kind of extensive analysis of the game.  These are 
just my impressions, and I would certainly love to see any kind of work done
(either in defense of, or opposition to, my assertion) on the subject.  
However, the purpose of this article is to propose a possible "solution" to 
this problem.  I have been considering a number of different rules modifi-
cations that would avoid this kind of stalemate.  Here is the oe which I would
like to propose:

	Whenever a player has a row of three marbles which is able to push
	a single marble of his opponents, his must push it.  The player has
	the option, however, of pushing with all three of his marbles, or
	just two of them.

Note that this rule would only appy to a 3-1 confrontation: it says nothing
about 3-2 or 2-1 positions.

Certainly this rule modification was partially inspired by the "must capture
rule" in draughts.

I would appreciate any comments people might have on this suggestion.  Needless
to say, I would lovc to have people try playing with this rule and tell me
how it works out.  I will not be able to test it myself until I finish my own
computer program (its not easy finding other human players).
