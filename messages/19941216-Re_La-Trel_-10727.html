Rules for La-Trel 
 
This is from the Encyclopedia of Chess Variants. I've never played the game. 
 
 
Here is the board: 
 
s s t w w t s s   &lt;-- Black Attackers 
d d b d d b d d   &lt;-- Black Defenders 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - 
D D B D D B D D   &lt;-- White Defenders 
S S T W W T S S   &lt;-- White Attackers 
 
The pieces are: 
 
Attackers: 
  T = Trident   Moves like a bishop in chess     Shaped like a rhombus 
  W = Warrior   Moves like a queen in chess      Shaped like a circle 
  S = Sabre     Moves like a rook in chess       Shaped like a large square 
 
Defenders: 
  D = Defender  Moves one square orthoganally    Shaped like small square 
  B = Blocker   Moves up to 3 squares any        Shaped like a hexagon 
                direction except sideways and 
                can change direction(s) during 
                a move 
 
(I realize the description of the movement of the blocker is ambiguous. 
 I really can't guess what moves might be allowed.) 
 
Attackers capture by occupying vacant square immediately beyond victim. 
Defenders (D or B) cannot capture. Blockers cannot be captured. Defenders 
promote to attackers. (I assume that means the 'D' pieces, not the blockers.  
I also assume that promotion is on the last rank and can be to any attacker 
you choose. Of course, that would always be a warrior.)  
 
Object is to eliminate the opponent's attackers. 
 
A simpler version does not use blockers -- 2nd row is D D D D D D D D. 
Multiple captures as in checkers is allowed. 
 
Edward
