I didn't catch the whole arguement, as it was really wearing me down
to read what was essentually mindless bickering, but i'd like to put
my haypenny in the idea pot anyways.
so i'm propsoing the following axioms i think people can agree on.

Axiom A:  The purpose of this game contest is to create new and
interesting games for people to learn and play.
Axiom B:  The ultimate goal of each game in the contest is to build
and maintain a strong player base

Thus based on this i propose the following to theory

Theory:  A game winning the contest through the means decided on may
not reflect the true winner of the contest judged by the long term
axioms proposed above.  This remains true no matter how the contest is
judged.
Corollary:  Thus the prize a game gets by winning the contest is an
added allure to try the game out, and added demand for the game to be
added to game sites

Now based on this i submit the following proposed hypothesis and
conclusions

Hypothesis:  Open voting will draw more attention to the games in the
contest, and thus produce a larger degree of player intrest in all the
games, including the winner.

Conclusion:  Since the goal of the contest is to make new and
interesting games, the best course of action is to do what is best for
the games, and what is best for the games is to do whatever draws the
most interest.  Also, since the winner of the contest may not be the
true winner, doing what is best for the whole set of games is probably
more important than who ultimately wins.  Thus, i think we should do
whatever draws the most attention to the contest, which is open
voting.  This will bring in more players, and a higher degree of
interest.  Also, the winner of a closed vote will not likely even
benefit from winning as not many people will care if they didn't even
get to help decide, where as the winner of an open vote will bring
many players to try it (in addition to them trying all the games to
make a decision).  Thus i think open voting is the only good way to
run the contest.

Personal note:  i played 10+ games of each game in the contest because
i was excited for the contest, if you close voting however, it makes
all that seem like a waste if i can't help decide who wins, and i
don't doubt there are others who learned and got enthusiastic about
the contest as a whole or one of the contest who feels the same way.

Post Script:  I read earlier that someone was potentially just going
to downvote MQ and grabber, i do not know why, but i'd like to point
out:
A:  MQ has already been implimented at both iggc and ms.nl, and
grabber has been implimented at ms.nl, and thus neither have as much
on the line as the other games, they will still have a chance to prove
their continued interest after the contest is over regardless if they
win or lose.
B:  Since winning the contest is not suppost to be the desired end for
a game, if someone spends hours making extra profiles just to down
vote a game that is going to have a continued player base anyways,
doesn't that just mean he wasted hours for virtually no effect?

Mindful of the fact that a procedure now has been estabished and is in
effect, I agree with most everything you say, for future contests.
'Personal popularity' shouldn't even be an issue.

Concerning Grabber, it's just a combinatorial quicky and it will
remain part of my oeuvre regardless of the contest. I really don't
care whether it wins or not. Most likely not, I'd say.
The pleasant thing for me was that the whole contest concept triggered
a number of nice games (that already started with the RGC contest from
which I withdrew). Creativity triggered by a contest was a new and
somewhat surprising experience for me, and I'm all for repeating it on
a yearly basis.
