Has anyone seen any rules for the 3D chess game on the original ST series? 
(I am NOT interested in buying the Franklin Mint version of this game.)

I remember reading the rules many years ago (10+) and coming to the
conclusion that the game was basically unplayable.  The chess set was
first made as a prop and then somone tried to make the game work.

There is a beautiful 3d chess set on the market called "hyper-chess" or
something like that.  The board design and rules were very carefully
thought out.  Very playable.  The only thing that keeps me from buying
it is the $175.00 price tag.
