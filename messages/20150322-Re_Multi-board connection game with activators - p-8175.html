Proposed new rules for pAth

pAth, a 4D connection game, with activators:
Each side has 16 "connectors" and 2 activators
The board is a 4x4 array of 4x4 "tiles", totaling 256 squares and 16 tiles.
Connectors move on squares, activators move on tiles.
Connectors move as ROOKS, always in a straight line, stepping 1 - 3 squares orthogonally. They may move back and forth or side to side within one 4x4 tile, or they may move back and forth or side to side from tile to tile, always landing on the corresponding square in each tile moved into. 
Connectors may not move on top of or through any other connector. 
Activators are placed on the central intersection in a tile, not within a little square, one to a tile.
Activators may leap to any of the 16 tiles.
No piece may be in the same location as another piece - one connector per square, one activator per tile.
A connector may only move within, to, or from a tile with an activator.
A connector connects to the (up to) 4 squares in the 4x4 tile it's in, and connects to the (up to) 4 corresponding little squares in the neighboring tiles.
Therefore, the shortest path across the board is 7 squares.
There is no capture, but put-backs of opponent's pieces are allowed.

To start, each player's 16 connectors are placed in the back/closest row of squares in the tiles closest to that player, forming a 16 unit line across the board. 
One activator is placed in the back left tile (with 4 of the connectors), and the other is placed 2 tiles right, giving the 4 activators a staggered set-up.

Turn 1: White moves 1 white piece according to the above movement rules; black moves 2 black pieces according to the above movement rules.

Turn 2: White moves 3 white pieces; black moves 3 black pieces.

Turn 3 on: White moves 4 white pieces, or moves 3 white pieces and puts 1 black piece back to black's back row. This put-back may come as any of the 4 white moves. Black then moves 4 black pieces or 3 black pieces, and puts one white piece back in white's back row. 

A put-back is done by removing an opponent's connector from where it is and placing it in any empty square of the opponent's back row; or by removing an opponent's activator from a tile and placing it in any empty tile of the 4 "back row" tiles for that player. 

Win by being first to have a complete connection from your back row to the opponent's back row.

Enjoy!

Can anybody tell me why the unchanged lines from elsewhere are in gray type above? Anyhow, here's an explanation of the concept of path in pAth:

Okay, consider each tile. It is a 4x4 array of squares, so the shortest path across that tile is 4 squares.
[X][X][X][X]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]
***********************
Now consider 4 tiles - only 1 row shown.
[X][X][X][X] | [0][0][0][X] | [0][0][0][X] | [0][0][0][X]

7 steps take you across board, with the connectors all 1 orthogonal step apart.
**********************
[X][X][0][0] | [0][X][X][0] | [0][0][X][X] | [0][0][0][X]
This is another path.
Does it make sense now?

The full board is the same as the Hyperchess4 board:
