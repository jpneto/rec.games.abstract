Hello folks of the world!

This new game is not very original, indeed it is hardly so
at all.  Most here will be somewhat familiar with the game Arak,
originally constructed to be a 1-dimensional equivalent of Go.
It didn't turn out to be all that similar to Go, but was a good
game anyway, with the strange feature that it is almost all tactics,
with no sniff of strategic structure or planning at all.

The new game is merely the same thing wrapped into a circle,
to "cleanse" the game of its special-case features of end points;
for the game purist.  The other features are all the same -
one may play into liberty-less positions without suicide,
pseudo-ko is rife, game emds when someone has no move.

The name, (really the only new thing here), comes from
some sort of contraction of Arak-ring, reduced to Alaric,
which is a good name for a game anyway, especially one with
random, chatoic, (barbaric) features, as it seems to have.

ALARIC
======
Played on a circle of n cells, n chosen in advance.

In alternating turns, players play (if possible) a single stone
of their own colour on any non-forbidden empty point of the board.

If by so doing, any lines of (one or more) adjacent opponent's
stones becomes bounded at both ends by the player's own stones,
those opponent stones are removed from the board.  The cells thus
vacated may not be played in by the opponent on his next move,
(though either player may play in them later on).

The game ends when either player cannot make a legal move;
at which time the player with the most stones on the board wins.

A CHALLENGE:

I have calculated that when

n = 1 ;  1st-player wins.
n = 2 ;  2nd-player wins.
n = 3 ;  1st-player wins.
n = 4 ;  2nd-player wins. (by correct play - 1st non-automatic case)
n = 5 ;  1st-player wins.                   (1st nontrivial case)
n = 6 ;  2nd-player wins.                   (1st difficult case)
n = 7 ;  -- too hard for me already!

CHALLENGE to gamers - find the optimal play and result for n = 7;
and higher cases if possible.
