In his other group, Clark posts "I agree that we need as many members
as we can get. There are still
some hold-outs. Michael Howe for instance has a personal grudge
against me for calling him Steere's hand-puppet."  Personal grudge,
no; I simply don't have any confidence that given this kind of
behavior, he has anywhere near the maturity to "moderate" a forum.
Since then, by the way, he has done worse.  He also announces his
intent to continue to spam this group.  I doubt that all those who
have joined that group know about Clark's personality problems, as
exhibited here, at BGG, and at IGCC.  Maybe his ISP would be
interested in his history of spamming and harassment and his announced
intent to continue to do?  If Corey wants my participation in his
other group, he needs to start by apologizing for all of his insulting
posts and his spamming of this group, and to desist.
