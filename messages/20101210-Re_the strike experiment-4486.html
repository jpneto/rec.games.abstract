Christian Freeling is hurling mud in a completely unjustified manner,
this time by making use of technical medical terms he is just
unqualified to make. Ignore it, and pity him for stooping so low. For
all his apparent skill at inventing games, to do this in the midst of
trying to answer an open and question (posed by yourself) merely
devalues his contributions.

For the record, Bill Taylor is also interested in abstract games.

Thanks for your analysis Bu Zhidao xian sheng.
You may be interested in the fact that I never used profanities such
as the ones by Bill that I reluctantly reproduce below. I merely give
as my opinion that he is mediocrity claiming the spotlight. I never
got a serious answer on any games related question.
I made fun of him in "Turd", but only after the profanities he
published.

I'm sure he has redeeming qualities that make that you are upset if I
suggest "Tourette", which a laymen as myself might suggest in such a
case, because we're not living in China, yet you seem unaffected by
said profanities from the side of mr. Taylor.
That's an interesting point of view, though I cannot say I fully
understand it.

Well, that's pretty much the clearest sign that Stark Mere sees himself chiefly as Freeling's cocksucker.
He certainly likes to behave that way!
....
So no more complaining about Christian Freeling for me,
even if he consistently fails to live up to his....  first name.
Nothing I could possibly say could embarrass him more than Stark's horrible cocksucking.
