Thanks!  That looks very nice (except the only-runs-on-Linux part,
but I suppose that can hardly be helped, for such a graphics-intensive
application as board games).  I will definitely check it out.

I wouldn't consider board games "graphics-intensive"; certainly not in
the sense that the video game industry uses the term.

No; but the graphic and UI design is most of the raison d'etre for the
game, and it's what the programmer spends most of his time on [especially
if the search tree code is already supplied :) ].  Contrast to
I/O-intensive apps or algorithm-intensive apps.

gtkboard only intuitively supports rectangular boards.  You'd have
to do something like splitting the square cells into triangles and
conceptualizing the game that way.  OTOH, if you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> do that, I
bet you'd get a lot of props from the gtkboard devteam! :-)

I have downloaded the current build, and I'm currently working on
the gtkboard interface for Capture Pentominoes.  At the moment,
my idea is to store the state of the board internally as an
array of characters in the format I posted in the first message:

   .......
   ....N..
   ..wNN..
   .wwNL..
   ww.NL..
   ....L..
   ....LL.

where the lowercase letters represent the most recent move.  Then
checking for captures merely entails making a list of all the
84 edges on the board, and looking at the cells on either side of
each edge.

The hardest thing about gtkboard, I think, is that as far as I
can tell its interface is limited to "capture a click somewhere on
the board", which means it'll be a pain to select and place
irregular figures like pentominoes.  Maybe it needs a full
user interface, something like the following very bad ascii-art:

            --------------
  FILNPT   |              |
  UVWXYZ   |              |
  ------   |  the game    |
-|   =  |- |   board      |
&lt;| I=I  |&gt;||              |  ----
-| =    |- |              | | rm |
  ------   |              |  ----
            --------------

   To remove a piece:
     Click the piece to select it.
     Click "remove".
   To place a new piece:
     Click the letter corresponding to the piece.
     The piece will appear in the left-hand window.
     Click the left and right arrows to rotate the piece.
     Click one of the squares on the piece.
     Click an empty square on the board.
     The piece will be placed with the two squares coinciding.


That's a rather involved interface, and even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>more<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> involved
for the programmer!  I'm not sure how to get around this.
Ideas welcome.
