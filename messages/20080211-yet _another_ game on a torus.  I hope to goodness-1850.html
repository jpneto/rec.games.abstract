This one emerged from the thread about Mark Steere's game Torus.   I
shall call it Donut.

The rules:

Played on a standard rhombus shaped hex board.  Each player owns a
pair of edges and the stones of one color as in hex, and alternately
place them on board as in hex.

imagine the rhombus is a torus, so that opposite sides meet.

player 1 wins if a NS loop is formed in his color.
player 2 wins if an EW loop forms in his color.

If either player forms a helix (either R- or L-) with his stones, he
instantaneously wins.
