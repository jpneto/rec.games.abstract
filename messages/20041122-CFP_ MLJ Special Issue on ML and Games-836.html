<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope
<br>
<br>Authors are invited to submit full papers presenting original results on
<br>any aspect of machine learning and games.&nbsp; An ideal contribution to
<br>this special issue would be strongly motivated by applications to
<br>commercial or classical games and focused on research issues relevant
<br>to the topics described below.&nbsp; Papers specific to game theory,
<br>however, should be submitted to a forthcoming special issue.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background
<br>
<br>Games, whether created for entertainment, simulation, or education,
<br>provide great opportunities for machine learning.&nbsp; The variety of
<br>possible virtual worlds and the subsequent ML-relevant problems posed
<br>for the agents in those worlds is limited only by the imagination.
<br>Furthermore, not only is the games industry large and growing (having
<br>surpassed the movie industry in revenue a few years back), but it is
<br>faced with a tremendous demand for novelty that it struggles to
<br>provide.&nbsp; Against this backdrop, machine learning driven successes
<br>would draw high-profile attention to the field.&nbsp; Surprisingly however,
<br>the more commercial the game to date, the less impact learning has
<br>made.&nbsp; This is quite unlike other great matches between application
<br>and data-driven analytics such as data mining and OLAP.
<br>
<br>There is a broad and familiar spectrum of research relevant to games
<br>applications, ranging from inference in partially observable worlds to
<br>representational issues to faster and more robust methods for speech
<br>recognition.&nbsp; There are a few relatively new research thrusts as well.
<br>For example, online learning in which models are constructed and used
<br>on the fly from data unavailable until gameplay time, is a very rich
<br>source of new and interesting problems.&nbsp; Topics of particular
<br>importance for successful game applications include the generation of
<br>new practical and theoretical tools to help with:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * learning to play the game: game worlds provide excellent test beds
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for investigating the potential learning has to improve
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agents' capabilities. The enviroment can be constructed with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varying characteristics, from deterministic and discrete as in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classical board and card games to indeterministic and continuous as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in action computer games. Learning algorithms for such tasks have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been studied quite thoroughly, but recent improvements are of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interest for this special issue.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * learning about players: opponent modeling, partner modeling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; team modeling, and multiple team modeling are fascinating,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interdependent and largely unsolved challenges.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * model selection and stability: online settings lead to what is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effectively the unsupervised construction of models by supervised
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; algorithms.&nbsp; Methods for biasing the proposed model space without
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; significant loss of predictive power are critical not just for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning efficiency, but interpretive ability and end-user confidence.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * optimizing for adaptivity: building opponents that can just barely
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lose in interesting ways is just as important for the game world as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creating world-class opponents.&nbsp; This requires building highly
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adaptive models that can substantively personalize to adversaries
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or partners with a wide range of competence and rapid shifts in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play style.&nbsp; By introducing a very different set of update and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; optimization criteria for learners, a wealth of new research
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; targets are created.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * model interpretation: "what's my next move" is not the only query
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desired of models in a game, but it is certainly the one which gets
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most attention.&nbsp; Creating the illusion of intelligence requires
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "painting a picture" of an agent's thinking process.&nbsp; The ability
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to describe the current state of a model and the process of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inference in that model from decision to decision enables queries
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that provide the foundation for a host of social actions in a game
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such as predictions, contracts, counter-factual assertions, advice,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justification, negotiation, and demagoguery.&nbsp; These can have as
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much or more influence on outcomes as actual in-game actions.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; * performance: resource requirements for update and inference will
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always be of great importance.&nbsp; The AI does not get the bulk of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPU or memory, and the machines driving the market will always be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underpowered compared to typical desktops at any point in time.
<br>
<br>Each submission will be reviewed according to the standards of the
<br>Machine Learning Journal.
