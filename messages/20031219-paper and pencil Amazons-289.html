Inspired by Walter Joris's very interesting, if not consistently well-written
book on paper and pencil games, I tried a paper and pencil version of Amazons
today, solitaire style. It's the same as regular Amazons, except that the
square from which your Amazon moved automatically becomes an arrow square after
the Amazon moves away from it, but before it shoots its new arrow.  This means
that you can play it with X's and O's for the Amazons, and color in the arrow
squares, or use a superimposed X and O together for all arrow squares.  The
game is faster, since each move uses up two empty squares instead of one, and
tactics are different, since it becomes much harder to get back into a region
once you move out of it.  There's even a little more subtlety to figuring out
how many endgame moves a given territory will produce.  I'd like to encourage
others to try it and post their thoughts here.  I have some other ideas for
Amazons variants playable on paper and pencil, and I'll put the good ones up
here as I figure out what they are.
