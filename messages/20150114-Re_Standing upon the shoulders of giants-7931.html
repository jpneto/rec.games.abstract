I had never seen if BGG forum people trying to debate in detail some game except when the game is sent by someone who is a member of the "famiglia".
How MANY GAMES are uncommented in BGG?????????????
3 OR 4 TIMES the games commented!!!
Why?
It seems to me that people in the abstract game forum are in the forum not for helping others or even for learning but for STEALING what it could be STOLEN and that`s it!!!

It sometimes bothers me when a game goes uncommented, but on the other hand, I'm not always in the mood to comment on a new game either. Posters are often mislead by their initial impressions, if not indeed by their inability to tell a strategy game from a tactical one.

Not as long as I'm there, and I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the majority of posters either.

Depending on context, none of us is completely free of hypocrisy. Not even you. Deny it and prove my point. No extra exclamation marks required.
