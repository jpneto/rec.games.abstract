Thank you!

Mirroring is a problem with hexhex bords and odd-sized square boards.
Black can start with a white stone in the center and next mirror

Before I read any of the subsequent posts, this is the reply I got
ready when you mailed me on the matter:

"It occurs to me that the seed of asymmetry every Yodd/Xodd position
must have in the form of at least one odd group should be enough for
the losing player to prevent continuous mirroring play from his
opponent:

- Strategically, the losing player will try to use his extra group to
create a faster frame than the mirrored one from his opponent. When he
finally joins his groups, his opponent will still be one stone away
from doing so. In the scenario you suggest, And, from the point of
view of the non-mirroring player, there couldn't be a better cell for
the extra group to be placed than the center cell.

- Tactically, there are at least two kinds of moves which can't be
mirrored:

  a) Occupying one cell and its symmetrical complement on a single
turn, with stones of the same color.
  b) Playing next to the odd group, if it's in the center cell. If you
change parity by doing so, your opponent won't, and viceversa. This
way, the second move of the turn can't be mirrored.

This should be enough to discourage/break persistent mirroring play.
Let's see an example 3x3 Xodd game:

(coordinates as in chess; notation of moves is preceded by the Color
of the played stone)

1. Wb2, Wb1 Wc2;
2. Bb3 Ba2, Bc1;
3. Wa3, pass;
4. pass, and White wins with 2 groups to 3.

Or, even better:

1. Wb2, Wb1, Wb3;

and Black can't mirror."
