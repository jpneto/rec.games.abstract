In the special Nuremberg-edition (die Siedler von N�rnberg) this is
already done. Instead of dice it contains a deck of 36 cards which
tell you what hexes will produce. It contains of course one 2, two 3s,
three 4s, etc. Most of them have a special event on them, one of which
is �shuffle the deck�. It makes things fairer because you know that if
a number has not come up in some time, it has a larger chance of being
drawn.

To clarify, there is no "shuffle the deck", but there are three "time
passes" cards, on the two 11s and the 12 (I think). The game board has
a time track with "reshuffle deck" on the third and sixth spaces (the
ninth is "game over"). So one thing about Settlers of Nuremberg is
that you know that the 11 and 12 spaces will always produce during one
go-around of the deck, but other numbers might not.
