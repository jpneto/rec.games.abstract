Actually this means, regarding <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>moves<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, players can actually take any
disc on the board and move it, regardless of color. It can even be the
top of a stack. The receiver stacking mechanism can handle this, you
have to try it yourself. Wow?

ps. this was a lot of discussion on one single day ;)

You're not off the hook yet ;-)

"When a player builds a stack of height 5 (or larger), this stack is
removed from the board, the discs are put back to the reserve and the
player, who owned the top disc of that stack, scores 1 point."

I think you should remove the comma after 'player'. Gramatically it
now says that the player who build the stack also happens to own the
top disc.

As I understand it now this is not the case: I'm free to move a stack
with an opponent's color on top, say a '2' and move it 3 squares to a
receiver stack of height 3 and thus score a point for my opponent. So
"the player who owns the top disc" scores (no comma) regardless of who
performs the move.
The point being that few players would be inclined to do so, but it's
not actually forbidden.

Is that right?
