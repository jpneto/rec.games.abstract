The quote in context is as follows.

"Consider one difference in how Kasparov and Deep Thought/Deep Blue
play chess.  In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov
by sacrificing a piece. [current] Computer programs are not supposed
to be able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-
mordem analysis, Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed
all possible variations at least up to the point where the computer
regained the sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice
the piece for strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones."

You can replace the sentence

"[current] Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons."

A fine line. The evaluation function for determining the value
of a position during a minmax search usually includes strategic
considerations. In the case of chess this is a dead certainty,
if the computer is going to play with any strength at all. There
isn't enough time or space available to a current computer to
make move decisions on tactical analysis alone.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


Yes, the evaluation functions in computer chess programs make
use of strategic factors.  But current evaluation functions are
generally not refined enough for strategic factors to outweigh
material factors.  If they did, computer programs would throw
away pieces in unsound sacrifices; and losing a piece is in most
positions tantamount to losing the game.  It may be a fine line
but I think it exists.


In regards to the meaning of "not supposed to be able to make ...,"
I looked it up in the Oxford Dictionary.  The Oxford defines "supposed,"
when it is followed by "to" and combined with the infinitive form
of a verb ("to make"), as meaning "be expected."  Thus, according to
the Oxford Dictionary, the sentence means "[current] Computers are not
expected to be able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons," and that
covers my intended meaning rather precisely (of course you don't expect
a current computer program to be capable of doing X if it didn't do
X in all previous instances).
