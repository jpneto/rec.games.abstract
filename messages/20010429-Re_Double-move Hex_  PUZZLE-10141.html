I had written the excerpt below.  Now I'd like to present the end-position
of an interesting game of Double-move Hex (doublet forbidden) where white
(o) started in the center (E5) but LOST.

   I . . . . . . . . x         o is Horizontal
    H . . . . . . o . .        x is Vertical
     G . . . . o . . x o       x to double-move and win
      F . . . . . x . . .      (doublet forbidden)
       E . . . . o . x o x
        D . . o . x . o . .    If I'm wrong, well I'm new to this game too!
         C . . . o o . . x .
          B . x . . . x . o .
           A . . . x . o . . .
              1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

I'm thinking of calling this game "Hexx" if the name is still available...

Has anyone tried "double-move" Hex where the two stones placed cannot
be adjacent?  (A player may choose to forego the second stone because
of this constraint.)  Of course, the goal of such a variant would be
to neutralize the first mover advantage.  Any comments appreciated,

Yes, "double-move" seems to be a good way to neutralize the first
player advantage. But what is the reason for your rule against placing
two adjacent stones?

I played some games from micro to larger boards, and here are two reasons:

(1) The "doublet" move, if not disallowed, breaks the basic "bridge"
structure of Hex (which I call the "stride" in my games) while I was
trying to preserve the flavor of Hex.  Interestingly, mobility/extension
becomes greater (the "jump" is connected) and simple extension by
doublets is too hard to stop -- leading to a futile doublet-ridden
defense of doublet attack.  DOUBLET ALLOWED:

     x   The stride        . .   But the
    . .  is not a         x . x  jump is a
     x   connection.       . .   connection!

(2) Disallowing the doublet introduces ko (or enhances? I have always
thought Hex ko-ish but can't explain it).  The game is still Hex but
"more so".  DOUBLET DISALLOWED:

   o a . .   White (o) to defend but    . x o     White (o) to attack and
    x b a    cannot play doublet so      a b o    plays a; black defends
     x o .   plays a; black plays b       x . o   with b and tries to
             and somewhere else.           a x .  attack somewhere else.

I considered disallowing even the bridge (stride) in a double-move but
tight positions became nearly unplayable, and defense suffered.  Possibly,
one might disallow an open bridge ("2-connected") while allowing a
(partially) blocked one.

Hex is a paradoxical game -- offense being too strong leads to defensive
strategies...

Aside: double-move variants typically are slugfests; witness Abalone which
is a stalemate under standard rules but FUN under double-move.

I recommend playing doublet-free, double-move Hex on a larger board than
usual.
