I would like to know what people think of this game (i.e. is it interesting?)
and also what, if any, similarities it has to the game Darwin.

Play starts with two opposing 'robots' each occupying one 'position' out of a 
certain number of possible positions which they could be in. They are not 
aware of the other robot's starting position.

On each round, all robots make one move. A move consists of either spawning a 
new robot on a specified location, or attacking a specified location, or doing
nothing. If a location is attacked by more than one robot, then it is empty
on the next round. If a robot attempts to spawn a new robot, then it is 
successful only if the space it attempts to spawn to is empty and that 
location isn't being attacked by more than one robot. The winning side is the 
one which has the most robots after a set number of rounds.

A robot may be passed parameters by the robot which creates it. After that,
it can't communicate with any other robot. There is no way for a robot to tell
whether a given position is occupied.

The whole point of the game is that each robot is completely blind - there's
absolutely no way that it can know anything except that it hasn't been killed
yet.

Does anybody have any comments, suggestions, etc?
