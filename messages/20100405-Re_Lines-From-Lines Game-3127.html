Actually, there is even an easier way for the first player to lose, if
that is what he wants to do.
Just connect two vertices on your first move such that the line does
not intersect any intermediate vertices. Connecting two adjacent
vertices will do. You'll lose before the second player even moves.

As far as losing by playing the symmetric moves after first bisecting
the grid with a line, I don't think that will necessarily work either.
Remember that no lines can be drawn from any vertices that already
have lines terminating there. So, reflective symmetry about the first
(main diagonal) line won't work if the second player draws lines from
that first line. Rotational symmetry won't work if there are an odd
number of dots, and the second player draws from the center dot, which
is on the first line.

Still, the goal is to WIN, not to lose.  :)

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

It's something you may have already considered,
but there's an easy strategy to always lose as
first player, and perhaps it can be adapted to
a strategy for winning.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As first player to lose, one draws a diagonal
line from one corner of the grid to another,
so thereafter any moves must take place solely
on one side or the other of this diagonal, and
the first player can adopt a mirror strategy:
whatever move the second player makes, first
player makes on the opposite diagonal side.
Thus the first player moves last and loses!

Can this be adapted to a winning strategy?
I'm not sure if it can, or that adapting it
can be considered "easy".  A move requires
an end-point that has not previously been
touched by a line, and these are fairly easy
to keep track of.  However, although each
move eliminates one such end-point from
future consideration, grid points may also
be "dead" despite being untouched because
they became isolated by surrounding line
segments from all possible start-points.

Okay.  I thought that a grid point could
be used as a starting point more than once.
You seemed to be allowing two moves to start
(but not to end) at the same grid point when
you wrote:

It might perhaps better be phrased:

: no line starts/ends at or crosses another
: line's start- or end-point (whether or not
: yet another line passes completely through
: that vertex)
