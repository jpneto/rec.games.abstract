***Soon to be Published: Update of POLYOMINOES by Solomon Golomb***

Solomon Golomb's update of his book POLYOMINOES, which has been out of
print for quite a while, was due out July 1994, though as of this writing,
I still haven't found a copy. If you are not in the know, a polyomino is a
generalized domino. Just as a domino is formed by two edge joined squares,
a tromino has three squares, etc, and polyomino would include all forms.
Probably the popular group of polyominoes are the pentominoes -- the 12
distinct shapes that can be formed by combining 5 squares edge to edge
(ignoring rotations and reflections). The first edition of the book had
hundreds of constructions and puzzles, both solved and unsolved, along with
a few games.

________________________________________________________

These are the 12 pentominoes and the letter of the alphabet they are
commonly referred to by. They are the only 12 shapes possible by combining
5 squares along the edges. They are easy to remember -- FILiPiNo TUVWXYZ.

In honor of the book's return, I'd like to suggest playing <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Golomb's Game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
by email. It's an ideal game for email, as the games are very short ... the
longest possible game (though unlikely) is only 12 turns long. As far as I
know, the game has still not solved.

The original version of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Golomb's Game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>:

--The playing pieces are the twelve pentominoes.

--The board is an 8x8 grid whose squares are the same size as the
pentoninoes' squares.

--Players take turns placing a piece on the board. Pents must be placed in
alignment with the squares of the board

--Last player to place a pent wins.

I do not know if the misre version is as interesting or whether or not it
has been solved.

To play <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Golomb's Game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by email, we would send an 8x8 grid back and forth,
adding our pent each time. Here's an example game (with no particular
playing skill demonstrated):

After 1st move:   After 2nd move:   After 3rd move:   After 4th move:
- - - - - - - -   - - - - - - - -   - - V - - - - -   - - V - - - - -

 F--P-TU-WX-Z      F--P-T--WX-Z      F--P-T--WX-Z

Game over -- first player wins.


There is another version called <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Chose-up Pentominoes<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. I do not know who
invented it. One small rule change makes it an entirely different game. I
think it's much more fun.

--Same playing pieces and board.

--Players take turns choosing pentominoes until they have 6 each.

--Now the player's take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board.

--Last person to play wins.
(Once one player can no longer play, the other player plays as many pieces
as possible. The player who places the most pieces in a series of games
wins.)

--Typically, after one round, players swap pieces so they each get a crack
at the same situation. In this case, one player can split up the pieces
before the game starts, and the other player picks which set to play with
first and who plays first.

In this game, players try to stake out 'sanctuaries' that only their
pieces fit in, while preventing their opponent from doing the same.
