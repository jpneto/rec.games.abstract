What's neither perfect information nor hidden information?  Obscured
information, the villain of the trio.  It's neither here nor there.  In
Lasca for example, you have a stacking game in which the faces of the pieces
are obscured in the stack, so you don't know what they are, unless you
remember.

In Mancala games with large numbers of stones in the pits, the stone count
is obscured.  Decorum prohibits scooping out a pit and counting the stones,
so you just guess.  Most traditional Mancala games are primitive and
imprecise both in the estimation of stone count and in the actual
rapid-fire, error strewn placement of the stones.

Traditionally, Mancala stones are of one, uniform color and the physical
manipulation is a one handed, fluid scoop-and-distribute action.  Modern
"Mancala" games sometimes employ various stone types and colors, abandoning
the one handed, fluid scoop-and-distribute action for a two handed,
non-fluid, scoop-sort-pick-and-distribute action.

Just for reference, here's a lovely example of a modern Mancala game which
is finite, perfect information (due to a limit of an easily countable five
stones or less per pit)... and which celebrates the true spirit of Mancala -
with a one handed scoop-and-distribute of a single color of stones.

My post to bgg on October 20, 2009:

Kauri is a game of hidden information.

Kauri has a clever, foundational mechanism that
creates naturally finite gameplay. My
compliments to Ralf Gering for that. Tragically
though he tacked on an awful "tie-breaker" rule
set that does nothing of the sort. It merely
introduces the potential for endless move cycles,
ruining the simplicity and finitude of an
otherwise inventive design.

Ralf Gering's response on December 22, 2010:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
[Kauri] has neither "hidden information"...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ralf, if the few kauri stones are hidden under piles of the much more
numerous non-kauri stones, they're obscured - not hidden like cards in a
Poker hand, but hidden to the extent that you can't see them.  You need to
swirl the stones around in the pits with your fingers to see where they are.
 That's what I call obscured.

nor are endless move cycles possible.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, Ralf, endless move cycles <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> possible in at least one form of Kauri
you released. A quote from your Kauri rule sheet:

"If both players have captured the same number [of stones, creating a tie
outcome], the game continues until one player can't move. His adversary is
then declared the winner of the game."

HERE'S THE PROBLEM, RALF.  YOUR STATEMENT IS FALLACIOUS.  THE GAME WOULD
NEVER HAVE TO REACH A POINT WHERE "ONE PLAYER CAN'T MOVE".  PLAYERS COULD
SIMPLY CHASE EACH OTHER AROUND THE BOARD INDEFINITELY.

Ralf, learn how to accept a compliment without trying to milk it to death.

Ad hominem may be a very effective tool at bgg, Ralf, but it doesn't fly
here at rec.games.abstract.
