I am interested in finding more information about any of the old African games
which fit under the umbrella name Mankala. Some local names are Bao, Omweso
Mweso, but there are many more. 

Typically, these games are played on a wooden/stone/sand board of either
two or four rows of hollows or cups. There can be between 6 and 12 cups
per row. Each player has a number of counters/seeds (typically 32 seeds each).
The aim is simply to capture the opponents counters. Moves are made by
removing all the seeds from one cup and "sowing" them round the board one
at a time. Where the last seeds falls determines whether a capture is made,
whether the player can continue a move, or whether the move terminates, but the
precise conditions of capture etc differ widely between the variations.

The games are thought to have originated on the East coast of Africa, but
variations have spread far afield. Arab traders in particular have spread
the game eastwards to the Pacfic and are thought to have developed the
four row versions which were reintroduced into East Africa. I also know
that at least one modern American games manufacturer has distributed a
version.

I would be interested to hear from anyone who plays any of these games, 
or knows where the rules to any of the variations have been published.

If you don't know any of these games, I would encourage you to give them
a try. Their deceptively simple design hides a game of complex strategy.
I would say they are less complicated than chess and its variations, but
probably more complicated than draughts.

The two row games are probably easiest to learn at first. However, since
I have the article to hand, I will post the rules to the 4 row game of
Mweso in the following article.
