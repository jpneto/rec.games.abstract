Well, since you mentioned Kaliko, ever heard of its precursor:
"Psyche-Paths" (gack) Small wonder it bombed out. It came out in 1969
from Funtastic. 85 cardboard hexagon tiles, 3 path colors, lousy
production quality- the paths rarely match up smoothly.

But if you're interested in GOOD games, how about The Sigma File,
invented by Dr. Eric Solomon? I've never seen the game, but I read about
it in a book of classic abstract games. It's basically a 4-person
boardgame with an international espionage setting. The object is to
use the agents to maneuver the Sigma File document into your home city.
One interesting twist is, you're rarely sure which agents are under your
control, and which will turn on you. Bluffing is a major element.

Then there's Ploy, by Fred Thibault, listed in that same book, whatever
its title &amp; author may be. It's essentially a chess variant, with round
pieces with arrows that may either be moved in a direction they're pointing, or
turned to point in a new direction.

And there's Jungle, which may be popular in the Far East. Also chesslike,
it's similar to Stratego with a hierarchy of capturing capability, but
there are fewer pieces and no hidden information. This is the only game of
all I've mentioned that I've played more than once. It's got some interesting
tactical motifs that are not immediately apparent (to me, anyway.)
