My brother got CONNECTIONS for Christmas.  I haven't played Twixt, so
  I can't compare them.

The game consists of two players taking alternating turns of placing on
  a grid a tile with their color (red or white) and a line.

There are no ties -- one player will always win.  Games take two to
  five minutes or so.  Each player has 27 pieces.

There are two ways to win.  One is to make some kind of line connecting
  one side of the board to the opposite.  The other is to form an unbroken
  line surrounding one or more of your opponent's pieces.

The small problem with this game is that there are few strategies.  The
  rules mention that there are 51,000 variations, which means that many
  games are too similar.

The big problem with this game is that the player who moves first has a
  huge advantage.  My father and my two brothers and I were fascinated
  with trying to prove this advantage.  After learning the rules and
  playing a couple of games, it was rare for the first player to lose;
  we called these "upsets."  Since the games are so short, we played a
  lot.  In the course of 100 games or so, the first player to move won
  about 90% of the time in my estimation.

If you are interested in a game of this nature, by all means buy it.  I
  must say we did spend a lot of time with it at first.  But I doubt
  if any of us would play it again.  If you want a game with longevity,
  look elsewhere.  If you find it on sale very cheap, it would make
  an interesting case study of why a game doesn't work.
