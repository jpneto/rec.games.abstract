	Well, it certainly wouldn't improve the game.  But both
that change and a change to 0.1 would, it seems to me, make far
less difference than you seem to think.

  *  No difference at all to matches, where only wins matter, inc
	especially WC matches, which is where many of the complaints
	have come.
  *  No difference at all to league chess [perhaps 60-70% of all
	serious chess in the UK], where only wins affect the match
	result.
  *  No difference at all to "friendly" chess in your club.
  *  No difference at all to KO tournaments.
  *  Negligible difference to "weekend" tournaments, where you have
	to be very lucky to win a 5-round event with 4/5.  Four wins
	and a draw will put you ahead of everyone with either one loss
	or two draws, whether the draw scores 0.1 or 0.9.
  *  Negligible difference to 5-min or rapidplay or correspondence
	tournaments, where "soft" draws are already very rare.
  *  So you are left with long Swiss tournaments and round-robins.
	These may be an important part of top GM chess, but it's a
	tiny proportion of chess as played by the rest of us.
  *  Even then, while there certainly are abuses [which can be stopped
	by other means -- Rentero simply didn't invite players who
	took short draws back to Linares], you seem to be assuming
	that a large proportion of draws are abusive, and would stop
	if draws scored &lt; 0.5.  It would plainly have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> effect;
	but it seems to me like an unnecessary sledgehammer to crack
	the wrong and rather small nut.  A long tournament simply is
	a very arduous event -- it's like taking 11 or 14 6-hr exams
	on consecutive days, with any single lapse of concentration
	potentially scoring you zero on that paper.  If you deny the
	players ways of taking some days off, they will simply find
	other ways.
