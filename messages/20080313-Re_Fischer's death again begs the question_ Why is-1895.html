<br>I think it would be in principle no more difficult for a soccer team to pull
<br>this off without suspicion than it would be for chess players. Of course,
<br>it would be difficult for both.
<br>
<br>The point is that the current scoring system produces collusion
<br>in chess that nobody disputes. It <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> part of chess' tradition to
<br>have unplayed draws. While I might grant that people should be on the
<br>look out for these far-fetched theoretical possibilities that Mr.
<br>Richerby raises, they should not be considered as serious
<br>objections absent <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> supporting evidence.

<br><blockquote type=cite>That strategy, though illegal and contrary to the tradition of the sport,

<br>West Germany v Austria, 1982 World Cup, is (an example of) another problem
<br>with your argument that this sort of thing does not happen in football and
<br>therefore would not happen in chess.
<br>--&nbsp;<br></blockquote>
<br>In the chess world, the prearranged draw with the purpose of staying ahead of 
the rest
<br>of the field is routine with the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>present<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> scoring system. Sadly it does not
<br>elicit much outrage. There are also a few examples of players throwing games
<br>but those are far rarer, and are condemned. That is why an argument based
<br>on losing ~1/4 of your games on purpose in return for winning another ~1/4 by 
fraud
<br>is so ridiculous.
