In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov by sacrificing
a piece.  Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-mordem analysis,
Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed all possible
variations at least up to the point where the computer regained the
sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice the piece for
strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones.

It would be more accurate to say that Kasparov asserted that.  I don't
think his understanding of Deep Blue's play is really good enough for
him to understand how it makes decisions.  That's partly because the
algorithms are still secret, but mostly because it's clear from his
subsequent comments about the match that he still doesn't really
understand computers very well (not surprising, since he's a chess
player, not a computer scientist).

Your statement, "Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons," is just wrong.  There's no reason at
all that computer programs can't use "strategic" as well as "tactical"
criteria, and in fact all reasonable computer chess programs, and
certainly Deep Blue, have lots of "strategic" evaluation criteria, not
just the raw evaluation of material.  It's certainly possible for such
programs to evaluate strategic (positional) factors as being worth more
than a material deficit (although this is of course more likely to apply
to a deficit of a pawn than of a whole piece).
