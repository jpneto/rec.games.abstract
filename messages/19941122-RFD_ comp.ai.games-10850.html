Proposed Name: comp.ai.games
Description:   Discussion of AI in Games and Game-Playing
Proponent:     Dan Thies (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:rtfm@cyberspace.com">rtfm@cyberspace.com</a>)

Summary: A newsgroup for the discussion of artificial intelligence
applications in the domain of games and game playing.

Discussion will proceed for 30 days from the posting of this message to
news.groups, at which time (assuming no major issues need to be resolved)
the call for votes will be issued.  All follow-ups should be posted to
news.groups <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Your newsreader should take care of this for you.

This RFD is cross-posted to: comp.ai, rec.games.abstract, rec.games.design,
rec.games.programmer, rec.games.chess, rec.games.go.
If you know anyone who may be interested in this group who does not read 
these groups, please let them know about this RFD.

CHARTER:

    The newsgroup comp.ai.games will provide a forum for the discussion of
artificial intelligence in games and game-playing.  The group will explore
practical and theoretical aspects of applying artificial intelligence
concepts to the domain of game-playing.
    In addition to the traditional game areas such as chess and go, the
group will also welcome those seeking to bring artificial intelligence into
other computer games.  Computer games in this context would consist of games
played by humans against computers, and by computers (including robots)
against each other.
    This newsgroup is not an appropriate place for the discussion of machine
specific coding problems, nor is it the proper place to discuss strategies
for defeating computer opponents in existing games.  There are other
newsgroups already in existence to answer these questions.


BACKGROUND:

    The subject of artificial intelligence in games has come up very often
in many different newsgroups.  The main groups affected by this have been
the comp.ai.* and rec.games.* newsgroups, although every comp.sys.programmer
group sees AI questions occasionally.
    A dedicated newsgroup would give these common questions a logical place,
and provide a forum for more in-depth discussion and exploration of this
subject.  In addition to providing a resource for beginners in the field,
the group would allow serious researchers a forum for the exchange of ideas.
By bringing together people from different backgrounds, the group would
allow all participants an opportunity to explore new directions, and allow
everyone to learn from each other.
    An informal poll was taken by the proponent during the past six weeks,
with 178 responses.  Of these, 168 favored the creation of a newsgroup, and
10 were opposed.  Of those favoring the creation of a newsgroup, 143 favored
placing the group in the comp.ai.* heirarchy and 14 favored the rec.games.*
heirarchy.  Of those supporting the comp.ai.* placement, 102 were opposed
to anything in the rec.games.* heirarchy.


FAQ:

    The FAQ for this group will be maintained initially by myself, and will be
made available by weekly postings and worldwide web.  Eventually, we will have
enough information to separate the FAQ into domain-specific areas (chess, go,
searching, etc.)
