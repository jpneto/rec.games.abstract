The sample game was interesting to follow.  The basic tactics seem to
revolve around joining groups more efficiently than the opponent does,
capitalizing on the rule that lets you move to any adjacent point in a
group.  But I'm curious about the restriction that you can't split the
group any time during the move.  Is this really necessary?  The need
for it, if there is one, is not at all obvious to me.

It's a bit hard to explain.

You're right that, in order to ensure finitude, it's only necessary
that the group remains joined <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the move, even if it's split for
a moment during the move. However, that would imply that, in the rare
cases where this makes a difference, the available moves for a stone
depend not only on the "move closer" rule, but also on the "don't
split" rule; i.e. move generation would actually proceed this way:

- Can I move this stone? Yes, if taking it away doesn't split the
group OR it splits the group BUT you move it in such a way that it's
joined again AND you're closer to the closest friendly unit as a
result.

- Where can I move it? To any point adjacent to the same unit and
closer to the closest friendly unit AND which joins the moving unit
again in the rare case that it was split during the move.

In both steps, the two aforesaid rules have to be inquired. Instead,
in the current rules as written, the process is simpler: first the
"don't split" rule determines if a stone can be moved, without
reference to the second rule, and then the "move closer" rule
determines its available destination points, without further inquiring
the first rule; i.e.:

- Can I move this stone? Yes, if and only if taking it away doesn't
split the group.

- Where can I move it? To any point adjacent to the same unit and
closer to the closest friendly unit. Period.

Also, for this very reason, the game is easier to program on a
computer in this form. Otherwise, you'd have to write some extra code
which would only be of any use in very rare occasions.

I don't know if this all will make sense to anyone apart from myself,
but I do find the game simpler and more natural the way it is now.
Maybe I think too much like a computer ;-)
