I put this up on the ChessVariants.org website and could use some
feedback:

Introduction

This format was developed as a way to handle an uneven number of
players,
that normal brackets and round-robing and Swiss formats don't handle.
The
format handles anywhere from 3 to 100 (or more) equally well, but with
greater time demands, the more players involved.

This format is meant to be run electronically, or where there is a
moderator who can set up board between both players, and reset clocks.

In short, a player plays two games at same time (one of each color),
until
they lose a game, and then they are eliminated. Players play until two
players are left, and then the player with most wins, wins the
tournament.

Setup
Set up here refers to how players are assigned in a tournament.

For example, in a 10 player FIDE Chess Tournament:
Player 1 plays black against player 10, and white against player 2.
Player 2 plays black against player 1, and white against player 3.
Player 3 plays black against player 2, and white against player 4.
Player 4 plays black against player 3, and white against player 5.
Player 5 plays black against player 4, and white against player 6.
Player 6 plays black against player 5, and white against player 7.
Player 7 plays black against player 6, and white against player 8.
Player 8 plays black against player 7, and white against player 9.
Player 9 plays black against player 8, and white against player 10.
Player 10 plays black against player 9, and white against player 1.

This format is fairly robust in how players are allocated.

Pieces
Same as in whatever game is being played.

Rules
Play is as follows:
A player play until that player lose a game, and then that player are
eliminated. Once a player is eliminated the two players he was playing
face off against each other. For example, if player 3 was defeated by
either player 2 or player 4, then player 2 will battle player 4, with
player 2 playing black against player 4. This elimination process
continues until there are two remaining players, and the player with
the
most amount of wins is crowned winner. In case of tie for wins,
players
play two games until they lose one game. A player can lose by standard
victory conditions or run out of time.

Players tying can be handled one of several ways. One way is to have
players replay the tie until there is a winner, or one of two players
is
eliminated by an opponent. The other way to handle a tie is to have
the
tie eliminate both players.

When one player defeats another player, in a game not run over the
computer, the player who just one notifies their opponent that there
is a
new game. The player then pauses the clock on their other game, sets
up
the new game, and then continues with their other game. If the player
who
just won is white, they would then make their move and start clock. If
they are black, they would set up game and start clock for their new
game.


Feedback here is welcomed (well, outside of saying it is stupid and
waste of time).
