Have you tried roleplaying games?

I've tried games of all kinds.  I've been sort of a game-aholic all my
life.

I find roleplaying games wonderfully imaginative and immersive, but I
don' t like the feeling of being inside a story and having to make my
way along a predetermined "story line."  Even when the story line is a
complex "tree" with various possible outcomes, I still get the feeling
of being confined, and it goes against my grain.

As to face-to-face group roleplaying games--well, that's something I
haven't tried.  But I wouldn't want to.  Social interaction is NOT a
big part of game playing to me.  I'm a little weird that way:  most of
the time I'm actually happier playing games against a computer AI than
with other people.

This past weekend, I spent way too many hours playing Disciples II
Gold--a turn-based computer strategy game with a fantasy-fiction theme.
 That game-playing experience was close to being ideal for me.  The
only things I disliked about it were: (1) there's still a "story line"
of sorts, (2) it's such a little-known game that all my efforts are
sure to go unsung, and (3) there's no convenient way to measure how
good a player I am.

Chess corrects all these problems: (1) Though it's a set-piece
"battle," the game can develop in many, many different ways.  (2) It's
such a well-known game that if I say to somebody, "I've become a
reasonably strong chess player," it'll mean something.  (3) The rating
system is a convenient way to track my playing strength.

No role-playing in chess, I guess, but I can live without that.
