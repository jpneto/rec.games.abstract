|&gt; Jeff's comment --- Randomized chess replaces one arbitrary setup with
|&gt; another. Unachess eliminates the setup. 

If "randomized chess" means that the back row is randomly re-arranged (but
kept the same for both colors) while the pawns are kept on the second row,
then I agree it's arbitrary, and thus undesirable.  It's also not all that
nice to see random elements in a chess-like game.

However.

There is a nice variation, that must have been invented, named, and played
scores of times before, that seems to me to capture the intent of randomized 
chess even better. (I'm presuming that this intent is to keep as close to chess
as possible so that chess skills are exercised, but to avoid the pain of
having to learn booksful of opening tedium.)

The obvious thing is to start with all the pawns on the second row, and have
the players put their back-row pieces on their back rows, alternately, starting
with white. After all 16 are placed, white starts play as at standard chess,
(the only other difference being that their is no castling). One should also
use the restriction that each bishop pair end up with mixed colors. 

Thus chess skills are fully maintained, including opening skills, but without
the necessity to learn vast opening variations. In fact, because these become
irrelevant, it can be argued that opening skills are more important than ever.

Another big advantage to this version, besides those mentioned above, is that
as white has to place his pieces slightly before black, this gives an extra
advantage that helps offset the natural first-move advantage.  Indeed, it may
even conceivably be that black has a slight advantage in this game, though it
seems unlikely.

Anyway, it seems an excellent chess variation, and I wonder why it isn't popular.
