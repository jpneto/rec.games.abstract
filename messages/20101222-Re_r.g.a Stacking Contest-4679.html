Rules and Conditions

Game Restrictions:
1.	Stacking as part of the mechanism.
2.	2 players
3.	Must be an Abstract aka no luck, hidden info, dexterity element
etc
4.	Must be a game not finished/released yet.
5.	One entry per person

Allowances:
1.	Concerning topology.  Since we're not worried about an
implementation prize I say we crack this wide open.  If it can't be
played in the iggc sandbox we can play it  in google docs (or
somewhere else if someone has any suggestions) during the playing and
deciding phase.

Deadline:
Because of the holidays and because one is a date of significance to
me I'd like to make the deadline for the entry Feb 9th and the
deadline for the decision Feb 23rd.  3pm Berlin time for both dates.
All entrants into the contest are more than highly encouraged to vote.

Choosing a winner:
You can't vote for your own game.  Ties will be resolved by voting
again between people tied for 1st.  If there are still ties then we
can fight about which game is better here (really this isn't my
expertise so I'm open to suggestions although I rather like this one
^_^ )

Prize:
Honest BGG full review of the winning game from each of the
participants.
