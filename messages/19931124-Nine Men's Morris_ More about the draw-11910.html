I would like to answer some questions that came up regarding
the solution of Nine Men's Morris.

- How can a draw be reached?

A draw is reached through cyclical play, whereby neither
player can (or will) close a mill. Note that since the proof
was obtained using only the 9-9, 9-8 and 8-8 databases, neither
player need close more than one mill to reach a draw ,thereby
avoiding a loss with less than three stones.


- What is an optimal opening strategy (for humans)?

I must admit that I have not examined the opening moves
for any easily describable patterns. 
However, the examination of mid- and endgame databases
has repeatedly shown optimal play to be beyond human
comprehension. Therefore, I very much doubt that any such
simple-to-describe strategy exists. 


- Is a paper describing these results available?

I am now working on such a paper. I will send a copy to those
of you who have requested one as soon as it is completed.

There is however a paper describing some initial results
of the retrograde analysis phase of the project:

Gasser, R., "Applying Retrograde Analysis to Nine Men's 
Morris", Heuristic Programming in Artificial
Intelligence 2: the Second Computer Olympiad, Levy, D.N.L.
and Beal, D.F. (Eds.), pp. 161-173, Ellis Horwood, London.


- Is the program available?

Making the program available is something of a problem 
because of the databases it uses. In total the databases 
amount to a few hundred MBytes.

There is of course a program available which plays without
any database (or with a few small db's). While this program
cannot claim to be invincible, it plays quite strongly, having
won a match against the British Champion.

This program was developed under the Smart Game Board and 
therefore only runs on Macintosh computers. The program
is shareware and depending on the number of requests, I will
either make it available via ftp or snail mail.
