No offense intended, Bill, but it should be clear from the diagram
that the closed end is simply a hexagonally tessellated, regular
hexagon.  I know some people have had trouble with the diagram so,
just for their benefit, let me describe how the cylinder is
constructed.  You cut the star shape from the rule sheet, not
including the wide arcs, so that you have a regular hexagon with a
long rectangle extending outward from each of the six sides, a
starfish shape.  Then you make six 90 degree folds where the arms meet
the body.  Once the cutout has been so folded, the rectangles are
joined side by side and you have a roughly cylindrical shape with a
hexagonal cross section.  One end is open and the other end is closed.

If you take the Super Lariat board (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/">http://www.marksteeregames.com/</a>
Super_Lariat_rules.html) and cut off one of the three protrusions, you
have the cylinder used in Lariat.  If you look at the fourth picture
in the Super Lariat rules, you can see that the center cell on the end
is highlighted.

the "key point" ...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The whole point of applying the lariat principle to a cylinder was to
make the end, center cell no more valuable than any other cell -
certainly not "key".  For the sake of argument, say the length of the
cylinder is 10 times the circumference.  It'd be a lot easier to
circle the cylinder, to form a lariat near the lip, than to extend a
ray all the way from the end, center cell to the lip.  The end, center
cell would have much less strategic value than a lip cell for
example.  For ergonomics, I chose not to use an exceedingly long
cylinder - just long enough to considerably devalue the end, center
cell.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, the skirted umbrella would make for a simpler 2D form of the
game, but it would demolish the aesthetics of a 3D board which is
ultimately the intended shape of the board in a real world incarnation
as well as a program with a 3D rendition (where you could rotate the
cylinder and make your moves).  You've got a 3D shape wallpapered with
a perfectly uniform, hexagonal tessellation that merges seemlessly
from face to face.  Any departure from that would be an abomination.

Super Lariat absolutely must be played on a 3D implementation, real
world or programmed.  There's no skirted umbrella for that.  A 2D form
would have to have separate diagrams for each of the three cylinders
and the body, with some sort of absurdly complicated scheme connecting
the separate diagrams.

This makes it essnetially a Hex game with one of the players

the other having regular Hexlike borders.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have to strongly disagree with you there, Bill.  Lariat isn't even
distantly related to Hex beyond the fact that they're both connection
games played on a hexagonally tessellated board, even with the skirted
umbrella incarnation.  In Hex, Black has an assigned orientation 90
degrees perpendicular to White's orientation.  Technically it's an
unequal goals game, even though the goals are the same but just
rotated 90 degrees.  Lariat is an equal goals game with no preassigned
orientations for the players.  Even if you choose to claim the end,
center cell, you're not committed to drawing a ray from there to the
lip.

This doesn't sound
sufficiently different from Hex to be worthwhile; I daresay
that with different connections on the umbrellas part of it
the game could be made more funly different, but not greatly so.

That's why I think the (accicentally invented!) purely flat hexagonal
version is more different - enough to have a unique flavour of its
own!

OC it needs severe equalisation.

I would never release a game that needed severe equalization - hence
the cylinder.  It took me years just to come to terms with the pie
rule, a necessary evil in these connection games.

My plan of playing Unlur-style is one way,
and Nick's plan for having one player make all the initial moves is
another.

I think Nick's is game-theoretically superior, perhaps; but I think
mine is socially superior, as it doesn't require one player to do
ALL the initial work, but spreads it out evenly.

Nice to be part of an accidental-team game-construction gang!

I do appreciate the enthusiasm, and the skirted umbrella is a clever
idea.  I can't get behind equalization schemes, but that's just me.
