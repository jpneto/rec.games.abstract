lol, It does??  Let me just restate axiom C, this axiom you're having so
much trouble with:

"Axiom C:  The purpose of a game contest is to determine the best game in
the
contest."

Is this really a problem for you, Christian??  :D

Axiom C implies this????  Christian, I trust a judge panel more than a
public composed of retards and your fan club to render a quality vote.  How
does this translate to me only trusting myself to vote for my own game?  It
doesn't even make sense.  Self voting was ruled out from the outset.

What you fail to understand, Christian, is that a subjective vote doesn't
have to be a stupid and biased vote.

No, Christian.  I have no interest in you boosting my popularity.  That
really shouldn't be necessary in a game contest.

I know that.  What, you can talk about future contests and I can't?
