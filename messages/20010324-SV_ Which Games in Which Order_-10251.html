Whew, that's a pretty good selection to be the first time you purchase
abstract games. I have been near-addicted for a while now, and I still
didn't get around to buying most of these. Of course, assuming your husband
is interested in playing too, you already have an easier time than me.

My suggestion would be to start off with Pente and Octi, and if you like
these, you should have a go at Go. The reason I think that these first 2 are
good games for new palyers is that:

Pente is a simple game, without too many rules to learn on the first go. It
is also fairly simple to develop strategies on your own.
Octi is a visible game, in the sense that you can easily see what the moves
do, and develop good strategies although it seems pretty complex.

Go is really, really difficult, but it can be fun to try. Playing Go without
any feedback from someone who played Go before is probably not to recommend.
However, I think it is a game you should have a taste of.

For the rest, Zertz, Quarto, Quoridor and Cathedral are games that I could
never play seriously, because they have a feel of a quick puzzle to me
instead. Zertz is still one of my favorites.

Abalone, Gipf, and Othello are games that some people like, but that easily
get a feel of being completely incomprehensible in terms of strategy for a
new player.

Chebache contains dice, so I never tried it :)
