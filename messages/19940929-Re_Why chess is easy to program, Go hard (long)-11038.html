I believe that go is harder to program than chess for three reasons:

So?  Scrabble has a 15x15 board and 27 different playing pieces.  Quite
possibly it has a state space bigger than chess or go.  But I imagine it
would be almost trivial to write a Scrabble program that could beat
any human.

  If strong go programs arise, it will be

This is exactly the same thing they were saying about chess computers 
twenty years ago.

Computer chess is a bunch of trickery.  One trick is simply
representing a chess game using a computer.  Another is simulating
thinking with a minimax seach.  New tricks, like alpha-beta and 
hash tables, were discovered that greatly enchance the old tricks.
 
These chess tricks have little to with how good players think.  Why
should the undiscovered go tricks be any different?

2. Go is far more symmetric than chess.  The different pieces and their
  moves actually makes tactical analysis easier in chess than in go.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nonsense.  Go may very well be more difficult to tactically analyze
than chess, but this has nothing to do with symmetry or piece
variety.  In general, more piece variety means more complex
tactics.  Take away a few flavors of chess piece, you have a
tactically simpler game.  Or add an new kind of go piece, and
your tactics will probably go throught the roof.

Context is important in just about every game.

3. Go evaluation functions must be global to be meaninful whereas chess

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean.  Most every chess evaluation
function I have seen looks at the whole position.  Sounds global to me.

  This means that not
  only does a go program need to consider many more positions than a
  chess program, but it needs to spend much more time considering each
  position if it is to do anything meaningful with it.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So far, using techniques developed for chess, a computer has to look at 
more positions longer in go.  But this probably has something to do
with fact that they are DIFFERENT GAMES.  A car works well on land,
but takes a serious performance hit crossing an ocean.  Does this
mean boats are harder to build?
