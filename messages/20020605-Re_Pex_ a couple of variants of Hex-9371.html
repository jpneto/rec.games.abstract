Okay, if I CHANGE it, it will be DIFFERENT.
That doesn't mean the pattern isn't distinct from a hex grid, as is.

Well, the pentagonal tilings I use aren't quite symmetric either,
in terms of presenting exactly the same task to each player.
The Pex14 board is particularly bad in this regard. I'm not
satisfied with the way I defined the border regions there. At least,
the Pex11 board satisfies these criteria:

* board overall shape is symmetric-looking
* all four border rows contain the same number of cells (12)
* the minimum length path connecting border rows is the same
  for each side (10)

But for Pex14, it looks like I will have to sacrifice a symmetric
appearance or reduce the length of one or both black border rows,
in order to produce a fair contest.

Of course, the first move advantage should still be taken care of
with the pie rule. I suppose I could try to produce an even game
on the unbalanced Pex14 board by saying White goes first without
a pie rule, but it's not at all clear that would work. The board
might be so unbalanced as is, that the first move is not enough.

If more than one type of shape is allowed for the cells, there are
certainly lots of patterns that could be used. As far as the game is
concerned, all that matters is the topology. The official Y board
plays on the intersections instead of in the cells, but if cells were
drawn, there would be just three copies of each distinct shape,
six copies of most shapes if you include reflections.
