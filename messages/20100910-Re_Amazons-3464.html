I don't hate all games except my own.  I even hate some of my own

What I do hate is chop shop "design" that hijacks Amazons' defining
mechanism.

Everyone's a designer now.  Connection games design is interesting and
can be somewhat easy compared to non-connection game design.  Puke on
a Hex board and you've practically designed a new game.  No, that
wasn't an insult directed at any particular game.  I'm just saying, I
think we're getting a little saturated with Hex variants at this point.

There seem to be two games now that superimpose Amazons mechanics onto
the Hex connection goal, one called "Pollux" and one called "Canvas".
My impress is that neither one is as interesting as either Amazons or
Hex.
