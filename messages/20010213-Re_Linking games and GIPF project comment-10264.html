I am interested in finding out about any sort of games that
involve the "linking" of several independent games.

... In the GIPF project the
two games Tamsk and Zertz, in addition to being independent games, are
more like "subroutines" to the main game Gipf. ...

If you have much integration between the different games, then you lose
the individuality.  Examples:

- go: you have lots of little battles for life played simultaneously on
a 19x19 board.  It is possible to lose most of these fights yet still
win the game.

- many wargames have lots of skirmishes within a larger scenario.

... few people would regard these as linked games, but they seem to be
what you're aiming for.
