First let me express my sympathy for both Tinsley and the Chinook team for
the unfortunate turn of events.  

Since Tinsley resigned the match due to ill health, and since the Chinook
team have stated that they did not want this unearned title, why do they
not resign it, and <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>then<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> challenge Lafferty, the new World Champion, for 
the World Championship title?  This would keep Si Graphics and the Computer
Museum happy as well as being a gesture of respect toward Tinsley.  (Not that
I am suggesting that the Chinook team has been in any way disrespectful.)

Then there can still (hopefully) be a rematch with Tinsley in the future,
should the Chinook team win against Lafferty.

In any case, I have the greatest respect and admiration for both Tinsley and
the Chinook team for their monumental, and very different, efforts in 
mastering this combinatorial game.

Regards,
Matt
