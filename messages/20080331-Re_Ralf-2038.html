I don't argue that it's exploding, but are you sure that your public
persona has no effect whatsoever on it?  For all you know, the guy who
you ripped a new asshole a year ago might otherwise have recommended
you and your games to another 10 sites.

Believe me I'm not the tiniest bit worried about it.  My games are
already on most of the sites that have non-classical abstract games.
There aren't ten more.  Game site owners want what they consider to be
good games on their game sites.  They all know about my games already
and I'm sure they couldn't care less about what flame wars I get into,
as long as it doesn't happen on their site.

I appreciate all the concern but what happens with my games in the
next few decades doesn't even matter that much.  The acceptance of
games in society is a very, very slow process.  The good ones will
take root eventually and the bad ones won't.  My games won't achieve
their potential until long after I'm gone, the ones that don't fade
into obscurity.  I'm very confident that Tanbo, Cephalopod, Dipole,
and Crossway are in it for the long haul.  A few of them won't make it
and a few could go either way.  It's too early to tell.  I'll have a
better idea in twenty years.
