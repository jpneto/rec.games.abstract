Well I did not totally have no external help as I had read the
scientific american article about it before i saw my first cube. In
that it described a notation to describe moves and gave the concept of
algorithms.
I used this an paper to work out most of the required algorithms on
paper still without a cube in hand

The first cube I handled was in the back seat of a car and I got quite
car sick looking at it with awe

then finally found a source to buy them and managed to get it out in
30 mins

However on my next try I found my repertoire was missing a double edge
flip which I had not foreseen

It took some time after that to find that algorithm.

But then I had my own algorithm

I still have not looked at a book and managed to get my method down
below 2 minutes - but it is entirely my own.

I still reckon that it is the best puzzle ever invented.

And I take pride in the fact that my algorithm - perhaps not a great
one - will solve any puzzle - and it is MINE
