Great.  Here an obvious fact for you to reflect on, Christian.  You wouldn't
even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>be<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> here at rec.games.abstract if I hadn't cajoled you into joining. 
In your own words:

"Thanks Mark for dragging me in :)"

And I really did have to drag you in.  Alex (Gamer-man) was so reluctant to
join, I actually had to create a gmail account for him before he would agree
to post here.

Before I could even invite anyone to rec.games.abstract I had to shut down
Bill Taylor's squatter's club.  Bill Taylor was pumping so much hot gas into
the group it was buoyant.  There's no way a contest could have taken place
in that environment, or anything else other than nimrods like Harald
Korneliussen licking Bill Taylor's balls.

 From your point of view, Christian, and everyone else who just joined in the
past few months, the contest just seems like a spontaneous event.  And it
is, in a sense.  But who created the environment facilitating a spontaneous
contest?  A lot of groundwork had to be done in preparation.  A lot more
work than what you and Daniel have put into the contest itself.  You're hell
bent on crediting yourself and Daniel for the contest, Christian, but please
note that contests don't take place in a vacuum.
