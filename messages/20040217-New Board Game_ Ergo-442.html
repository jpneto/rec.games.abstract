<div class="moz-text-plain"><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A friend and I thought this up in our math class.  The basic idea was
to produce a game with the following conditions:

1.  Possible instant wins.
2.  Very few pieces.
3.  Structural inability to block with your own pieces.  (partially
fulfilled)

And here it is, we call it "Ergo".

Play begins on a 4x4 board with each player controlling 4 pieces, the
pieces are arranged in the following layout.  "-" is an open square,
"x" is a black piece, and "o" is a white piece.

   a b c d
4  - - - -
3  x o x o
2  o x o x
1  - - - -

Movement rules(applying to all moves):

1.  No two pieces can occupy the same square.
2.  A piece may not land in the same square twice during any part of
its turn, however, it may jump over the square more than once in any
given turn.
3.  If a piece performs any <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>jumping<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> move, he may perform another
legal jumping move provided he lands in a square adjacent to the piece
he wishes to jump.

A player may move in the following ways:

4.  One square orthoganally or diagonally.
5.  Over a single piece, in a jumping fashion, orthoganally or
diagonally.
6.  Over a piece "bouncing" off the wall, such that he lands in a
square 90 degrees away from the piece, in the direction of the bounce.
 It is easiest to think of this rule as pieces moving in a certain
direction, and retaining that inertia until they land in the desired
square, making them available to jump again in the direction they
desire.
Example:
  a b c d           a b c d  
4 - - - -         4 - - - -
3 - - - -    --&gt;  3 - - o -
2 - - - x         2 - - - x
1 - - o -         1 - - - -
White to play can jump from c1, over d2, "bouncing" off the wall into
c3, but he could not jump back to c1 over d2 as he's already been in
that square.
  
  a b c d
4 - - - -
3 - - - -
2 - - x o
1 - - - -
Black in this example cannot jump from c2, over d2, back into c2
because it would place him in the same square twice.

7.  A piece may also bounce over a corner piece provided he is
orthoganally adjacent to it.  This move causes the piece to take on
the direction of the other wall touching the opposing piece.
Example:
  a b c d           a b c d
4 - - - -         4 - - - -           1. c1-d1-d2 (notation includes
covered
3 - - - -   --&gt;   3 - - - -                        squares, whether a
piece
2 - - - -         2 - - - o                        jumps or lands on a
square.)
1 - - o x         1 - - - x

8.  Any piece in jumping motion may "slide" over another piece,
provided he keeps his same direction during the entire "slide".
Example:
  a b c d
4 - - - -  White can play 1. c3-d2-d1-b2 or 1. d3-d2-d1-c1-b1  
3 - - o o      but not 1. c3-d2-d1-c1-b2 and not 1. d3-d2-c1-b2
2 - - - x
1 - - x x

  a b c d
4 - - x -  A slide can also include multiple bounces, for instance,
white can
3 - x - o  play 1.d3-c4-b3-a2-b1-c2-b3-a4.  (Which is a triple-bounce
slide to
2 x - - -  c2 followed by a jump over b3.)
1 - x - -

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Remember<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that a piece can be jumped over twice, but a player cannot
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>land<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> in the same square twice in the same turn.

Those are all the movement rules, they are the most difficult part to
learn.

Scoring rules:
1.  Play continues until eight points are scored by one player.
2.  Single jumps and non jumping moves score zero points.
3.  Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 2 pieces in a
single turn scores one point.
4.  Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 3 pieces in a
single turn scores two points.
5.  Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 4 non-distinct
pieces in a single turn scores four points.
6.  Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) all 4 of the
opponents pieces in a single turn wins the game instantly.
7.  If three moves are repeated in a row, or a series of moves
repeated three times in a row, play is considered a draw, regardless
of either players points.  (No games played so far have ended in a
draw, but please share if it happens to you)

Notationally, after a turn, you would write in parenthesis the total
points scored by a player, with W representing an instant win.

The movement rules can be very confusing, so if you have any
questions, please post here and i'll try to answer them for you.

Here is a sample beginning for you.  It would be fairly easy to follow
on a chess/checker board with pawns/checkers.

  a b c d
4 - - - -  
3 x o x o
2 o x o x
1 - - - -

 White                        Black
1. b3-b4                      c3-c2!

White threatened two double lines on b3 and c3.  Blacks counter looks
like it gives White advantage, but after 2. b4-b3-b2-b1 (1) black
plays ...b3-a2-b1-c2-d4-c4 (W) and after 2. b4-a3-b2-c1-d2-c3 (2)
Black wins with ...b3-a2-b1-c2-d3-c4-c3-c2-c1 (W)

2. b4-a3-b2-c1 (1)   

White decides to score a point.              

                              b3-a2-b1-c1-d1 (2)

Black counters with two points, and would have liked to move back to
b3, but can't because he started on that square.

The following position is reached with W=1 and B=2 with white set to
win one point by c1-b2-a3-b4(1) or c1-d2-c3-b2-a1(1)
  a b c d
4 - - - -
3 x - - o
2 o x o x
1 - - o x


I'm not going to use any more of this game, because I just wanted to
illustrate some actual play, but if you have any questions at all ,
please ask, and i'll try to help you out as soon as I can (could be a
few days.)  The game is very fun, and the strategy is surprisingly
elusive.  Have fun with this one.
