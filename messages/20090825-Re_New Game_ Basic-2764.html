If you're going to invest an entire page criticizing something I
wrote, you have an obligation to actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>read what I said<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> first.
This strawman business of criticizing at length something I never said
or even vaguely implied is fucking obnoxious.  The regulars in this
group are like a bunch of crows waiting for something to pick to
death.  Never a compliment.  Never "Nice job on Hex KB, Mark."  Only
the picking.  Only "Oh I skimmed through Mark Steere's latest post and
it looked like he was bragging about something.  Something nice and
juicy to swoop in and pick at."

I wasn't bragging about anything.  My point was that my invention of
Basic was completely serendipitous.  I had started with the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>objective<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of constructing the largest game tree that I possibly
could, which objective I then abandoned when I realized I had found an
extremely simple game.  End of design.  End of story.  It turns out
that the size of the game tree <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>for a game using Checkers equipment<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
does seems pretty respectable to me, someone who's actually been
playing the game a few hours per day for the past few days.  Does it
compare in size to Go's game tree?  No!  I never said it did!

Your point about
restricting to Checkers equipment is valid, but your original post did
not mention such ergonomic restrictions.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I can't believe you clowns consider it a "restriction" that a game
specifically designed for the Checkers set should actually be
physically playable with a Checkers set.  Your previous suggestion
about allowing directly forward movement in Basic would have rendered
the game completely unplayable in real life.  As I said in an earlier
post, you'd need a special set of tongs or something to extract
checkers from tightly surrounded stacks in your mutilated version of
my game.

Mentioning them now is
perfectly O.K., but please do so in a more civil manner.

Math people blow so much hot air in this group that it's becoming
buoyant.  Listen, learn, and if you have nothing positive or
constructive to contribute, be quiet.

As Nick mentions, allowing backwards movement will greatly increase the
size of the game tree, as it will roughly double the number of squares
each piece can reach.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course.  As Nick mentioned.  Allowing backward movement would cause
the game tree to become larger.  In fact it would become infinite!  It
would turn the game into a Waltz, with pieces chasing each other
around the board until a draw has to be declared.  What would the
objective even be?  Never mind.  Please, don't answer that.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Regardless, the size of the game tree is not necessarily a measure of
the quality of the game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No but a substantial tree is a requirement for rich gameplay and
resistance to the onset of move order advantage.  A big tree won't
guarantee a good game, but a small tree will guarantee a bad game.
