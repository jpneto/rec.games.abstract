SET has won many awards and is played by millions worldwide.  Below is a
brief description of the rules.

Rules
The object of the game is to identify a 'Set' of three cards from 12 cards
laid out on the table. Each card has a variation of the following four
features:
(A) Color:
Each card is red, green, or purple.

(B) Symbol:
Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.

(C) Number:
Each card has one, two, or three symbols.

(D) Shading: Each card is solid, open, or striped.

A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on
each card OR is different on each card. That is to say, any feature in the
'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on
each card.

The Magic Rule
If two are... and one is not, then it is not a 'Set'.
