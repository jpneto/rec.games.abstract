The Fantasy Rule Game is a Nomiclike Game which is, like Nomic,
played via a server.
 
People propose Rules of which the only requirement is that they
are consistent with all valid earlier Rules.
 
The last Player succeeding in posting a valid Rule wins.
 
A short, six-rule example follows.
 
Rule 1:
All subsequent fantasy rules must be shorter than any other valid rule
posted in the current round.  For the purposes of this rule, "shorter"
means "has fewer characters".
 
Rule 2:
Don't use the word 'nim'.
 
Rule 3:
Rules make sense.
 
Rule 4:
BE YOU
 
Rule 5:
Win!
 
Rule 6:
B
 
(B as a useful acronym for "BE".
As to why it's legal: It is the shortest possible sensible rule
and must therefore, by Rule 1 and Rule 3, win. So it satisfies Rule 5.)
 
 
===
Of course the Game stands and falls with a little bit of cooperation.
A (first) Rule like "Rules are only valid if posted by me" is legal,
winning and No Fun.
 
Rounds may last from either a few Rules to more than 30.
The latter record was set for a Round were the theme was the
creation of a new language.
Other themes were Scrabble, Logical puzzles, Limericks.
 
Round 21 of the Fantasy Rule Game will start sometime next week.
If you want to play, you have to subscribe to the server:
a message to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:majordomo@nvg.unit.no">majordomo@nvg.unit.no</a> will do.  The subject doesn't
matter and the body should contain a line like "subscribe frc".  If the
body contains "help" on a line of its own you'll get instructions.
If you send mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:frc-request@nvg.unit.no">frc-request@nvg.unit.no</a> you'll get back instructions
specific to frc.
 
The server itself has for address <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:frc@nvg.unit.no">frc@nvg.unit.no</a>. Any message send
there will bounce to all people subscribed to the list.
