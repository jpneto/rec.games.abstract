<br>&nbsp; I think you're reading too much into the OP's use of the first-person 
plural. I see no indication that he's more than one person, let alone
<br>a "company"! He's just one guy trying to learn programming through
<br>making simple games.
<br>&nbsp; To the OP: No, I will not subscribe to a mailing list, or even register
<br>for an account with Google, just to read about your game, which I don't 
expect would be much fun anyway, seeing as it's described as "Tic Tac
<br>Toe Plus ... actually a Tic Tac Toe game ... not a completed game".
<br>If you really want strangers to download it, put it on a Web page with
<br>documentation and source code.
<br>&nbsp; Alternatively, get your parents to play it. That's how I "beta-tested"
<br>the video games I made as a kid (which of course never saw the light of
<br>day), and I didn't turn out bad. :)
