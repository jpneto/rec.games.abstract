Here is a game for 2 players.
The game's name is a combination of the words "permutation" and
"palindrome".

Start with an n-by-n grid,
where n is a multiple of 4.
I suggest that n is &gt;= 8.

The players take turns. On a turn a player draws two x's into the
grid, each x into an empty square such that no column or row has more
than one x.

After there is exactly one x in each row and in each column -- n x's
total, n/4 moves for each player -- play is over.

Write down the (n-1) absolute values in order, of the changes in the
vertical positions of adjacent x's from column to column, along the
bottom of the grid.
Write down the (n-1) absolute values in order, of the changes in the
horizontal positions of adjacent x's from row to row, along the left
side of the grid.

Player 1 gets as a score the length of the largest palindromic
subsequence within the sequence of vertical changes written along the
bottom of the grid.

Player 2 gets as a score the length of the largest palindromic
subsequence within the sequence of horizontal changes written along
the left side of the grid.

Largest score wins. (Ties are possible.)

Example: n=12:

.. . x . . . . . . . . .
.. . . . x . . . . . . .
.. . . . . . x . . . . .
x . . . . . . . . . . .
.. . . . . x . . . . . .
.. . . . . . . x . . . .
.. x . . . . . . . . . .
.. . . x . . . . . . . .
.. . . . . . . . x . . .
.. . . . . . . . . . . x
.. . . . . . . . . . x .
.. . . . . . . . . x . .

Changes in vertical positions column to column:
3,6,7,6,3,2,3,3,3,1,1
The largest palindromic subsequence is (3,6,7,6,3). Player 1 gets 5
points.

Changes in horizontal positions row to row:
2,2,6,5,2,6,2,5,3,1,1,
The largest palindromic subsequence is (5,2,6,2,5). Player 2 gets 5
points.

It is a tie.

What about strategies for this game?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
