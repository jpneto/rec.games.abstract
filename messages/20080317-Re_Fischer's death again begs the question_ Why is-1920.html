<br>Perhaps you missed the article where I observed that getting 22+ people
<br>some of whom aren't very bright to collude is much harder than 2 chess
<br>players; that there is no point at which a football match is definitely
<br>drawn; and that collusion has in fact happened in football?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Read and refuted. You yourself came up with an example of how
<br>soccer players participated in throwing a game, showing that their
<br>number and intelligence are not a significant obstacle. The fact
<br>that football is never "definitely drawn" was shown to be
<br>a red herring. (Neither is chess) The key is that at some point
<br>the return of tossing the coin is higher than the return of playing on fairly,
<br>yet it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>doesn't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> produce that change of behavior.
<br>
<br>The simple fact is that there are already cheating possibilities
<br>in football, chess, and just about everything else, yet people
<br>still engage in those activities. Changing the scoring in chess
<br>would not significantly increase the cheating possibilities, so
<br>raising that as a reason not to make the scoring change is
<br>an invalid argument.
<br>
<br>Like it or not.
