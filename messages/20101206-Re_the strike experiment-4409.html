On your turn:
Place 2 stones or Strike with a stone in play.

Place - 2 stones anywhere on the board not adjacent to your own color

Strike - Slide an already placed stone of your color X number of
spaces in a straight line to an empty cell directly adjacent to a
group of size X enemy stones.  Exchange all of this groups stones with
stones of your color.  A stone may not strike a group it's already
connected to.

Mark already mentioned this: why two. It shifts play from the
strategical to the tactical and it speeds up the game. Both might be
ok, but I'd make it part of the playtesting (possibly you've already
done that and reached the conclusion that two is better).

There's also the possibility that a striking stone connects two groups
in the strike: one of a size equal to the lenghts of the strike, the
other not necessarily (and mostly not). Theoretically the stroking
stone could even end up touching three enemy groups.

Then: the striking stone might connect the enemy target group to one
of the player himself (or even two). The resulting group might easily
be 'oversized'.

Depending on boardsize, but a hardwired number is arbitrary just the
same. Nick's own experiments led to 'the largest group' in
'Byg' (second largest if equal and so on). That's not arbitrary and I
find it more elegant.

True, the LOA idea in a new jacket. That's the focuspoint, but you
might want to take a closer look at the right kind of filler.

Well, we all have our hang-ups here. And I can't very well argue
against flipping after the last bundle of games can I? ;-)
As a 'manual' mechanic, both flipping and exchanging suck.

Your very own stones turn into your horrible opponent's stones.

Yeah, that's because they're not 'your very own stones' in the first
place - they should do something about that! ;-)

That's pretty dramatic to me. And a stone coming in from all the way
across the board to change your biggest group to it's color seemed
like a rather satisfying mechanic to show it.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I agree. It has the basic ingredient for a dramatic game, but I'd not
be satisfied with the filling just yet. Arbitrary object and the
possibility of 'oversized' groups by simultaneously striking a size-X
group while connecting to a friendly group. I'd look for something
that solves both of those simultaneously.
