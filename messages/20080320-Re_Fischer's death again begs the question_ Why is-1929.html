<br><blockquote type=cite>Changing the scoring in chess
<br>would not significantly increase the cheating possibilities
<br></blockquote>
<br>Factually inaccurate. It's been pointed out that changing the scoring
<br>system as you suggest increases the advantage of cheating.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>The specific example did <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> do that, because it was
<br>ridiculous and impractical.
<br>
<br>And you are forgetting that there are other ways to cheat,
<br>probably far more effective. (connect to Fritz. e.g.). So effectively
<br>the cheating possibilities are unchanged. And don't forget that
<br>changing the scoring will <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>decrease<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> draw-based cheating, so
<br>overall there would be a decrease in dishonest collusion.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Now to throw something concrete into this. Freakonomics (Levitt and
<br>Dubner) quote numerous examples of cheating (teachers to name one
<br>less obvious example). But in particular they quote good statistical
<br>evidence that sumo wrestlers throw matches. This is precisely what
<br>you are arguing wouldn't happen in chess. Given we already have
<br>evidence (agreed draws) that chess players aren't moral paragons
<br>(and I think Bobby Fischer blew that one too) there's a near certainty
<br>they'd be doing something similar. (Maybe the coin toss, or they
<br>could auction the game throw between them in advance, with an
<br>agreed signal when it's invoked by mutual agreement. That solves
<br>most of the problems you raise, even though a simple coin toss is
<br>mostly good enough.)
<br></blockquote>
<br>Collusion to draw is widely accepted and part
<br>of the game. Even chess' rules are not clear on the issue, and
<br>the rules that do exist are almost never enforced.
<br>
<br>Losing on purpose is a far bigger moral step. There are very few
<br>documented cases of thrown games.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>And to return to Fischer. When he was on top, most of his
<br>opponents were Soviet grandmasters. It's well recorded that the
<br>USSR authorities would instruct players what to do. With a net
<br>gain from throwing games, they would have been laughing all the
<br>way.
<br>
<br>And finally, what's the problem with draws? Apart from that draws
<br>can be instructive and interesting, let's just suppose they aren't,
<br>and that 80% of games are draws (I think it's slightly less than
<br>that). So only 20% of games are interesting. Who has time to
<br>watch even that 20%? The only people who'd have to watch draws
<br>are people watching a single game, live. And we can pretty much
<br>assume those people are chess enthusiasts, and they clearly
<br>don't mind draws.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's not that draws are never interesting or that there is some
<br>threshold of draw incidence below which chess becomes interesting.
<br>It's that when the return on playing for a win is low (as with the
<br>current scoring), players don't do it. So games are not fully contested
<br>(because contesting games is non-optimal). In effect draws between
<br>GMs statistically aren't full games, they are partial games, yet the
<br>existing scoring system treats them as full games. Changing the
<br>scoring is one way to address that defect. I will grant that all proposed
<br>solutions have problems. However, increased cheating in general
<br>is not one of them.
