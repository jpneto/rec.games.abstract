This is a game for any plural number of players.

The game consists of a number of rounds, that number being a multiple
of the number of players.
Each player takes turns being the offense player.

Before each round, draw an array of n-by-n dots (which correspond to
the vertices of a grid of (n-1)-by-(n-1) squares).

On each round, all players take turns drawing straight vertical or
horizontal line-segments from any dot to any other in the same row or
column such that no line-segments cross any previously drawn segments.
(But any line-segment may connect with a previously-drawn segment at a
dot.)

The round ends when the players have drawn m line-segments, where m is
a predetermined multiple of the number of players, and is picked by
agreement among the players -- and m is the same for every round.
Note: m should be &lt; n^2 - 2n + 4 = (n-1)^2 +3, which is the minimum
number of segments needed to connect every dot to each of its
orthogonal neighbors. (That this is the minimum number of segments is
simply proved; and proving this may be a fun exercise for your
amusement, if you don't want too hard a puzzle.)

After m line-segments are drawn, the offense player for the round
receives a point for every dot connected to by 3 or 4 line-segments.
(For the purpose of counting points, a single line-segment drawn by a
player on a move and passing through -- and not terminating at-- a dot
counts as 2 "line-segments" meeting at that dot.)

Players add up the points they received on the rounds that each was
offense, and the highest total score wins.


Thanks,
Leroy Quet

PS: If this game is played on a rectangular array of j by k dots, the
minimum number of straight horizontal and vertical line-segments (each
of any length) needed to connect every dot to its orthogonal
neighbors, without any line-segments crossing, is:
j*k - k - j + 4, or so I think.

I forgot an important rule:

No line-segment may coincide with any previously drawn segment.
