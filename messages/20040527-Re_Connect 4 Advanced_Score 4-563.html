Yes, I was asking about Score 4.

Rather then a program, I was looking for some advice on playing. For
instance, is making multiple threats the key? Do you have to count, as in
Connect 4, the number of moves remaining to know if you can force the
opponent to play in that column he doesn't want to, etc.

The closest thing to a 3-D version of Connect 4 is the game sold as
"Score Four".  Unlike 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe, the markers (beads) played in
Score Four drop down to the base/bead beneath them.  This makes the game
similar to Connect 4, in which the checkers also drop down.  I have
found Score Four to be much more interesting to play than 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe.

Since there are at most 16 possible moves in Score-Four, of which only
about 4 to 8 are "good moves", it should not be hard to get a computer
program to play an almost unbeatable game by using a standard min-max
strategy with alpha-beta pruning.
