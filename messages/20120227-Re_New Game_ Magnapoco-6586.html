This one's for Corey, who's been on me to post some of my unpublished
designs. I designed this one with him in mind.

This looks like a beautiful and original game. I think I understand
its strategical dilemma: you'd want to create as few groups as
possible so that the smallest of them is as big as possible, but you
shouldn't create too few of them, or you'll be more likely forced to
join them all in a single group later in the game and lose. If the
game works as expected, finding the right balance between these two
extremes could be an exciting challenge.

However, I don't like the fact that the game starts from a fixed
position, and I think this is actually unnecessary. Instead, I suggest
starting from an empty board and stating the winning condition as
follows:

"When the board is full, the player whose smallest group is biggest
wins, unless it's his only group on the board, in which case he loses.
In case of a tie, etc."

With the current rules, the event of having only one group at the end
of your turn will only occur if you can't create any additional groups
after joining them all. This already requires a practically full
board, so it doesn't seem apropriate to make the "one group loses"
rule a sudden death condition which introduces the need for a starting
set-up. With my suggested rule, I'd say players will have more than
enough incentive to create more than one group from the very
beginning. Otherwise, his second group will have reduced growth
potential when it's finally created.

But I haven't actually played the game yet, so I may be missing some
crucial point here.
