Makes more sense now. Simple rules. Should be an interesting tactical quickie.

My problem is how to phrase the rules.
English is NOT my mother tongue.
This game "scratch it" is in fact designed to be played in larger board with new rules + new sets + new board.
I have lot of new mechanics.
Each time I present only the basic mechanics.
Anyway there are lot of games to come...
I published less than 5% of all my games.
I could flood BGG abstract forums.
Each day I could 5 to 6 games during one year!!! 
I`m not making this up.
I know what I`m talking about.
I`m going to surprise you mister Luis : your game Ayu I invented it before you. That is why I knew the game will succeed. My version is simplier than your game (one rule : move and swap) but the goal was different. I called the game : Concentration. My setup is different.
Your game will be at the top if you simplify the rules by changing your setup.
Good luck to you.
