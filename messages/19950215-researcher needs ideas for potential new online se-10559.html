Greetings.  I am looking for some feedback on games
by the people who play them.  I am doing research for
a bunch of guys who want to start their own business.
I would appreciate email. Thanks in advance.  They
want to know the following.

l. what games including tv shows or tv games present or past would
you like to see on an online service.

2. what do you like or dislike about the games currently available?

Your feedback is very much appreciated.
Regards,
Joyce
