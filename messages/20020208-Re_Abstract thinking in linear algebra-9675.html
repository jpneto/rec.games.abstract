The easiest argument is aimed at those who believe that intelligence exists, is
measurable, and that IQ is at least a reasonable facsimile to the true

There is a positive correlation.  But there is even more evidence
that intelligence is multidimensional, and that people can do well
in one area without doing well in another.

There is also evidence that continual work is very bad
for the bright, and that drill after moderate mastery is
almost completely counterproductive.  If we could do it,
I would like to remove anyone who would consider giving
someone who understands something routine problems from
education entirely.

At best, it is that those who CAN do well at a calculus
course which emphasizes understanding and downplays
manipulation can also do well at abstract mathematics, but
this is not necessary, and there are those who can do well
at abstract ideas, not tested by intelligence tests, and
poorly tested at best, but who do nowhere near as well at
routine manipulation.

Also, the converse direction holds.  Those who could
understand abstract mathematics could teach children those
concepts in the "new math", but the teachers were totally
unable to handle them.

Probably more realistically, few students can get through the whole calculus

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Those who can understand it SHOULD get through the whole
sequence with VERY little work.  And they should get a
full-blown real analysis course instead, with calculus
as an application.  Who needs to know how to calculate
derivatives and anti-derivatives?  Only theoreticians 
need this; the one applying it can use tools.  But we
have many examples of excellent mathematicians who have
difficulty with such manipulations.

Understanding needs to precede manipulation, or only 
the extremely bright can understand it.  Yes, the geniuses
can understand mathematics after manipulation, if they are
not driven off by the boredom, and if they are not also
driven out for low grades due to not handing in busy work.

But why subject them to the junk?  Even the moderately
good ones can learn mathematics faster without it, and
then learn the manipulative material twice as fast, 
because they will understand what they are doing.

 	So we (pretty much) require students to show
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
they can do at least a little work before allowing them to take a math course
that will require them to think.  (Have to work before you can think?)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is exactly the opposite.  We can teach abstract 
mathematics, involving thinking, to children who can
just read.  Every year in the present schools serves
to stultify the innate ability to think abstractly.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And I doubt that abstract reasoning is inhibited by computation.  Children (and
adults too, for that matter) are pretty resilient.  It takes lots and lots of
bad teaching to undo our natural desires.  And very, very lots to completely
bury them.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Teaching reading by the whole word method, besides wasting
years, seems to have reduced or even destroyed the ability
of a substantial proportion of children to use the alphabet
to pronounce words.

The schools provide almost completely bad teaching; one
can teach elementary school children about the integers
from first principles, but after being told that the
integers are learned by memorizing methods of computing
sums and products, it is a major problem.  Preschoolers
understand grammatical structure; college students 
usually do not.

And keeping a child who can learn more in a dumbed-down
class cannot have any good effect whatever.

Those who can think abstractly, and I believe that this
is most, are born that way.  It can be knocked out.
