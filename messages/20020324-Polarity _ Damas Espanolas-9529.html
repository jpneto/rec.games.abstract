Hello,

Polarity

   strong advantage

Interesting.  The strong first player advantage didn't come out during play
testing.  I'd like to hear more.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I tested the game a long time ago and couldn't exactly remember why I made
the note: "Enormer Anzugsvorteil!" ("enormous advantage for the first
player") in my folder "Damevarianten und andere Schlagspiele" ("draughts
variants and other capture games").

I checked the game again and came to the following result:

Polarity is a sure win for the first player. The game is flawed.

Reasons:

It's easier to get rid of your negative pieces than to capture your
opponent's positive pieces, because the opponent can much easier defend
his positive pieces than he can defend against an attacking negative
piece. For this reason, White's strategy should be to win by losing all
his negative pieces first. Now look at the starting position which is very
unfair to Black:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/polarity.html">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/polarity.html</a>

White (Lower Side) has two groups of negative stones, wheras Black (Upper
Side) has four groups. Even worse, two of Black's groups of negative
pieces are blockaded by his positive pieces, wheras none of White's
negative groups are blockaded. This means, that White can easily move his
negative stones towards Black, where they are captured and he can also
much more effectively use sacrifice techniques than Black can do.

This solution is rather trivial and easy to find.

BTW, I doubt that you really use all the rules of Damas Espanolas as it
is claimed by Zillions ("Other than this, the game follows the
rules of Spanish Checkers"). According to the Federacion de Damas
Espanolas Clasicas there is the following rule:

"In the event of two branches of capture (same number of pieces), it is
compulsory to jump over that with the maximum number of powerful pieces
(kings) This is called the Rule of Quality."
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.terra.es/personal2/jlgsanz/checkers/rules.htm">http://www.terra.es/personal2/jlgsanz/checkers/rules.htm</a>

See the Spanish description for the complete rules:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.terra.es/personal2/jlgsanz/damas/reglas.htm">http://www.terra.es/personal2/jlgsanz/damas/reglas.htm</a>

However, whether you use the "quality capture rule" in Polarity or
not doesn't make any difference in the strategical solution I outlined
above.

Note:
Spanish Checkers has always been described with wrong rules by
US Americans. Probably this is because you still confuse Metric and
Imperial measures ;-)
