But if you randomize who moves first in the second phase, that advantage
mostly disappears. The person who goes last in the first phase theoretically
still decides whether the initial position is winnable, but since he doesn't
know who will go first, he might as well try to make it interesting.

Players then take turns; on each turn a player rewrites the list with
one of these changes:
Either:
The player changes one integer in the list to a product of any number
of PROPER divisors, each divisor greater than 1, that all multiply to
that integer. (The divisors must be placed between the same integers
in the list as the integer they replaced, but they can be in any order
amongst themselves between those integers.)
Or:
The player replaces two adjacent integers in the list with their sum.

it replaces.)

In your example you have allowed a 1 in the initial list. It's not clear
whether you'd consider 1 to be a prime for purposes of game termination.. I
think you should... the idea that you can get a list of just primes and 1's
and still make an addition move feels wrong. (Note: a 1 will never appear in
the list except if it was there from the beginning).

No, that wasn't it. Player 2 should have said "2 6 2 10". But player 1 still

Player 1 missed the win again. "8 10 2" would have done it. Player 2 gets

How does "combining and dividing" start if the numbers chosen to begin
the game is: (5, 7)?

Is player 2 declared the winner because player 1 doesn't get a chance
to do any work that will cause him "get" a list completely of primes
or "combining and dividing" would start anyway and thus player 1 would
be forced to combine two numbers into one in his first move?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Realized after posting that it doesn't matter. Player 2 wins in both
cases.
