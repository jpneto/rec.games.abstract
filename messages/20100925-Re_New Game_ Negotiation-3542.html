You are right, that possibility could arise. But it looks like this
isn't a problem in Ecalper.

This is my opinion (and also opinions of other players), but if you
will play Ecalper you could tell me more about your feedback. I'm
really interested to listen it.  :-)

Finding a good name it was difficult (I have a problem to understand
how a name sounds in english), and I have found that backwards-spelled
name was quite good for me. So I did choose to stop my searching.
