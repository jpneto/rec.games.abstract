Well, I'm not.  But there do seem to be a lot of matches decided in

This is irrelevant to a discussion of the effect of scoring three
points for a win, since such scoring is only used in leagues and extra
time is only used in knock-out competitions.

The fundamental mystery of chess is why such a popular game has so
little attention paid to its best players.  The answer, I think, is
that the best players are playing in competitions in which
draw-producing play and strategies based on drawing rule.

I think you think wrong.  I think the reason is that no-one outside
the top players understands well enough in real time what is going
on.  [...]  Try that with chess.  It's like watching paint dry,
until there is a time scramble.  Only expert players have any idea
at all what is happening.  Many games are resigned when a club
player would still have no idea what is happening.  I can play
through a game between [say] Anand and Kramnik, but the only way to
understand what has happened is to have annotations, preferably
provided by the players themselves, constructed hours or days after
the game has happened.  There have been valiant attempts -- the BBC
had excellent coverage of the Kasparov-Short match, for example --
but they really can't compete with live coverage of football, golf,
cricket, ....  You would get more "action" from 5-minute chess, but
then you would have even fewer prospects of getting any appreciation
of what is happening in real time.  Chess is to be played, not
watched.

I agree wholeheartedly, though I'd add `and studied' before the final
comma.
