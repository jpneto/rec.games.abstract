See you later, have fun. Here it's also still fairly nice and warm,

Back now  :)  Christian, I'm glad one of us is "hot" right now.  Someone has
to keep the fire burning, and it might as well be you.  Look's like the
floor is all yours  :)  Once again, welcome to the group.

That was a tough bike ride.  Tonight I'll treat myself to a two hour massage
with a lovely, ape strong Chinese lady.  When she laughs, you laugh.   There
is no spoken dialogue beyond "Hava You".  Her gauge is a simple one. 
Smiling face - green light.  Free flowing tears - yellow light.  Still
conscious and gasping for breath - "in the zone".

Bill's reading this and getting excited.  I've asked the police to be on the
lookout for a fat transient in a grubby T-shirt with "I AM GOD" magic
markered all over it, endlessly muttering "Mark Steere must be stopped. 
Mark Steere must be stopped..." in a thick New Zealand accent.
