If you find that offensive, perhaps you shouldn't have turned up on
Hexwiki like you did, apparently thinking your more general game was
Big News and should instantly be recognized as <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> generalization of
Hex.

So you mean MN isn't a generalization because it has a mechanism (a
Hex mechanism, even) for combining the games it encompasses? I think
that is nitpicking, to use a moderate word, but you must at least
agree that all the subgames of MN beginning at move 2 constitute a
generalization of Hex.

Atoll may still be a good game, but your generalization isn't the only
one, or even the first one.
