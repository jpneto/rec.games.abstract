 Actually I don't need to play the 4x4 game at all!

I don't know why I didn't see it straight off,
but there's a much simpler way to prove the point.

Just look at the 2x2 board!

Vertical has an obvious win, even when Horizontal moves first!
It doesn't even matter who owns the diagonal directions here!

|    h    v
|       -    -

Here are the first 2 moves, Vert just plays in
the same row as Horiz.   Now whatEVER else happens,
Vert will win!              Q.E.D

This simultaneously shows:

1:  In "Torus" Vert and Horiz are unequally tasked;
2:  Steere's alleged "proof" that they're equivalent is nonsense;
3:  Steere is a complete idiot.

Bye all.
