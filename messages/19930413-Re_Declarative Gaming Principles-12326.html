This was more what I thought when I saw the topic line of this
discussion. Procedural (or imperative) programming languages describe
how to reach a goal by consecutive modifications to a state. This is
indeed similar to most games, where you move, change, place or remove
pieces on a board or lines on a bit of paper (or in Nomic, a set of
rules). Declarative languages describe a relation or function between
the input and output without specifying any sequence other than that
imposed by data-dependence, nor any implementation-independent concept
of "state".

Yes, unspecified sequence of actions and reactions are one big thing. Another
is the introduction of new relations and the definition of new objects by
specifying the relations between the new object and the old ones. Although
it is possible to do this in a procedural language, it is much easier in a
declarative one, because procedural languages/procedural games usually don't
say anything about events 'outside' the system. You cannot move pieces off
the board, for instance, and there is no rule in most wargames to change
the capabilities of units. In a declarative game there is no 'Outside',
the domain of the game is what the players define it to be. If something pops
up that has no relation to anything and generally appears to be totally out
of the domain, you can simply resolve this problem by stating that it is
wrong or not provable. This is a big difference to being illegal in a rules-
sense. When in a procedural game something illegal crops up, an exception
occurs, in a declarative game some kind of proof strategy may fail, which
however is a perfectly 'legal' part of the game.

I'll make up a pretty good example for a declarative game (someone gave me
a good idea today) and when any interest shows on this group I will post it.
It may, however, become somewhat lengthy...

Uli.

What makes a game is the ability to choose. In "procedural" games, you
normally have choices as a state develops, e.g. at every move. But you
can also have games where you only specify an initial condition and
then just resolve the outcome. This in itself does not make a game
declarative - CoreWars is an example of a procedural game where the
state is changed at every turn, but where players only specify an
initial state and then watch for developments.

Purely declarative games are games like the one played recently on the
net, where each contestant choose a number, and the smallest unique
number is the winner. This game is a bit too simplistic to interest a
lot of people in the long run, but the idea is there: only the initial
configuration determines the outcome, and no "intermediate" states are
needed to resolve the game.
