Nice to see people are playing Capablanca Chess.... 
But for those who want to have the chancellor and cardinal around, there's
a much better alternative: Grand Chess!

Grand Chess (by Christiaan Freeling) is played on a 10x10 board; rules are
as in (regular) Chess, except as follows:

- Castling does not exist (since the rooks have little difficulty in getting
  developed, being connected on the back rank from the start)
- A pawn may only be promoted to a piece already lost by its side.
- Pawns may promote upon <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>entering<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the 8th, 9th or 10th rank, at its owner's
  option. Upon moving to the 10th rank promotion is compulsory (so, if no piece
  is lost by its side, it may not move onto the 10th rank, although it still
  attacks (gives check to) an enemy king on that rank.

In Grand Chess, you'll have no problems in developing the rooks, and the 
pawn ranks are still just four squares apart. Wayne Schmittberger compares
Capablanca's Chess and Grand Chess as follows: "...Freeling's opening setup,
I believe, yields the better game." 



Grand Chess and many other games are covered in Wayne Schmittberger's book:
