hi,

We are about to release a Public Domain version of the board game Ishido.
We first saw this game on an Atari Lynx game console. The game is played
on a 12x8 board. You start with a pouch of 72 pieces. Each piece has a colour
and a symbol. There are 6 colours and 6 symbols, so 36 different pieces. 
You have two of each, making 72 total. The player take 6 stones out and puts
them on the board (1 in every corner, 2 in the middle:

     x..........x
     ............
     ............
     .....x......
     ......x.....
     ............
     ............
     x..........x    )

Now the game starts. The player takes one piece out of the pouch and the object
is place it on the board. There are rules:

the piece should touch at least one other piece,

if it touches only one other: it should have the same colour OR the same symbol

if it touches 2 others: it should have the same colour as one, the same symbol
                        as the other

if it touches 3 others: it should have the same colour as 2, the same symbol as
                        the third, OR it should have the same symbol as 2, the
                        same symbol as the third

if it touches 4 others: it should have the same color as 2, same symbol of 2
                        others, AND in addition the two pieces which share
                        the colour of the current piece should be 'close'.

The player wins if s/he manages to place all 72 pieces on the board.
example:

ab stands for 'a piece with colour a and symbol b'

ab may be placed in square x but not on square y:


       ac
    ad x  db
       eb


       db
    ad y  ac
       eb

Rules may sound difficult but are in fact quite easy.

Now our question: does anybody know this game? the background of this game?
know where it comes from? We would like to add some background history to
our .doc file!
