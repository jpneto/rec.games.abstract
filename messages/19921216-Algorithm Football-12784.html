This reminds me of a game I played in college called Algorithm
Football(*).  Three to bignum people sit in a circle and toss a
football(**) around.  One person in the circle has an algorithm --
whenever the ball goes to him, his algorithm tells him who to throw
the ball to next.  The other players try to figure out the algorithm.
No pencil and paper allowed.  Throwing the ball to yourself is legal,
and may be required by the algorithm.  Whoever figures the algorithm
out first (you don't need the ball to announce) gets to make up the
next algorithm, and so on.

Two restrictions.  The algorithm player had to be able to follow the
algorithm correctly (honor system!) in less than ten seconds.  The
algorithm could only depend on the path of the ball through the
players -- you weren't allowed to take into account things like who
spoke last or who held the ball the longest.

A typical algorithm might be "On even turns, throw the ball to
&lt;player&gt;.  On odd turns, throw the ball to the person n+1 steps to my
right, not counting myself or &lt;player&gt;, where n is the number of times
&lt;player&gt; caught the ball since I threw it last."

(*) Not to be confused with John Conway's excellent game Philosopher's
Football, aka Phutball.  See <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> for details.

(**) or koosh ball or pillow or any other throwable object(***).  Of
course, then the name of the game is Algorithm Koosh Ball, Algorithm
Pillow, or Algorithm Any Other Throwable Object, respectively.

(***) I do not recommend Algorithm Shiruken.
