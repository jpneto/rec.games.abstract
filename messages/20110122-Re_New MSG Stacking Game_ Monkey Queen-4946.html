It occurred to me that babyrooks would be speedy

That was actually the first thing I considered, almost.  I wanted to use
bishops, thinking that queens would cause a huge problem with first move
advantage and with lack of clarity.  But I tried the queens to see how
fucked up it would be, and it wasn't fucked up at all.  It was supremely
playable.

Don't take my queens away.  The only reason I wouldn't use them is if they
were causing a problem, and they aren't.  With the pie rule, I'm sure we
could figure out some first moves shitty enough on an 8x8 board that Player
2 wouldn't invoke the pie rule.

I don't like to make major structural changes to my games.  I changed the
baby kings to baby queens in response to four suggested improvements, the
common subtext being that Monkey Queen could be made a little more exciting.

Now I've got something that works, and works well.  The 8x8 to 10x10 is
cosmetic.  MQ is scalable and presumed to be playable at various sizes.  I'm
just saying, "Beginners, don't play ten games on the 8x8 and then wish it
was a 10x10.  Just start with the 10x10."  Usually programmers want one
representative board size.  That size would be 10x10 for Monkey Queen.

On a general note: leaving the whole stack idea in favor
of a king spawning an army of its own pieces, a limited
number but of a diverse composition, might hold a game
or two too.

Monkey Queen certainly does present an interesting new mechanism for placing
the initial playing pieces of a game - one that certainly could be
generalized.  When they're all Chess queens, they cover each other in a way
that if any one of them gets killed, the death can be avenged.

On that note though, I've barely pulled the baby queen out of the birth
canal and spanked its butt.  Let's give it a chance to acclimate before
spawning more monkey siblings.   MQ v1 had to fend off four monkey attacks
in the first week of its existence.  Let's not get monkey fever over MQ v2
now.

I'm almost tempted, but for the fact that chesslike systems
usually require arbitrary  choices. And at the moment my
mind is not exactly welcoming the thought of that.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Monkey Queen's design certainly had arbitrary choices, as evidenced by the
change from baby kings to baby queens.  But there's an axiom at the heart of
MQ - one which generates a finite game with lots of freedom and variety of
movement.  It's not like Breakthrough (Dan Troyka) where you're marching
pawns from this side to that side.

In Monkey Queen you're moving babies closer to an enemy queen which can
suddenly move somewhere else, causing your babies to change direction and
follow it.  This can't go on indefinitely because the queen is allowed only
a finite number of non-capturing moves.  Lovely.  I call Monkey Queen my
first game-centric design, but its architecture is magnificent.
