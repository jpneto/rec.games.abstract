For my Ph.D thesis, I have investigated (the literature on) a large
number of strategic games. For most games I have been able to obtain
all the information I need, except for Chinese Chess, Scrabble and Bridge.

I would appreciate any pointers to information regarding the following;

1. The state-of-the-art in Chinese Chess, including an estimate of the
   rating of the strongest program with respect to human players.
   Which programs are currently considered best?
2. The state-of-the-art in Scrabble. Here I have heard rumors both that
   the strongest programs outperform human players, as well as rumors that
   the strongest humans still have the edge.
   Which programs are currently considered to be the best.
3. Bridge: which programs are regarded as being the best today. I know
   about Bridge Baron and Bridge King from computer olympiads, but are they
   the best around?

Any help is greatly appriciated,

Victor Allis.
