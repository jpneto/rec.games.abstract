Of all the infinite possible themes for the next contest, I really think we
could come up with something a little more cheerful than suicide, if we put
a little effort into it.  Keep in mind, this is a winter contest, the idea
being that more people have more time for abstract games when they're snowed
in, a fact borne out by attendance statistics at the various game sites. 
But winter is also a time of seasonal depression for many of us.  Let's find
a more cheerful theme.  Misere games generally suck anyway, so I don't think
we'll be sacrificing too much in abandoning this grim whim.
