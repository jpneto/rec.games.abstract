What can you folks tell me about sources of fiction written about Chess
and texts on Fairy Chess?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The best (okay, only) chess-based fiction I have ever read is a splendid
book by John Brunner titled <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Squares of the City<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, written some time in
the '60s.  In the foreword, Brunner says that the book is based on a game
that was actually played (I forget by whom and when) and has been published
in the literature, although the game itself is not included in the book.  A
truly intriguing read, with the protagonist involved in a larger-than-life
'chess game' between two political leaders in a fictional South American
country.  Highly recommended to chess maniacs and chessphobes alike.  (Look
in the sci-fi section of your favourite used bookstore - the book isn't,
but Brunner is for some reason classified as a sci-fi author...)
