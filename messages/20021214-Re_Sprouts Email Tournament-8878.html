This is just one approach to computer game playing.  It's the most
successful, for certain well-known games such as chess, but it's
certainly not the only possible approach nor the only approach that has
been implemented and used.

Well, no, I did not mean to imply that there could not be other
approaches to playing chess.  I just wish I could find an approach
that would make me a chess master, but I don't believe that's going to
happen.  By the way, I recently invented a chess variant which is
played exactly like standard chess, except that the chessmen are
allowed to move backwards in time.  The description is at
