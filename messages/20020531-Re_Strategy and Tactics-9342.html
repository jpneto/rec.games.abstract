But see, you're still making reference to individual units in most of those
examples. The fact that you don't actually name them (like VI Corps or
something) doesn't matter. Also, securing supply lines is clearly strategic.
How you go about it (where to place your garrison units) is a tactical
decision. Flanking an enemy could be either: are you talking an enemy unit
(tactics) or army (strategy)? "Attacking when you have a tactical
advantage": clearly a strategy. It can apply to any number of situations all
across a game. Just because tactics ultimately implement strategies does not
mean the strategies aren't strategies, if you follow me.

But I agree there are still problems with my definition. I think one of the
best ways to answer this question is with common sense. I mean, think about
what you would say when commenting on a certain play or style of play. Would
you say, "that's a great (or lousy) TACTIC, or STRATEGY"?? Honest Abe said
that common sense ain't so common, but I think that's at least partially
true because we tend to over-analyze things and get into a "paralysis by
analysis" mode. Simple fact is, 99% of gamers have an innate understanding
of the differences btw tactics and strategy, even if they can't articulate
them.

But this discussion could go on for days nevertheless :-)

Well, it's a start... Let's try this another way.

-Avoid entering enemy units ZOC's during movement.
 That's without reference specific individual units, but it has such a
 strong tactical element to it, I hesitate to label it strategy.

-Attack units when you have a tactical advantage.
 Strategy or tactics?

-Actually attacking a unit in the open with one under cover (terrain
advantage).
 Tactical decision or strategic?

-Securing supply lines

-Flanking an enemy

I started this after watching an argument in comp.ai.games
on whether chess or Age of Empires has more `tactical depth'.
From the programming standpoint, chess responds well to
alpha-beta searches, I imagine AoE is driven by a general
rule based system. That could be seen as encouragement that
chess places responds better to tactical analysis than AoE
at the very least. I de-lurked briefly to see if terms could
be defined but the post was mostly ignored.
