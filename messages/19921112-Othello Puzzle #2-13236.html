Due to the interest in Othello Puzzle #1, I've decided to make it a
semi-regular feature.  In future I'll include a coordinate system, to
make analysis easier.  White is well ahead in the position no matter
what, but I think b2 is the most decisive win (perhaps somebody with
a computer will want to check this assertion).  To recall, the
proposition was:

 Othello Puzzle #1:

  a b c d e f g h
1 . o o o . x . .
2 . . o x o x . .
3 . x x o x o x .
4 x x x x x x x .
5 x x x x o x o o
6 x x o o x o o .
7 x . x o o x . .
8 . x x x x x x . 

After a move to b2, black is helpless.  In fact, his best response might be
to play g7 immediately, at least ensuring access to the a1 corner, and
the top edge.  With almost no real options, black will collapse and white
will end up with most of the rest of the board.

Puzzle #2 is considerably more difficult, so be patient and play out
sequences to make sure you don't miss anything.  Again, it's white to
play and win decisively.  I should add the disclaimer that there may
well be several moves which lead to equally clear wins.  If so, I'd be
happy to discuss others people might come up with!  These positions are
from actual games, and in actual games there is rarely one "best" move,
rather several similar moves.  I have tried to stick to positions in which
the line I've thought of is devastating, but it might not be unique ...
Have fun with it!

White (o) to play and win decisively ... where would YOU play??
