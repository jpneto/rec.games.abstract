It's my conviction that it's morally wrong to compare humans with machines,

Wow.  So if I said something like, "Jews are bigger than flies," you'd
consider it immoral?  You must have a very strict moral sense.

In my opinion, there's nothing morally wrong with comparing humans with
machines.  It would probably be morally wrong to set unreasonable 
expectations regarding humans and machines, but comparisons are mere 
statements of fact and I don't consider them to have morality values.

It is presposterous to compare our

A: "Hey, I've built a robot that jumps!"
B: "Really?  Can it jump this high?" &lt;jumps&gt;
A: "Wow, how rude you are, suggesting the possibility of me 
 comparing my robot's jumping abilities to that of you, a human!
 That is immoral and preposterous!  Get out of my lab; I never 
 want to talk to you again!"

I think that it's not really the comparison between humans and machines
that is bothering you, but rather some implicit expectation that
humans will never beat machines (or vice versa).
