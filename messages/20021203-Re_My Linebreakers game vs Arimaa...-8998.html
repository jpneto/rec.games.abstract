I had a look at the ZoG zrf file, it just contains the rules and

ZoG user so I may have overlooked something.

Well, here's the problem as I see it (and I admit well in advance that I
haven't got a clue, really):  Mr. Syed did not code the Zillions engine,
therefore he is not in a position to NECESSARILY best exploit the power of
the engine.  It's a bad example, but if you read his comments (and bear in
mind at all times that I admire the man and the game and the challenge) you
will see that he was not able to implement the "draw" processing of his own
game in Zillions.  I deserve 10 bucks just for spending the last 2 or 3
hours trying to do it myself.  For all those who try, you can skip using the
(verify (piece? allset game-state)) test anywhere inside the draw-condition
syntax--you can, quite amusingly use (pieces-remaining 0 Rabbit) as a
draw-condition test, which presumably only tests against the player who last
moved, but the engine tests this immediately, prior to any rabbits having
been dropped, and decides that there are no valid moves (which seems
reasonable).  I can imagine Mr. Syed scratching his head a few times during
the coding of his ZRF file.

But anyway, the point is that since the Zillions developers themselves have
developed the "AI" behind their engine, it should be up to them to format
the rules that engine follows in playing the game.  Mr. Syed really can't be
expected to write the optimal ruleset, if not for reasons of personal bias,
then for reasons of expertise.  Was that clear?  It's 4:30 a.m. here, and
I've been screwing around with Zillions for hours.....
