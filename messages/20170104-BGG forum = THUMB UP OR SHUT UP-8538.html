Either you thumb up or you shut up.
Here are the facts about Slither :

Number of played games	542
Average duration	47m 35s
Number of wins by the 1st player (excluding quits)	259 (49.05%)
Number of wins by the 2nd player (excluding quits)	269 (50.95%)


Members, who played at least 1 game	169
Members, who played at least 10 games	23

So during 7 years (2555 days) the game was played 842 times (50% where played by the designer Corey). Only 23 played it more than 10 times.
I posted my opinion. Result : Suspended 7 days!!!

Moderators are just acting like dictators : you can not thumb down!!! Either you say Heil Hitler long live to Kim Jung or long live to Mobutu or you shut up.

When someone thumb up a game he did not play test it destroys any credibility on the forum. Thumbing up a crappy game or crappy designer is like throwing shit on my face.

I do not care about been banished as long as I could say the truth.
