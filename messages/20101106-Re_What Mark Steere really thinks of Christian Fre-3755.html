Your new job is to make  games and post them here and fuck off the other 364 days of the year.

Jackspritz, I don't know who you are, but I posted a game in Nick
Bentley's thread. I don't attack people, and I try to stick to a
threads subject. Yet many comments are personal attacks, and you even
admit to derailing threads only because Mark posts in them. Do you
think that's fair to me or others? Or do all posters agree with your
mission?

You got that right, this place is a mess! Anyway, I'm going to
continue to spam, derail threads and troll the hell out of this place
until it has the integrity of a moldy popsicle stick, don't worry
about that. I think it's perfectly fair. Many of us agree that this
site is dead and rightfully blame Steere for that and now it's like he
thinks he's done something wonderful, dragging you in here. This place
couldn't be more undeserving of your attention if it were a group for
foot fetishists for christ sakes. I happily admit to derailing threads
on mark.steere.opinions. Everyone's moved on to bigger and brighter
things.

Jackspritz, I don't feel 'baited and patronized' by Mark, but I feel
much of the energy here is totally misdirected. What must I do to
blend in? Rant? Attack people personally?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Just get out of this goofy place, that's what. This isn't a forum for
abstract games, it's where a tired old man goes to air his grievances
on a biweekly basis. It's bullshit of the worst sort.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But has anyone actually commented on the game? I'm very sorry, but I
don't think posts here are very fruitful.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, and most wont either. We've moved elsewhere.
