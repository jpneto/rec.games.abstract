Mark if being true to one's self in your case means being a hotheaded
cunt, then go be yourself elsewhere. Don't call it courageous to be an
asshole, it's not, it's just annoying. Calling some guy who says he
doesn't care about superko in Arimaa a retard is not courageous.
Ranting about your ex Ralf Gering and how poorly he preformed in bed
years after your sober self doesn't care anymore isn't courageous
either. You're not courageous asshole. You're just a guy who gets lost
in the pot haze that ceaselessly haunts his house. Nobody gets to be
courageous on the internet. The most you can hope for is that people
wont think you're a complete shit head. You failed on that front. Even
if you weren't such a prick, you still wouldn't be courageous. All
you're doing is poking at some keys, in your case haphazardly, and
moving an arrow around. Yeah, courage that's what comes to mind when I
look at Mark Steere... <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/pictures/mark_super_lariat.jpg">http://www.marksteeregames.com/pictures/mark_super_lariat.jpg</a>
