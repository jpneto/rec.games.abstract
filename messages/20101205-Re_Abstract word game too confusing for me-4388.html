We really should end this squabbling, Clark.  This is stupid.  You should be
in the Oust thread, commenting on Raza's tutorial, not avoiding Oust and
being "belligerent and immature".

Christian has made it crystal clear that he isn't joining your fudge pact,
Corey.  Ok?  I think we can all see that now, even you.  And Christian is
the only poster one who really matters as far as I'm concerned.  I encourage
anyone so inclined to join Corey's fudge pact to do so.  Mike, please join
Corey's fudge pact so he can shut up about it for ten minutes.

There. Settled.  If there's any remaining beef, I apologize in advance,
because I'm not aware of it.
