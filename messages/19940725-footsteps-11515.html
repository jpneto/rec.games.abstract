About four months ago, we were discussing the game "footsteps", which I
think of as an idealized tug-of-war game.  (One-dimensional board with a
single token on it; each turn, each of the two players decides how much of
his personal energy supply to expend; the one who picks the larger value
pulls the token one space; whoever pulls the token off the board wins.)

I was analyzing the simplest nontrivial board: only two spaces, so that
one player needs only one turn to win, and the other needs two.  I let the
computer grind through the lowest values of the discrete game (where the
players must select a positive integer), but I was more interested in the
continuous game, or equivalently, the limit of the discrete game as the
energy supply tends to infinity.  I conjectured that if the player 1 has
the positional advantage and has M units of energy, and player 2 has N,
then the game value is -1 \/ 3-(2N/M) /\ +1.  (\/ and /\ are infix max and
min operators.)

I've encountered further evidence in favor of this conjecture, and if it's
true, then I've found an optimal strategy for both players in the case
N/M &gt;= 3/2.  The case N/M &lt; 3/2 seems to be harder; I haven't had time to
investigate it very thoroughly.

A tentative conjecture for the 3-space board with the token in the middle
is that the game value is -1 \/ 3(M-N)/(M+N) /\ +1.  I don't have a guess
for the general case yet.
