You and Luis are deeply dishonest to recognize that you stole the idea from me.
Not surprising at all! 
But always keep in mind that I`m the only game designer who could create 1000 games in one year all original and different.
I did not publish almost 90% of my works.
I designed a software able to produce 10000000000000000000000000 abstract games.
I`m not programmer but the day I finish it I will pay a team of programmers to implement it.
You and all the crappy game designers of BGG will be flooded by a tsunami of elegant, simple and original games (tested checked without any "bug").
