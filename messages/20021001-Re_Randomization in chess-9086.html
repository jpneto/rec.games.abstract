To me, this does not make sense. If you are able to determine the best
move, naturally you will play the best move, independently of if your
opponent is playing bad moves? Many game programs search to a differnt
depth depending on how promising line looks. This is the same as
assigning a weight to each move of how good it looks, although it does
not take in account how likely it is that your opponent with make this
move. This takes in account both a shallow search for seemingly stupid
moves and a deep search for the moves that seem best. In a 2 player
game, ignoring certain moves that seem good because you think your
opponent will not make them seems pretty naive.

Well, it seems that I was somewhat misunderstood and possibly for good 
reason. At an advanced level of play, which is what we are really aiming 
for here, you would certainly be making the best moves you could find.
It just seemed to me that the computer may have to work "harder" at
lower levels of play...in order to account for all the bad moves that
may take the game in a different direction, adding more "trains of
thought to follow". In a higher level of play, these bad moves would
be less important to take into account, therefor freeing the computer
to focus on what would be considered expected moves by the person
playing. I was not trying to say that the good moves should be ignored,
just that the number of moves that might be "expected" would be greater
in lower levels of play since it would be less likely that the player
would find all the best moves. 

When seperating the levels of play into beginner, advanced and expert
or whatever the categories might be labeled, what do they do to limit
the abilty of the program to enable a player to have a better chance
at a lower level? It seems then, that certain bad moves must be selected
while sometimes overlooking or "ignoring" the best move in order
to give a beginner a sense of achievement. If this is the case, then
it would follow that all these bad moves and the lines that may follow
must then be prioritized to some degree. Also, the best moves would have 
to be prioritized when altering the most logical line of reason for a 
beginner level "decision". Which non-best move should be taken to give
the beginner a chance, but, not be an obvious stupid move?

This seems to me to be more information to deal with than following 
a select few relatively smart or expected lines of reason. Again the 
assumption here is that winning is not the only objective for the 
program at lower levels of play. It is really a tutorial approach 
which must be somewhat challenging without making the beginner feel 
too "stupid".

In any case, this may not be very important to the primary discussion
which had more to to do with fine tuning the fine tuned. I'm just
curious about tutorial approaches to games as well as the higher
level of play which is purely focused on the win.
