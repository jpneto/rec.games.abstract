For those who've never seen one, a mancala board is a narrow rectangle
with forteen holes in it -- a large one at either of the shorter ends
and two rows of six smallers ones.  (Are there variations on the
number of holes as well?)

Discussing the rules of the mancala games is something like discussing 
the rules of Cosmic Encounter: <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>everything<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> has an exception. There are 
well over one hundred mancala games documented in Lawrence Russ's 
(regretabley out-of-print) <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Mancala Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, and they have variants on 
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>every aspect of play<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (except I don't think you can call it a mancala 
game if the basic turn structure doesn't involve sowing seeds around the 
board). 

There are many mancalas with more than two rows; Christaan Freeling's 
"The Glass Bead Game" comes in variants from 2x6 down to 2x3; Avalon 
Hill's Oh-war-ree used a circular board, and I believe allowed the pits 
to be divided among four players.

A move consists of of removing all the stones from one of the six
normal holes on your side of the board, then, moving counterclockwise,
dropping one stone into each hole you encounter including your own,
but not your opponent's, mancala.  The move ends when you've dropped
all the stones.  If you end the move by dropping one in your mancala
you move again.  If you end the move by dropping the last stone in an
otherwise empty hole on your side of the board you collect all the
stones from the adjacent hole on your opponent's side; you place these
in your mancala.  That's it, the entire set of rules.

Well, no. The game you have described is Kalah (Kalakh?), and I can't 
remember exactly where it is most widely played. Most of the two-player 
mancalas I've seen have one important rule you've left out: If your 
opponent has no seeds on his side, you must make a play to leave seeds on 
his side. If this cannot be done, then the player with seeds captures all 
of them. 

I cannot remember for sure if Kalah has the following rule: If you circle
the board, you skip the first pit from which you sowed. Thus, only 12
seeds are required to circumnavigate. 

Recently, The Great American Trading Company published a very attractive, 
very inexpensive 2x6 wooden board with 48 colored glass beads as pieces. 
You should be able to find it at any good hobby or gift shop; if not, 
contact them directly at: 90 Willow Springs Circle, York PA 17402. (The 
rules included with the set are for Kalah, and also omit the "no seeds" 
rule.)
