SNAP!  I've been saying this for years, but my bridge-playing friends and
former cronies never seem to pay attention.  Somewhat like those who play
Go with Japanese (alleged-)rules.   

Now that I think on it, there's remarkably little overlap between keen
bridge players and keen CGT types!


|&gt; Bridge assumes a high level of ethics.

But does not expect it.  Hence the vast amount of rulage devoted to
"irregularities".  It's one of the few games that seems to expect its
players to cheat a lot.  (Of course they don't actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>call<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it cheating.)


|&gt; However, a partnership used to
|&gt; playing a bad but complicated set of conventions will have an unfair
|&gt; advantage over those who are not familiar with the proper defenses
|&gt; against those conventions.

Very true.  


|&gt; I would like to see at least
|&gt; some tournaments have no restrictions or alerts on the bidding

So would I!  Indeed, the only "exact" games of bridge can be those done
with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>no<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> communication between opponents, or between partners, except
as made by bids and play of cards.  No declarations of bidding or playing
conventions whatsoever.  Naturally, the individual players would have to
be playing in booths so no visual/aural clues were available.  There would
also have to be no clues from time delays to make bids/plays.  So all three
players' times would have to be individually unobservable by the other,
(and a small random time delay thrown in now and then would probably help!
In this computer age all this is fairly trivial to achieve, without the
rather ludicrous diagonal screens across the table.

It could be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>especially<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> amusing in "individual" competitions, which would
have to be arranged so that you never knew who your opponents or partner
were at <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> time!  For these, there would again have to be a standard 
simple set of announced conventions, (as they have now).  It would be fun!

Od course regular bridge players would (and do) object vociferously; for
one thing they couldn't deduce anything from their opponents' split-second
hesitations as they do now.  (Nor their partner's, as they don't admit to
doing now.)  Having undeclared and unknown conventions would be quite fun,
and would encourage more general bidding defenses.  It would, of course,
make the game a little less chess-like and a little more poker-like, but
hey, it's a card game anyway.   One big advantage this isolated-player
play would have, is avoiding the interminable appeals and controversies
that plague the game right now!

But for some reason, it's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exceptionally<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> rare to meet a keen brisdge player
who'll entertain such ideas even for a second!    It's quite irksome. 

Sigh...   Strokes and folks...
