Greetings and Salutations.  Does anyone know of a game called Wari?  I'm not
sure of the spelling.  The game involves seeds or marbles and usually two
players.  The playing board looks something like this:

     The object is to get the most seeds/marbles/? in your end bin by the
end of the game.  A move consists of taking all the seeds from one bin and
placing one in each bin there after until the player runs out of seeds from
that bin.  The player is able to go again if he/she ends up placing the last
seed in his/her large bin.  There is also some sort of way to "steal" the
other players seeds.

There are a lot of variations on this game.  One is that you capture all of the 
stones in the opposing opponents hole if your last stone drops in an empty hole 
on your side.  This also ends your turn.

Another rule is that you capture the stones in a hole if your last stone brings 
the hole count in that hole to two or three.  If this happens, you also capture 
all of the holes next to that one (i.e. into which you just dropped stones) 
which also have exactly two or three stones.

The game usually ends when one play has no remaining moves (all the holes on 
his side are empty).  There is usually a rule that you must play so as to give 
you opponent a move if possible.

There are several games books that describe this game and various variants.  
Names of the game include Wari, Oh-Wari and Mancala.
