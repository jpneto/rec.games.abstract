Yes, I've run into people that consider these games dry and boring (and
I guess I've even entertained that thought myself at times).  Still, if
we polled the world population and asked what the classiest game is,
I'll bet chess would be right up there.

Contrast that with backgammon, another age-old classic.  Popular
opinion seems to hold that it's a lesser game--probably because of the
dice.  Even bridge, though highly regarded, somehow lacks the class
that chess and go enjoy.

My perception of backgammon is that it is regarded as a classy game in
some circles. . . .
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, James Bond played backgammon in one of the movies, I think.
Probably one that came out in the 1970s, when backgammon enjoyed a
resurgence of popularity.

But in most places, I'd say backgammon is considered either a
borderline or outright gambling game.  And gambling games have a
curious place in the public mind, I think.  To many, they're
vulgar--but then there are those "high rollers" who find an ironic
classiness amidst the vulgarity.

Maybe I'm the only one who sees this phenomenon.  Am I just imagining
things, or do some kinds of games have a classier reputation than
others?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's very subjective, though, isn't it.  I don't see things like Gipf,
Hex and Dvonn in the same light.  My criteria are different to yours,
though in recognising a game as "classy" I don't necessarily recognise
it as good.  In recognising the game as good, I don't necessarily want
to play it, but that's another matter altogether.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is very subjective.  No doubt about that.

And as you suggest below, it's not even clear all the time in one's own
mind.  I find myself undergoing a fair amount of inner tension over
whether a given game is classy, whether it's good, and whether I like
to play it.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And while we're at it, which game do you think is the classiest--and
why?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Chess has to be the classiest game for me, though it's the one I least
want to play.  It generated so much literature, attracted so many
grandmasters, and players such as Caliph al-Mamun and Queen Elizabeth I,
that I can't help but recognise that it must have good reason for such
universal respect.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have to agree completely with that.  And besides what you've
mentioned, chess is one of the best-looking games in the world.  Some
people will buy an expensive chess set just to decorate a room, even if
they don't play.

And besides being so classy, I'd have to say that among abstract,
deterministic, perfect-information games, chess is the one I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>most<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
like to play.  It just has the right look and feel somehow, and the
right level of complexity.  Many abstract games are too stark and
simple for my taste.  Between the sculpted pieces and the variety of
different moves, all it takes is a bit of imagination to see it as a
stylized battle, an abstract wargame.  In fact, writers associate chess
with battle all the time--and that's one of the things I especially
like about it.  It's much harder for me to imagine checkers as a
battle.  I've read that the game of go is a stylized war--but that's
pretty hard to picture too; it's more like a game of settlement or a
big land grab.

When a game doesn't seem to be a metaphor or stylistic representation
of anything, it starts to seem like just a mathematical exercise to me.
 That's when it starts to seem dry and boring--all work and no play.
