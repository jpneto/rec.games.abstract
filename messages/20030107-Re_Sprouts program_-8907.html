Hi Harry, thanks for this, although I was already aware of that site. That
program only lets two human opponents play each other, ensuring they make
legal moves and showing what moves they make - it doesn't actually play the
game itself, i.e. as a player.

I briefly tried out that site, and I discovered that because of the
graphical nature of the implementation, it allows you to play a slightly
different game than normal sprouts.

The difference is that a move that would be legal in sprouts is prevented if
there is not enough room to sneak your cursor through.  It is easy to set up
such a position by making two moves into a node, forming a tight V.  I did
this by accident on my first try.

I wonder if the resulting game is interesting to sprouts players.
