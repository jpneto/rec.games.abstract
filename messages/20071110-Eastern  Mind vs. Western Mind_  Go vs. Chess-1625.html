<div class="moz-text-flowed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Whom It May Concern:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been researching the question of habits of mind and culture 
as being promoted by and/or reflected by certain board games.&nbsp; In 
particular, I have been investigating whether weiqi/go is representative 
of the “Asian mind” and whether international chess is representative of 
the “Western mind.”
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, I am not alone in raising this question.&nbsp; Analysts in 
political and military fields have been suggesting that weiqi/go, in 
particular, is emblematic of a particularly Chinese world view, rooted 
in Chinese philosophy and the Chinese practice of diplomacy and war.&nbsp; In 
contrast, international chess (along with poker, boxing and American 
football), have been proposed as expressive of a generically Western and 
particularly American world view, grounded in assumptions about conflict 
systematized in a magisterial fashion by Carl von Clausewitz in the 19th 
century (with roots going back much further) and largely vindicated by 
American experience throughout the 20th century and still being refined 
by Americans in the 21st century.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The writers I have reviewed argue that achieving “victory” depends 
upon which “game” one is playing.&nbsp; Paradoxically, one’s opponent may be 
playing an entirely different game.&nbsp; One is ignorant of such a datum at 
one’s peril.&nbsp; Specifically, Americans have been playing chess, poker, 
boxing and football (as examples of “force on force” games) in military 
and diplomatic arenas, while the Chinese have been playing weiqi/go. 
Consequently, the future may well belong to the Chinese, as weiqi/go 
emphasizes the wisdom of long-term strategy and planning and the rich 
rewards of patience.&nbsp; Several authors urge the West, and Americans in 
particular, to familiarize themselves with weiqi/go and thereby the 
Chinese mind, in order to understand and compete with an opponent who 
might otherwise be incomprehensible and therefore undefeatable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pursuing this line of research, I have made use of a martial 
arts analogy.&nbsp; I've read that one can develop a Tai Chi body and state 
of mind, or a Hsing-I body and state of mind or a Ba Gua body and state 
of mind.&nbsp; Do weiqi, xiangqi (Chinese chess) and international chess, 
mutatis mutandis, develop states or habits of mind and cultures that are 
unique to them?&nbsp; If I were to force the analogy, I would say that weiqi 
is like Tai-Chi, with fluid movements.&nbsp; International chess is like 
Hsing-I with its direct lines of attack and its emphasis on control of 
the center.&nbsp; Xiangqi is like Ba Gua with its emphasis on maneuver.
<br>As recently as 2004, the Strategic Studies Institute published a 
monograph that exhorted the study of weiqi/go as a means of 
understanding strategic conflict with China.&nbsp; I trust that you will find 
this excerpt to be illuminating:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The philosophy behind chess is to win decisively. For the winner, 
victory is absolute, as is defeat for the loser. In chess, both players 
have the same clear and overriding objective―capturing the opposing 
king―and accomplish this objective by decimating whatever opposing 
forces are standing in the way. In go, total victory usually happens 
between two mismatched players. That kind of victory, as Sun Tzu puts 
it, is not the pinnacle of excellence. In a go game between two 
well-matched players, the margin between win and lose is usually very 
small, often decided by only a few points.&nbsp; The philosophy behind go 
therefore is to compete for relative gain rather than seeking complete 
annihilation of the opponent’s forces.&nbsp; It is dangerous to play go with 
the chess mindset. One can become overly aggressive so that he will 
stretch his force thin and expose his&nbsp; vulnerable parts in the battlefields.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In chess, the focus is on the king. All the moves are geared toward 
checking the king. In designs to capture the king, chess players always 
try to eliminate the powerful pieces such as the queen, knight, castle, 
and bishop. Chess players typically focus on these powerful military 
units as the ‘center of gravity’ and ‘decisive point’ (in Clausewitz and 
Jomini’s terms). Naturally, chess players are single-minded. In go, it 
is a war with multiple campaigns and battlefields. There is no one 
single focus on the board. A go player must always keep the whole 
situation in mind. Attacking the opponent’s strategy therefore is much 
more appropriate in go. As a prolonged and complex game, go players 
focus on building or creating rather than chess players’ emphases on 
removal and destruction.”&nbsp;&nbsp; (David Lai, “Learning From The Stones:&nbsp; A Go 
Approach To Mastering China’s Strategic Concept, Shi, pp. 28-29)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as 1969, a junior fellow of the Society of Fellows of 
Harvard University advocated the exploitation of a weiqi/go paradigm 
(“the protracted game”) as a means of at least understanding if not 
contending with Maoist China (and by implication, Vietnam):
<br>“Any school of strategic thought, whether Chinese Communist or 
Clausewitzian, contains two intellectual elements:&nbsp; on the one hand, 
universal pan-strategic principles; on the other, axioms which are the 
distinguishing features of the particular system and which represent the 
empirical and subjective conclusions of its exponents.&nbsp; The function of 
the wei-ch’i model is to provide a systematic methodology for analyzing 
and structuring the contingent elements of the Chinese Communist 
strategic system.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importance of this function may be illustrated by the following 
passages from an essay Fung Yu-lan, one of modern China’s leading 
philosophers.&nbsp; As already mentioned, the hsiang-ch’i referred to is the 
Chinese equivalent of Western chess; both wei-ch’i and hsiang-ch’i are 
generically called ch’i.&nbsp; Wrote Fung:
<br>
<br>‘Wei-ch’i has wei-ch’i rules; hsiang-ch’i has hsiang-ch’i rules.&nbsp; If one 
is playing wei-ch’i then one is bound by wei-ch’i rules; and likewise 
for hsiang-ch’i.&nbsp; Nor is it necessarily a matter of choice what form of 
ch’i is played.&nbsp; Stones and grid-board are necessary prerequisites for 
wei-ch’i; the chessmen and the eighty-one squares, for hsiang-ch’i.’
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the shortcomings of the Chinese intelligentsia of the 
early republican period who failed to recognize the problems of Chinese 
society, Fung proceeds:
<br>
<br>‘This is just like someone who only knows how to play wei-ch’i and who 
does not know that there is more than one kind of ch’i, who, when he 
sees the opening position in hsiang-ch’i, cries, “How can you start like 
this?&nbsp; You’re wrong, you’re wrong!”&nbsp; Again, seeing a piece move, he 
criticizes, “How can you move a piece already played?&nbsp; You’re playing 
illegally.”&nbsp; When the wei-ch’i people of this world, who don’t know 
hsiang-ch’i, criticize it in this fashion, it can truly be said to be 
the funniest thing in the world.’ (Fung [Feng] Yu-lan, “Hsin Shih Lun 
[Changsha:&nbsp; Commercial Press, 1940], pp. 66-67.)
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems confronted by American, and in fact, all Western 
statesmen, soldiers, and scholars in dealing with the People’s Republic 
of China or with Maoist strategy in general are precisely those of the 
hsiang-ch’i player faced with a wei-ch’i game and a wei-ch’i strategy. 
All too often the Western reaction resembles that implied by Fung 
Yu-lan:&nbsp; suspicion, confusion, and contempt.&nbsp; ‘Know yourself and know 
your enemy,’ said Sun Tzu; ‘one hundred battles, one hundred victories.’ 
&nbsp;As a means, if only partial, to knowledge of the Chinese Communist 
player, understanding of the protracted game is a critical adjunct for 
the Western side in all strategic situations of Sino-Western conflict or 
accord.”&nbsp; (Scott A. Boorman ,“The Protracted Game:&nbsp; A Wei-ch’i 
Interpretation of Maoist Revolutionary Strategy,” pp. 183-184.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not writing as a political scientist, a military strategist or 
a diplomat.&nbsp; I am writing as a game player, seeking counsel from other 
game players.&nbsp; Do you find the notion that board games can establish 
habits of mind and frames of reference and can form, reflect and 
interpret cultures to be credible?&nbsp; Perhaps even persuasive?&nbsp; If so, 
what should we as parents, educators and policy makers be doing in terms 
of the promotion of game playing among our younger generation?&nbsp; Do these 
considerations motivate you to study any of these games more 
intensively?&nbsp; Why or why not?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank you for your time and attention, and I look forward to your 
responses.
