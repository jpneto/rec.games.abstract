Hi!  I'm the inventor of Mind Ninja.  Mark and I have discussed Mind
Ninja privately, so I'm not going to talk about it here, but I do want
to say something about Y.  There is a sense in which Y includes Hex.
After the first few moves in a game of Y, you can end up with a
position such that the remainder of the game is exactly a game of
Hex.  So, the Hex decision tree is embedded in the Y decision tree, as
a subgame under certain circumstances.  I wish I had a link to picture
of this situation, but I don't.  According to the set-theoretic
definition of "generalization", Y can be considered a generalization
of Hex.  Whether it's an interesting generalization is up for
debate.

It's a fine point but I'm going to go into it anyway.  It is
interesting that the Hex game tree is embedded in the Y game tree.
But Y is a distinct game with a distinct set of rules.  Y is one game,
not a set of games or a class of games.  Just grammatically and
logically it doesn't make sense to say "Y is a generalization of Hex,"
or "Hex is a special case of Y".  Either way you're implying that Y is
a set of games, which it isn't.  The fact that two players can
cooperate and play Y down to a position such that the remainder of the
game is equivalent to Hex (a position that's unlikely to occur without
cooperation) doesn't make Y a generalization of Hex.

That seems to be what this debate is really about: whether or not
certain generalizations are more interesting than others.  One thing
Mark is right about: the definition of generalization that I use is
very, uh, "general".  Whopper 100 is a generalization by the set-
theoretic definition, and an extremely uninteresting one at that.
There is no requirement that a generalization be interesting.  But of
course, we game designers who claim that our games are generalizations
are really trying to imply that there is something interesting about
our games!  That's publicity!

Here's the set-theoretic definition of "generalization":

B is a generalization of A if all the instances of A are included in
B, and B contains some instances not in A.

Note that there is no reference to "shared properties" in this
definition.  Of course the only generalizations that will matter to us
are those that are defined by shared properties that we care about.

Thank you.  You did effectively summarize the debate and there are two
ways to interpret the word generalization as you said, one being the
"set theoretic" sense and the other being the every day sense.

My complaint is this: when I first heard that Mind Ninja was supposed
to be a generalization of Hex, to me that implied that Mind Ninja
captures the essence of Hex.  That's a tall order.  Hex is considered
by many to be the world's most elegant game.  Now you've encompassed
it in a universe of unequal goals games, whose size in limited only by
the number of shapes one can dream up.  The vast majority of games in
that set are effectively unplayable due to overwhelming move order
advantage.  They outnumber the playable ones by a factor of infinity,
as do the games in the set that bear no resemblance to Hex.

Now if it were the set of games with equal goals, in which achieving
your goal is equivalent to preventing your opponent from achieving his
(if play were to continue beyond a win), and if you tossed in a few
original examples, that'd be totally different.  But as it is, the
claim "Mind Ninja is a generalization of Hex" without the qualifier
"in the set theoretic sense" is objectionable, at least to me.
