There is a wate of time anytime you play :
- against an opponent too weak except if the goal to help him to improve his skills. I will enjoy if he or she enjoys. 
- a game in which more complexity add nothing to the gameplay except more burning brain for nothing. Instead of playing chess 4D (if Joyjoyce knows what is really 4D and what 4D means and implies) I prefer to play a game I never played before. What am I going to learn if I play chess 3D or 4D? nothing! 
- a game where what you will learn at the end of the gameplay does not worth your try. I will not play an abstract game easy to solve by an average human. You know the solution before even making the first move.

An abstract game has to be deep. What I mean by deep it that each you replay you discover something new (new way of moving new strategy new tactics and so on). As an example I play Cephalopod long time ago and my feelings were that this is easy to master. I decided not to replay it.
If you want a proof to that go to any site play on line you will observe that the winners are always the same guys (2 or 3).

Cephalopod is not my favorite game to play.  It's too "algebraic" for lack of a better term.  There's little or no strategy.  Cephalopod is purely tactical.  Really what it comes down to is how far you can see ahead, be it 3 turns or 4 turns or whatever.  And it's hard to see ahead with multiple captures per turn taking place at some phases of the game.  If two or three guys are winning all the time at a particular site, that tells me that they're either naturally clever in a certain way, or that they've invested a lot of time into Cephalopod, or both.  But somehow they're seeing farther ahead than the rest of us.  What happens when those two or three guys play each other?  That's what separates the men from the boys.  In Greece you need a crow bar.  

I've heard various complaints about Cephalopod over the years.  Mainly that it's "solved", although that would mean that at a given board size, moving first (or second) guarantees a win.  On a 5x5 board, and roughly about 140 turns per game, that scenario is a long way off, for man and machine.  I think it's just people trying to articulate why, subjectively, Cephalopod isn't for them.  And I understand.  It isn't for me either, though I've played many times in the past just because it's my game.

I'm just a designer, without being a player.  People have expressed disbelief about that over the years.  "How do you know if it's a good game if you don't play it?"  Answer: I don't know.  And I don't care.  To me it's about the structure of the game.  The geometry.  Beauty is where you find it, and that's where I find it.  The actual quality of gameplay doesn't matter to me.  I'm only human though, and if someone tells me my game is "brilliant", as I have heard on rare occasions, I'm happy to accept the compliment.  Nobody has said that to me about Cephalopod, though certainly a tiny percentage of abstract game players do enjoy it, including those two or three guys  :)
