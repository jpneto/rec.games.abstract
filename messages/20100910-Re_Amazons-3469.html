Wrong conclusions, Mark. Neither Fractal nor Cage are rejected. I
rarely <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>reject<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a game but postpone it.
Fractal is postponed because it's very difficult to code. I said that
numerous times: both coordinates grid and "physical" positioning of
cells / pieces are very difficult to code (especially, in Javascript
with its zero graphics capabilities). I had a similar experience with
Pex. Fractal is even "worth" (in a sense of coding its board).
Cage is postponed because I just didn't like it that much. "PC" has
nothing to do with that. I postponed some other games for the same
reason from other designers as well. Though some players told me that
the games are really good. But they don't appeal to me. Greg's
Trilithon is one of the examples.

As for Rush.. Mark, you said a couple of times that Rush was
implemented on igGC though it was "non-recommended". I just checked
our correspondence: it was you who offered me to implement Rush back
in Feb-2008 because some other site "after nine months of delays,
they've reneged on their promise to program it". So you offered it to
me. So I programed it. How come that now Rush is something added to
igGC in spite of being "not-recommended"?

As for "PC", Mark, we haven't had any conflicts. I've been trying hard
to avoid any conflicts with anyone. I am interested in abstract board
games, not in "holy wars" among game designers. Honestly, truly,
frankly, I do NOT care about your "wars" with Arimaa community. But
using igGC as a "tool" in your war against Arimaa's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>fans<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> on the
Arimaa site would certainly provoke kind of "understating" igGC in one
form or another. What did you expect, Mark? That they would agree with
you? Fans of Arimaa would agree with your example of igGC's
statistics? No they wouldn't. And they didn't. It was clear from the
beginning that igGC's statistics will be devalued. Now, tell me,
should I be happy with that? Yeah, I can evaluate the igGC's activity
adequately: it's not that active site. And that's something I want to
change. Now tell me, what kind of comments help to improve activity:
"cool site, lots of games, serious players" or "not an active site,
secondary road near a village". Aha?
