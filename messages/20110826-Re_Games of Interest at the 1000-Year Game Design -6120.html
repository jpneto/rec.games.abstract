Or maybe it's not a problem because white can answer with two black

Or any two black adjacent stones for that matter: if perpendicular
black would have to mirror two white stones and thereby create one
white group, putting himself in a two aginst one disadvantage.

not only that, but if the opponent connects another like-colored group

Black would start with a white stone. This saddles white up with 'more
groups' and prevents a white pass, so white must play for one or three
groups. Adding two whites would be silly. Adding one white adjacent to
the first stone would require another withe one to the same group(or a
pass for the second stone), so that too would be silly.

So adding two black stones adjacent would appear to be the sensible
way to break symmetry: either the two stones are already symmetrically
placed, or black would have to mirror the move by placing two white
stones, leaving him with two groups and his opponent with one.
