The Second Internet Othello Competition will be held throughout June and
July, on the Internet Othello Server (IOS).

For those unfamiliar with the IOS, type "telnet faust.uni-paderborn.de 5000",
and look around.

Unlike the first competition, there will be three divisions for this
tournament: 

- Computers: 	 All computer programs
- Open Humans: 	 Humans with an established standard IOS rating over 1500, or
			others who wish to compete in this category.
- Novice Humans: Humans rated under 1500 not wishing to compete in the open
			division.

This tournament will be seven rounds in length, to be held over eight
weeks.  Each round will last one week, and each player will be allowed
to select one week (in advance) to receive a bye.  Hopefully this will
allow players to compete while still taking their planned summer vacations.
Players will compete only against others in the same category.  In the
event of eight or fewer contestants in a division, the tournament will
be round-robin (everybody plays everybody); otherwise, the tournament
will be Swiss-style.  Pairings will be created following the United States
Othello Association (USOA) guidelines.

Dates for the eight rounds will be as follows:

round 1: June 6th - June 12th
round 2: June 13th - June 19th
round 3: June 20th - June 26th
round 4: June 27th - July 3th
round 5: July 4th - July 10th
round 6: July 11th - July 17th
round 7: July 18th - July 24th
round 8: July 25th - July 31st

One game will be played per week, at a time to be arranged by the players.
This is necessary due to varying time-zones amongst contestants.  Pairings
for each round will be available Monday of each week, with games to be
completed by Sunday.  In the computer division, each round will consist
of two games, one with each colour assignment (since many of the top computers
seem to favour white).  In the human divisions, only one game per week will
be played, with the colour assigned by the pairings.  Time controls for each
game will be 30 minutes per player for all moves.

To register:

(1) send e-mail to me (Colin Springer, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:springer@math.umn.edu">springer@math.umn.edu</a>, "colin" on IOS)
saying that you want to play, which division you wish to enter, and which week
you'd like to take your "bye".  My hope is that enough people will be available
for play all eight weeks that I can assign their "bye" weeks in such a way that
everybody has an opponent for each round.  

(2) if you're not already registered on IOS, do so.  Once on IOS, type
"help Infos/register", and follow those instructions to register.  When
you've successfully registered, log on again and type "set rated 1",   
"set finger 1", and "set mail 1" (so you'll play rated games, and your e-mail 
address will be available to IOS players by typing "finger &lt;your login&gt;",
and transcripts of the games you play will be automatically mailed to you).
This is very important since without "set finger 1", your opponent may be
unable to contact you to arrange a time to play your game.  Also, you'll
need transcripts of tournament games since for the results of a game to
be official, I'll need to receive a transcript of the game from each player.
At the completion of each round, transcripts from all games will be mailed
to all contestants, along with pairings for the subsequent round.

The deadline for registration will be June 3rd.  If you have comments, 
questions, or suggestions about how things should be run, please feel free
to contact me.

See you on IOS!
