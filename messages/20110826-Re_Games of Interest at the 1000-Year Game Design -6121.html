So adding two black stones adjacent would appear to be the sensible
way to break symmetry: either the two stones are already symmetrically
placed, or black would have to mirror the move by placing two white
stones, leaving him with two groups and his opponent with one.

I may be imagining things wrong, but if Black opens with a white stone
in the center, why wouldn't white play two white stones, both adjacent
to it, on his next turn?  Having strength in the center seems super-
important for keeping your opponent's groups divided later in the game
(on small boards it's a certain win, in fact), and that move would
give White center dominance.
