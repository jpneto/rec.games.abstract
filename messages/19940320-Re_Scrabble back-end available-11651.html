I've written the back end for a scrabble program (calculate computer
move, adjust board, racks, bag of tiles...) using algorithms from
Appel &amp; Jacobson "The World's Fastest Scrabble Program", CACM 31(5),
May 1988.

I'm looking for anyone who might be interested in writing a graphics
front-end to this (Windows, X, curses).  You can have/modify the code,
just leave my name in there somewhere and don't make any money out
of it.

You might take a look at Steven Alexander's excellent Scrabble FAQ, posted
here and available by FTP from rtfm.mit.edu.  It lists a number of Scrabble
programs, some available on the net.

You could also try reposting your query to the Word Game Programmer's
mailing list (e-mail <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:saint@mit.edu">saint@mit.edu</a> for a subscription) to get in touch
with other programmers who recently announced that they were working on
similar projects.  There was talk too on that list not long ago of setting
up an archive where code such as yours might belong.

If you feel like doing some more coding, I would be happy to offer
technical assistance in interfacing your program to WisDOoM, the crossword
game server listed in the abovementioned FAQ, and of which I am the author.
While its interface is not graphical, it is complete, and using your code
to drive an automated player would let you test it against a large number
of players of a wide range of skill levels.

P.S. I'm still looking for volunteers to help type in the 9+lws in Merriam-
     Webster's 10th, perhaps even in time for the May 1st NSA switchover.
