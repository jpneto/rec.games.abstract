I've got a new one that I'm hopeful for.  A nice combination of
simplicity and novelty. It comes from a discussion I had with Bill
Taylor about the possibility of using negative feedback in games.

Very good game!   And captures the negative feedback idea nicely.

Good work.   The non-drawing mechanism is cunning - it applies
all throughout the game, which is more natural, and also solves
the problem of who gets 2 moves when the max-group numbers
are equal....  as they are NEVER equal!   Cute.

The game isn't quite complete yet, because it's not clear whether the
leader and his opponent should play 1 and 2 stones, respectively, on
their turns, or 2 and 3 stones.

As always, the answer may be different for different contexts.

For over-the-board play 1&amp;2 should be quite sufficient.
But for email games, players often want to speed things up,
and may elect for 2&amp;3.  However I suspect that 1&amp;2 would still be
sufficiently racy.

 you feel as though you're playing an asymmetrical game due

Good point!  I played a few games against myself, and even on micro-
boards
it has that feeling.  I played several on a 3-per-side hex board, and
first-mover seemed to win them all, though even there strategic
variations
loomed up.  On the 5-per-side I'm guessing mucho strategic concerns.

If anyone wants to check (and maybe correct) my results for the ultra-
tiny
2-per-side board, I make it First wins if he starts in the centre,
and Second wins otherwise.

BTW Nick - for the square-board game, did you envisage diagonals
as being connected, or not?  I would guess not, as otherwise
almost everything would be connectable too easily.

Well done again,
