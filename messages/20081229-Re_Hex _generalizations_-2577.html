...  There is a sense in which Y includes Hex.
After the first few moves in a game of Y, you can end up with a position
such that the remainder of the game is exactly a game of Hex.  So, the
Hex decision tree is embedded in the Y decision tree, as a subgame under
certain circumstances.  I wish I had a link to picture of this
situation, but I don't.  According to the set-theoretic definition of
"generalization", Y can be considered a generalization of Hex.  Whether
it's an interesting generalization is up for debate.

Here is a simple image which shows what I believe you are talking about.
A size 13 triangular Y board becomes a 7x7 Hex game after some horrible 
moves by each side.

This text graphics image requires a fixed width font:


    B   B   B   B   B   B
  *   *   *   *   *   *   *
W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
  W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
    W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
      W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
        W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
          W   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Not all of the triangular board is shown. B indicates moves by black and 
W indicates moves by white.

Technically, this is NOT a 7x7 Hex game, for two reasons.

The most important reason is, all experienced Hex players and all the Hex 
servers on the Net use the swap rule. After the very first stone is 
placed on the board the second player has the option at that moment only 
to swap sides. This makes the game much more balanced and interesting. 
But here, after 6  moves by each side, swapping sides in Y is forbidden.

Also, in the Y game it would be perfectly legal, albeit useless, for 
either side to play in the sections of the triangular grid which are not 
shown here. This is effectively the same as passing, which is not legal 
in Hex. This is a minor point, since it is never advantageous to pass in 
Hex.

Another hit against this generalization is, both sides had to cooperate, 
intentionally or unintentionally, to reach this position. This goes 
against a basic tenet of two-player abstracts. It means that any result 
from studying a 7x7 hex game teaches us nothing about opening theory on 
an order 13 Y board.

I would also like to point out that in order for an NxN Hex game to be 
"encompassed" by a triangular Y game, the Y board would have to be 2N-1 
cells on each side. So any claim that this somehow shows the superiority 
of Y over Hex would not be saying much. No one in these posts is making 
such as claim AFAIK.
