A friend of mine picked up this strange little swiss-made game at a garage
sale, and I've never seen it before.  It's a little black box  (4"x6"x1"), with
red script reading "Demono" on the cover.  The components are a bunch of 2"
square tiles, with black and white 1940s style figure silhouettes on one side,
and colorful animal drawings on the other.

The concept of the game is the eternal conflict between established society
(grey granite) v. chaos (colorful critters).  The rules and a neat abstraction
of social forces at work.

I think the game came out in 1985.

Has anyone ever seen this game?  I would be very grateful for anyone who could
track a copy down for me...
