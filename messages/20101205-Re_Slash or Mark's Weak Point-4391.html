Yes, Clark, you've made you're point.  Among the many connection games that
I've created over the years, I accidentally created something isomorphic to
Hex - a square grid where only the diagonals of one given orientation count
as connections.  I admitted my mistake as soon as I was made aware of it and
moved on.  Along with everyone else.  Except you, Clark.  You're starting to
repeat yourself again.

You can mention Slash as often as you like, lol.  I'm not the least bit
embarrassed that I accidentally invented the same game as John Nash.
Beautiful minds think alike  :)

You called it Square Grid Hex. If you didn't realize that Slash was
isomorphic to Hex all that says about you is that you were too stupid
to see it. I'm not buying it. It's still programmed on superdupergames
after all. I think you really like having your name plastered on Hex.
It's all about feeding that big ego of yours. That's all you care
about. You could just as easily be knitting ornamental doilies.
