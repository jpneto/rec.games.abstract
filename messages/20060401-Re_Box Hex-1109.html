David, how do you feel about The Game of Y, Poly-Y, Havannah,
Superstar, and *Star, all of which are derived from Hex?  My impression
is that with the exception of The Game of Y, they fall a little short
of Hex for elegance, but exceed it in strategic complexity.  And I'd
also be interested to hear what qualities make Twixt (your number 1
game, I assume) a better game than Hex or the aforementioned.

Good point fizzy.  Just when you thought Hex was the simplest possible
game, along comes Y - regarded by some as even simpler since there are
no pre-assigned sides.  It's not uncommon for games to be improved on
in some aspect.  I don't know why it's such a death blow for some
people, but that too is not uncommon.  I remember introducing Tanbo to
the Go community, highlighting its finite nature, without the need for
exhaustive Ko rule sets.  You could feel the icy stares over the
Internet.
