There was an old game--i think it was called Nim--that was played with
paper and pencil...
it went like this:
III
IIIII
IIIIIII
 
Now two players, alternating, can take the sticks off the rows.
The restrictions are:  they may take as many sticks as they want
off of &gt;1&lt; row, ie they may not, in one move, take 2 sticks off the
first row and also 1 stick off the second row...
The question I have is that this is a loaded game.
I believe that with a proper strategy, the player that goes first
cannot win.  Does anyone recall, know, or can derive this strategy?
 
thanx!
