Hello everyone,

Here's a non-serious game that you can play with black and white M&amp;M's
(or go stones) and no board.

1.  Black begins by putting a stone down.  Thereafter, the players
alternate putting down stones such that they are orthogonally
attached.

2.  The object is to get 4-in-a-row orthogonally (not diagonally).

3. There's a restriction on Black's 2nd move (see below).

So Black begins:

 b
aBc
 d

White has four choices for his 1st move: a,b,c and d (equivalent, of
course).  Suppose he chooses c:

  bc
 aBWd
  fe

Normally Black would have six choices (a through f), however the
restriction is that he must choose d, apparently the weakest move:

 bcd
aBWBe
 hgf

Play is thereafter unrestricted, with White to move (choices of a
through h).

I played around with this game for a couple of hours last night and
was entertained.  Some comments:

The "orthogonally attached" rule means that a board is unnecessary,
and I suspect it has the side benefit of limiting offensive options
(which would otherwise be too powerful).

I found no obvious way for either Black or White to force a win.  That
being said, I think it's likely that repeated play would reveal a need
to add a further balancing restriction or two.

The average game lasted about thirty moves.  I don't know how many
packs of black and white M&amp;M's that would necessitate.

Steve
