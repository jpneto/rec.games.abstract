How about the actual judging process?  Someone already mentioned this
system, or something like it I think, but here's the idea: Each of 3 judges
has 100 points to work with, and they can distribute those points to the
games in any manner they wish, so long as all the game scores total 100 for
each judge.  Then add up the scores for each game.  If there's a tie, each
judge votes for the single game of his choice.

Could still be a tie, but that's unlikely. I don't see the need to
make it anymore complicated than this.

The applets are more oif a problem. Cameron is a professional who
probably has the means and connections to provide an applet. Larry's
game is based on an intuiging idea, but the implementation is rather
abundant - not an easy applet probably. Twisties, if to be implemented
in a way that supports clarity, would probably need a lot of work on
graphics.
I'm only too glad Greg did Grabber :)
