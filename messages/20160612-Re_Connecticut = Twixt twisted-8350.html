I am done arguing with you Hazen because you are such an unassimilable  (or non-entity rather), you apparently can't even read English correctly, having just inverted what I actually said.

In the words of Harold Bloom: He can't think, he can't write. There is no discernible talent.

You are so stupid that in your dumb mind anyone who does not speak correctly English is dumb! 
You are the dumbness personified.
Answer to my questions about your crappygoo game Connecticut instead of diverting attention.

I think you are dumb because your a dumbass not for want of any particular skill or knowledge. Just because you are an all around idiot. I haven't diverted anything. I've basically said that I hardly give a shit about Connecticut in the first place and I give even less of a shit about respecting the reputation of Twixt. Compare Connecticut to a good game and then maybe I will care but its unlikely due to how little of a shit I give about any of this
