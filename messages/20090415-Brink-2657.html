Brink:

Another unplayed, untested idea.  I love the idea of the win condition
"largest group wins", because it's one of the most intuitive ideas in
all of game-dom.  But it needs a tweak to make an interesting game.
One attempt follows.  I hope this one works out because I like its
concept.

For two players, played with black and white stones on a hexagonal
tiling.  I don't know what the optimal board shape/size will be yet.

Player 1 owns the black stones and player 2 owns the white.

1.  Board begins empty.
2.  Starting with black, players take turns putting a stone onto any
empty space.
3.  Game ends when board is full.
4.  The player with the largest connected group on the board loses,
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>unless<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that group is at least X stones larger than the largest
connected group of the other color.  In that case, the player with the
largest group wins.

If the largest groups of both colors are of the same size, then
compare second-largest groups.  Whoever's second-largest group is
bigger wins.  If <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>those<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> are tied, compare 3rd largest groups, etc.
If it's tied all the way down the line, the game is a draw.

The idea is to set the value of X so that there is a good balance
between trying to make the smallest group and trying to make the
largest group in order to win.  Obviously, the ideal value for X will
depend on the board you're playing on.
