Which reminds me...

Given that China's Chang Hao defeated Japan's best players, and then
South Korea's Lee Chang Ho defeated Chang Hao, it may be that some in
Japan felt that bringing about a resurgence in the popularity of Go
there, in order that stronger players might arise from a larger field,
was a matter of national honor.

Look at the adulation received by Robert J. Fischer, or by Van
Cliburn. What if the Russians, or even another country not perceived
as hostile - such as Japan - had the world's top baseball team?

And then there's Taiwan's Chou Chun-Hsun (Zhou1 Jun4 Xun1, as someone
noted). I think some of the articles I've found concerning him were
garbled, as one claimed he was the world Go champion, and another said
that, fresh from winning his first world Go title, he also became the
world Chess champion.

Anand Viswarathan might find that surprising. It's possible, of
course, that the page, being translated from Chinese, was refering to
Hsiang Ch'i, or Chinese Chess, but that is not certain.

And even the DPRK - North Korea to most of us - participates in
international Go competition; they even run a Go server on the
Internet!
