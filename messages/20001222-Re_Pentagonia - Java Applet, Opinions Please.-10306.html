We are working to improve the AI for intermediate and expert levels. I
myself have no difficulty defeating the computer at expert level, and am not
surprised to learn the you do not either. However, it is capable of those
who are just  learning the game.

And just because you can beat our program at expert level does not mean that
our game is "Nine Men's Morris." We believe it is a superior game: more
fluid and dynamic with a much less signficant first move advantage.

It is too bad we do not yet have a way to play against each other on-line,
except perhaps the cumbersome record each move and exchange email method, or
I'd challenge you to a game or ten,
and see if I can get you to come around to our pov. :-)
