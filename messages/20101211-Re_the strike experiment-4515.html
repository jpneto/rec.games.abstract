You derailed it by yourself by using it to make a totally gratuitous 
insult about someone else you obviously have a grudge against. That you 
cannot see that shows up exactly what kind of person you are, and it 
also highlights the untruth of what you later write:

You see, I don't take life all that seriously, and I don't take you
seriously at all, but I do take games seriously. Which one of those
three bothers you most?

The obviously untrue one: the one where you say that you don't take life 
all that seriously, because the amount of time you have devoted to 
insulting two people who just happened to be key members of a group 
which ignored one of your posts shows it to be untrue. Whether you are 
deluded, or are lying about not taking life too seriously, only you can 
know for sure.

But your last question is really loaded, and shows that, whatever your 
skills at games may be, critical thinking is not one of your strengths.
