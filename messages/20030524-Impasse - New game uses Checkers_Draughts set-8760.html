I recently developed a new game, Impasse, which uses a standard
Checkers/Draughts set.  The object is to remove all, or all but one of your
own pieces from the board.  There is no killing or capturing.  It's kind of
a blocking, racing game.  Draws and ties cannot occur.

Impasse rules of play: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://impasse.net">http://impasse.net</a>

In my first game, Quadrature, I found out that draws are possible and I
wasn't too happy about that.  In my next game, Tanbo, I made sure draws
would not be possible.  Same for Impasse.  This is important to me, although
it might not matter to you.  Does it?  I call such games
"conclusive-outcome" games, but there must be a better description.

I tried to maximize the game tree in Impasse by making the pieces move back
and forth several times across the board.  You're kind of limited with a
Checkers set by the small size of the board and the uniform pieces.  A Go
board (used for Tanbo) is 5-1/2 times larger.  Or 11 times larger if you
only use the dark Checkers squares.

Another goal was to make the gameplay steady, without huge advantage or
sudden death possibilities.  If that makes it boring, sorry about that.

Let me know what you think.

Eventually I will program an Impasse game server - after I finish the Tanbo
game server (tanbo.com).
