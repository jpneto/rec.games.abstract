I have only scanned over most of it, but I can't superficially see
anything that would rule out a lot of non-abstract games with a clear theme.

Beyond that, I would ask "what is the point of this document?".  Is
there anything to gain from "standardising" ASGs in such a manner, and
if so what and for whom?  In a book (i.e., David Parlett's Oxford
History of Board Games) it makes sense to categorise things as it allows
a degree of structure to the document as a whole, but beyond allowing a
structural narrative is it particularly useful to categorise in these
ways?  I don't play Go because it's a territory game with sequential
turns and piece capture, I play it because it's good and I like it.  The
same reasons I play the utterly different game of Bezique

I will look over Parlett's book if I can.  The categories were based
off of the way Zillions site categorizes it.  The reason for the
categorization is mostly for tournament play.  It is useful for
determining champions of classes of games, but also if you wanted to
have a range of games, Athlons, then you want a representative game of
each type.

It comes across as a document to formally write down what we already
know, which may or may not be a Good Thing.  There are times when that's
handy, but there are times when you spend a lot of time writing down
something and there's not much point because we already know it.  Are
you sure you're in the former category and not the latter?  Perhaps the
case that something much simpler would suit your purpose, something
pointing out it's a mental exercise with no pretensions to recreate or
simulate (or even bear some superficial resemblance to) any particular
strand of reality, and so on.

The reason to get it out there is to help with making it decide
whether or not it is a Good Thing and get input on how it should need
to be changed.  Perhaps there is something simplier that can help
quantify abstract strategy games in a meaningful way, for tournament
play and so on.  Also, the idea of the names is to give better
sounding names for people who play tournaments for games.  For
example, the chess variants site, is having a chess variants
championship.  Calling such games "Royal Elimination" sounds better
and more professional and serious than calling them "Chess Variants".
Doing this helps to get recognition.
