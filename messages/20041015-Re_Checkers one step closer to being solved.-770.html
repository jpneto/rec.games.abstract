<br>Continental version is played on a 10 x 10 board (I recently discovered, 
when my (Dutch) gf showed me a double sided board for chess on one side 
and draughts/checkers on the reverse!).&nbsp; The rules are also a little 
differet IIRC, and I think you can take backwards with a standard piece 
if it's part of a chain of captures.&nbsp; I'd need to check to be sure of 
the exact differences, but there certainly are some.
