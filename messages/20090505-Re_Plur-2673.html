Hi, Nick,

I have noted that you tend to use an unnecessarily complicated tie-
break rule in your game rules ideas: "if there is a tie, compare the
2nd largest group (or whatever), if still a tie compare the 3rd," etc.
I think a more simple solution, which would by the way eliminate draws
completely, could be this one:

If there is a tie, the last player to have a winning score in a
previous position of the game wins. Or, what is the same: if there is
a tie, the player who has scored last (whatever it means in a certain
game) loses. If none of the players have scored along the game, the
player who has not made the first move of the game wins.

An even simpler solution is to allow draws: A lot of clasic and
popular games (Chess, Checkers, Go, Othello, ...) allow draws, and as
long as draws are sufficiently rare in real play (unlike the case for
Naughts and Crosses), it is no problem.

In fact, you can argue that the presence of draws is required to make
a fair game: If a deterministic game can not end in a draw, it is
(given perfect play) a win for one specific side.  Even if we assume
imperfect play, this indicates an advantage for this side.

So, you could argue that a perfect game ends in a draw when both sides
play perfectly, but draws are uncommon in real play, even between
equally strong players.
