I have introduced not one, but TWO
similar but different games. The same
holds for Nim and anti-Nim:

in Nim you win by taking the last stone;
in anti-Nim you lose by takieng the last stone
-- two similar but different games.

In my games it's nnot the last stone, which
is critical, but the stone, which removal
cause equality of all plates.

BTW, if at the start there was no stone on
one or more of the plates then the justice
(resp. injustice) game is reduced to Nim
(or, respectively, to anti-Nim).

I thought your original post was a joke, but now it looks like you
were serious.

I must be confused about the rules.

The way I read the rules, a winning position is also a losing
position, which is of course contradictory and therefore silly.

Can you give an example of a small game, played out. Don't worry about
optimal play -- I just need to understand the rules.

It's not <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>a<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> game - it's two different games, 
one called "justice," one called "injustice." 
First you decide which game you're playing, 
then you start removing stones.
