Please scroll down to Critters: Chesimals III

This is a complete re-doing of an idea I had a long time ago. I learned a lot in developing related games over the past several years, and a lot of that knowledge is incorporated here. While it's nowhere near my final goal of mimicking simple biology/ecology, it does introduce some key elements for the development of that theme, including an ability for damaged critters to grow back lost parts.

It's very much an "idea" game, and somewhat experimental. Should anyone be interested in playtesting it, please let me know. And because I didn't expect to be designing any 2-player purely combinatorial abstract strategy games - this one snuck up on me - I'm introducing it here, before posting it at chessvariants.org or mentioning it on the 'geek. Apparently I'm not as done with abstracts as I thought.

I know it's not your usual fare here, but it is only 2 pieces/side. It's just each piece has a bunch of separately-moving parts.
