 &gt;|&gt; In theory, the Placer is at some disadvantage, simply because it is harder
 &gt;|&gt; to establish an equal position than it is to find a preference for one side
 &gt;|&gt; over the other (in the same way that it is harder for the cake cutter to
 &gt;|&gt; make two equal halves than it is for the chooser to pick the larger one).
 &gt;|&gt; This imbalance is magnified in some games because the extra move for the
 &gt;|&gt; first player may be invariably advantageous, regardless of the position.
 
 &gt;Well, I can't think of a single game where this applies! Please let us know,
 &gt;if you can. Surely it's always possible to find two "almost useless" moves to
 &gt;go against one pretty good one. (This merely shows that the 2-move 1st-mover
 &gt;can be made to be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>worse off<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> than the 2nd-mover; it doesn't show that they can
 &gt;be made to be about even. That <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be impossible in some game that had
 &gt;very "coarse-grained" moves. But again, I can't think of one.  Anyone?)

If we define "equal chances" to be a position whose game theoretic value
is a draw, then is it very easy for chess, or checkers; and impossible for
Hex, or Go with 5.5 komi.  I don't think this is what we want to address.

If by "equal chances" we mean that two equal but imperfect opponents have
an equal probability of winning, then it may be impossible for the Placer
to obtain a fair position, in practice.  There are only a finite number of
possible starting positions, and it is quite likely that none of those
positions will offer exactly a 0.50000 chance for each player.  The more
"course grained" each move is (or the fewer moves made by the Placer), the
less likely it is that the Placer can find a reasonably fair division.

In practice, however, it suffices to have a roughly equal position, close
enough that the imperfect Chooser will select the weaker side with 50%
probability.  Since we are looking for a practical solution rather than a
theoretical one, I like the three move equalization idea.

 &gt;|&gt; [...] 
 &gt;|&gt; For chess players, I will once again point out that the number of drawn
 &gt;|&gt; games can be reduced simply by abolishing the illogical stalemate rule.
 
 &gt;Heavens yes!  I've been grouching about this for years.  So has everyone
 &gt;else with a bit of game-theoretic sense, of course.  But have you ever tried
 &gt;talking to a chess expert about this?  Cripes; talk about wild-eyed paranoia!
 &gt;You'll get the most amazing spiel of nonsense arguments about it. It's the same
 &gt;in any game, seemingly; the expert doesn't want his pet cabbage patch messed up!

Actually, most of my fellow chess expert friends have been quite amenable
to trying new ideas on an experimental basis.  Sometimes they didn't have
much choice, since I would declare the use of non-standard rule variations
or weird pairing systems for the weekend chess tournaments I directed.
Sometimes this meant not having an event officially rated, but there still
seemed to be the expected number of entrants, so most players were willing
to try something a little different...

If you have a good reputation, and the players know that you are seriously
interested in finding improvements to the game, then hopefully most people
will be co-operative when introducing small changes.  If not, play-test
your ideas in some other fashion, then attain a high level of power in
your local, regional, national or international associations, and ram the
new ideas down their throats.  :-)

But seriously, rule changes are constantly being made and refined.  The
international soccer federation, FIFA, recently introduced two significant
rule changes governing passes to the keeper and off-sides; and next year
will be experimenting with kick-ins to replace throw-ins, which could
become the standard in less than two years.  FIDE may not be quite as
progressive as FIFA, but remember that castling and full-range bishop moves
are relatively recent changes to chess.  It is at least conceivable that
something as significant as the stalemate-loss rule could possibly be
introduced to official chess rules, provided it was packaged and promoted
in the proper way...
