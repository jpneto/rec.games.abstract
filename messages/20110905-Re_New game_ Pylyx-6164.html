Just for the record, and because I have the impression that I am not
being understood:

Constructing a position where both players have (practically) equal
winning chances <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>with a certain side moving first<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is possible.
Examples are the pie rule, the 'extended' pie rule I mentioned above,
and the contract phase in Mind Ninja. For the Pylyx's mechanism to be
an improvement on these, it should be possible to construct a balanced
position <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>regardless<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> of who moves first. But that's impossible. For
example, if a certain position is balanced with Black to move, the
same position with White to move <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> be advantageous to White,
strategically at least. Therefore, the added step in the Pylyx's
mechanism is superfluous. I know I'm omitting some of the underlying
reasoning, but I hope that's enough.

A good summary, end spot on. There's only one premiss here and that is
that Pylyx (or indeed the other three) are intended as improvements.
But that is not the case. The analogy with "The position of the
Marquis" in Draughts is deliberate. Of course the Marquis (a 19th
century French Draughts player who played in pubs and on markets for
money) knew all the ins and outs of the position his opponents betted
on. The same is possible here. But ... Squeeze, Swish, Insight and
Pylyx do not exactly have a player base like Draughts. So everybody is
in the dark, basically. And nobody's is going to make a meal of it,
and if one would do so, it would be fun. So allow me to uphold it :)
