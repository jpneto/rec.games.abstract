I've played a couple of games of this type.
---------------------
Crossed/uncrossed - people are sitting in (more or less) a circle or
ring, some people with their legs crossed.  (this can be either 
Indian-style on the floor, or on chairs with their legs crossed)

A pair of scissors is passed from one person to the next, with the
passing person saying "crossed" or "uncrossed".  Those who are "in" on
it say "wrong" when the person is wrong.

The key is, you say "crossed" if the scissors are in the closed
position, "uncrossed" if you pass them in the open position, i.e.:

0 0                    0  0              
 V  crossed             \/    uncrossed  
 V                     /  \              
 V                                       

Use the legs to distract people.  (this may also be used with
eyeglasses, or anything of that type)
---------------------
There is another game called (I think) "murder".  You deal one playing
card to each player, including one queen of spades.  The one receiving
the QoS is the murderer, and kills people by winking at them.  Once
winked at, a player must declare "I'm dead" and is out of the game.

The turn is over when all players are dead, or when a player who is
alive guesses who the murderer is.  Of course, the "I'm dead" should not
be declared instantaneously, so as to immediately reveal the murderer.

This game can be played amidst normal conversation, and indeed is best
as such.
---------------------
I don't think these games really follow the teamwork/win-win principles
that the original poster is asking for, but we played them in the same
groups as the "I like coffee but I don't like tea" game, so I have
suggested them here.
