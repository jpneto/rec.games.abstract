The game is over as soon as there is exactly one connected graph, no
more, of line-segments drawn on the grid. The initial single connected
graph, formed when the first move of the game is made, does not end
the game. (Otherwise, what a dumb game this would be!)

The description was a bit confusing because you "borrowed" terms from
graph theory but didn't quite use them as I expected.  In particular,
I gather your "connected graph" really means "connected subgraph", in
that it does not (in most cases) include all the dots/vertices.  Or,
to put it another way, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> you are deliberately NOT counting all
the unused vertices, which in graph theory would be connected subgraphs
each consisting of a single vertex and zero edges.  And then, your
game-ending condition is that all of the vertices THAT HAVE BEEN USED
SO FAR are in a single connected subgraph.  That's why you needed to
add your caveat about the first line segment, so that the single
subgraph with two vertices and one edge did not end the game.

But assuming I'm correct in interpreting your rules, the game is still
pretty dumb, because the first player cannot win against best play.
Proof: Suppose it is possible for the first player to force a win.  In
that case, after the first move (which by the special rule does not end
the game), the second player should simply add an edge connecting to one
of the same vertices.  Now there is a single connected (sub)graph with
two edges, so the game ends in a 0-0 draw!

How about a different special rule?  Instead of treating the first move
any differently, just say that the game cannot end if the score is 0-0.
If playing on a finite grid, you'd also need to say the game ends if ALL
(or all but one) of the vertices are included in the connected graph,
since that would mean you could no longer create a separate subgraph so
no further points can be scored.
