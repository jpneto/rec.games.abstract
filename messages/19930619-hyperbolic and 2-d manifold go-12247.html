This is a take-off on the 3-d go thread.  Several posters mentioned why
3-d go, or go on an arbirary graph, would degenerate into too many seki
combinations and/or be intractable.

One restriction giving a chance of playable go variants is to stick
with a 2-dimensional manifold.  Two other posters have offered
suggestions in this vein:  i) play on the surface of a cube (an
inspired suggestion!), or ii). build a board with rhombic penrose
tiles, then play on the board you built.

Here is a third suggestion:  play on a board in the hyperbolic plane,
tiled by right-angled pentagons.  Each interior point has 4 neighbors,
as in standard go.  But the figures formed by vertices and their
connecting edges are pentagons rather than squares.  In drawing such a
board, one needs to curve the lines, and points toward the edge are
closer together (when drawn in our Euclidean 2-plane) than interior
points.  The geometry is like those Escher circle drawings.  A small
such board consists of 11 pentagons and 30 vertices.  Of the 30
vertices, 5 are interior, 10 are edge vertices, and 15 are corner
vertices (including 10 corners in 5 adjacent pairs).

Thus hyperbolic go consists of mostly corner points, and many pairs
of adjacent corner points.  This is in contrast to go on the surface
of a cube, where there are no corners or edges and all points are 
interior.

A variation of this theme is to combine a normal square grid with
a small number of pentagonal defects.  E.g., one could put a single
pentagonal defect in the center of a board, giving a 5-cornered
board.

The cube-surface variation can be viewed similarly, as a square
grid combined with a few triangular defects.  Slicing a cube through
the middle and playing on the original surface gives an interesting
possibility:  a board with a circular edge, no corners, and 4 interior
triangular defects.
