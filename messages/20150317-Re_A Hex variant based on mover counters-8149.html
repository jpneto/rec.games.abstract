Ok, a few questions.  
So, both colors can be in the same cell?
Is it possible, say if players were cooperating, that neither player would form a connection?  I.e., nobody wins.  
Are infite loops possible?   Like I swap two stones and you swap them back.

Yes both colors could be on the same cell.
No. Even if the players cooperate one of them will be the first to connect so no draw.
I do not know if they are infinite loops. I will try to find out if such loop is possible. Later I will answer because I have 3 appointments with doctors one each day starting from today.
