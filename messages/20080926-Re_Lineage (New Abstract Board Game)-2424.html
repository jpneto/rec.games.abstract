So a friend has offered to create an online version of my game. Do you
guys think that this will benefit sales (by allowing people to try
before they buy) or detract from sales (because people could just play

Benefit, not even a shred of doubt about it. Your problem as a self-
publisher isn't that people aren't willing to pay for it, it's that
they've never heard of your game. Knowing of its obscurity, they will
know how hard it is to find people to play against.

Thanks for your opinion, this is along the lines of what I was
thinking.

However, I was a little confused by what you meant by "Knowing of its
obscurity, they will know how hard it is to find people to play
against." Would you mind elaborating?

Thanks,
