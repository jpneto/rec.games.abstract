In a recent post about the solution of Go-Moku, the writer
wrote that since the game was solved for a 15x15 board, it
was thus solved for the 19x19. At first this seemed
intuitively obvious: if you can form a row of 5 on a board
of some fixed size, you can do the same on any bigger board.
However, after thinking for a while I became less convinced.
Although the larger board gives you more freedom, it also
gives your opponent the same freedom. Is it not possible that
at some stage in the strategy, a move will create a position
which allows the 2nd player to take the initiative and at 
least force a draw.

Nicholas Gray is perfectly right with the above statement.

Personally, I do believe of course, that on the 19x19 board Go-Moku is
also a win. I would have to check the whole solution tree, however,
to see if in none of the lines the opponent has extra options for
defending against the black winning attack. Even if one or two lines
(out of the 150,000) turn out to be blockable, there very likely will
be alternatives for Black, which create a slightly different proof.

Strictly speaking, however, the result cannot be generalized to any
other board size than 15x15, as correctly pointed out by Nicholas.

Does it make a difference if, in all paths down the tree, no useful
moves are made into a strip of width 5 around the edge - that is, if
neither player gains by making a move just barely outside the playing
field? In this case, can the rest of the plane be safely ignored? It
seems to me intuitively that it can, but I cannot convince myself
logically of it. I apologize for the impreciseness of my description -
this may be why I can't find the proof. :)
