Again, ad hominem attacks are a logical fallacy.  If you want to pick
out any of the facts I have presented and prove that they are false,
that is fair game.  Calling me a liar has no logical merit with
respect to this discussion.

Chess and Go are good enough, but Arimaa isn't.  There's no excuse for
a modern game incorporating superko.  Standards, people.  Standards.

Some people find that the fact that chess has many draws at higher
levels makes it less exciting to watch.  A choice was made to make
Arimaa virtually draw proof.  There have been no draws since the rule
regarding capturing all rabbits was changed a few years ago, so the
rules have succeeded so far in creating a draw proof game.

I wasn't aware of any ban on the use of superko like rules in modern
games.  If you can site your source, I'd appreciate it.

With respect to Arimaa play, the 3 repeat (superko like) rule is there
to avoid draws, but I have only seen it used to win a game tactically
one time in hundreds of games that I've watched or played.  I think
that focusing on superko and how it is used in Arimaa is like focusing
on the 50 move rule in chess.  It's important for edge cases, but
fails to touch on any of the richer aspects of the game.
