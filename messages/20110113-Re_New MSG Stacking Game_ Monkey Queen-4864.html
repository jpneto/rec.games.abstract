I am, of course, the hunter.  To me the game is itself a solution, the task
at hand being "Just give me something that works."  I never see a game as
existing in any sense but in need of a solution.  Even when a game seems
extremely promising at first only to fall victim to some malady, and the
game seems to be crying for a solution, I've already found one.  The trash
bucket.  I can't waste precious time nursing a sick, non-game when there's
still a universe of beautiful, untainted concepts out there awaiting
discovery.

I can spend weeks coming up with concepts that don't work.  In my case I
don't even consider games with draws, so technically my only enemy is first
move advantage.  If a game has flat, monotonous play, it's probably
vulnerable to out of control move order advantage.

Sometimes you get an idea for a wonderfully robust game that's too stupid to
release.  Mad Bishops may come to mind for some, lol

Mad Bishops rule sheet:

After I created the rule sheet for Mad Bishops, I hesitated for a few days
before publishing it with a triumphant "Here goes nothing.  My Mercedes
E-class."  What tipped the scales in favor of release was that the rule set
is conceptually interesting.  Mad Bishops is minimally based on a unique,
fundamental principle that works splendidly as a game, even though it ends
up being a bunch of bishops annihilating each other.  The Mad Bishops
principle is also a tool that designers can utilize in their own designs.

Fashion designers often send their models down the runway wearing things
that nobody would ever be expected to wear.  Concepts.
