Good job Mark you really showed some initiative in a situation that
called for immediate action. I can see why you'd be proud of
yourself...

Sorry chief that was sarcasm. I know it's probably hard for you to
distinguish that from reality since it's your primary form of
communication. Anyway I'm going to tell you the truth because your a
good guy and I think that's what you deserve. The truth is this seems
like the usual douchebaggery that anyone who's witnessed your online
behavior is familiar with. The guy asked you about a move in a game of
little consequence and instead of telling him you would not help him
on principle, you bite his fucking head off. You go and tell on him
like Randal Weems. If I was the admin at that site, I wouldn't have
only terminated that match but Dipole altogether. I mean what a
fucking boring game! My god was it dull. I would have found sorting a
variety of dried beans into a matrix preferable. No wonder you never
see anyone playing it on iggamecenter. You know Mark for all your
integrity you sure have made some boring ass games.
