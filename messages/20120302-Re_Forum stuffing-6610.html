Graham, I like you and I appreciate the effort you've put into Redstone thus far.  But don't show up at rec.games.abstract and play New Sheriff in Town.  New sheriffs don't last long here.  That's why they're new.

How you spend your time is your business.  I admit, I got caught up in the Redstone enthusiasm at LifeIn19x19 - probably a mistake on my part.  In fact, your involvement in Redstone, Graham, won't matter a heck of a lot in the long run.  If Redstone is a good game, there will be other Grahams.  If it sucks, there won't be other Grahams.

A little perspective.  I've already got more games programmed on more servers than any other modern designer, by far.  My best game, Oust, is vastly superior to Go.  Oust won't peak until hundreds of years after I'm gone.  My very best games such as Oust, Fractal, Atoll, etc. will span the centuries, independent of what servers have implemented which of my games so far, or which of my games Graham decides to embrace.

Yes, I'd like to see Redstone take off more sooner than later.  I'm only human and I'm having fun with this shit.  I will not be modifying my behavior one iota to appease snotty Go players (not that you're snotty, Graham).  It wouldn't make any difference if I did.  If Redstone was meant to fly, it will fly, regardless of how "adult" I behave.

This was hardly a throat ripping.  I would call it a mild rebuke in response to myself and others I've spoken with privately being put off by Christian's forum stuffing.  

Rga is more of a working environment than a thriving community.  Kind of a hotbed of metadesign.  You run your thriving community and let us run ours.
