Richard's Play-By-eMail (PBeM) Server Monthly Posting

A generic Play-By-eMail Server has been set up at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@netcom.com">pbmserv@netcom.com</a>.  It
currently supports four games (Trax, TwixT, Hex and Abalone) with others
to be added in the future.  

To get more information send mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@netcom.com">pbmserv@netcom.com</a> with 'help' as the
subject line.

Games Currently Supported

Trax ((c) David Smith)

    Trax is a game played with square tiles.  Each tile is identical
    to all other tiles, one side has a white line connecting opposite
    edges and a black line connecting the other edges, and the other
    side has a white line connecting 2 adjacent edges and a black line
    connecting the other edges.

    The object of the game is to create a loop of your color while
    preventing your opponent from doing the same.  An alternate winning
    condition is to create a line extending from one edge of the board
    to the opposite edge of the board when the board is at least 8
    tiles wide (or tall).

TwixT ((c) Avalon Hill)

    On a 24x24 board, players take turns placing pegs of their color
    on the board.  Any time a peg is placed a "knight's move" from 
    another peg of the same color, a strut is placed, connecting them.
    A strut can not cross over (through) another strut.  The object is 
    to connect your sides of the board while preventing your opponent
    from doing the same.

Hex
 
    On a 11x11 diamond board, players take turns placing stones of
    their color on the board. The object is to connect your sides of
    the board while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

Abalone

    On a hexagonal board (radius 5) two to six players have armies of
    marbles.  Players take turns "pushing" 1, 2 or 3 linearly connected
    marbles, attempting to push their opponents' marbles off the board.

C++Robots ((c) 1994 Richard Rognlie)

    An ongoing "King of the Hill" (KotH) tournament in which players
    use the C++ language to create a control program for a robot.  Your
    robot then fights each of the other robots "on the hill".  If you
    do well enough, your robot will "make the hill", bumping the lowest
    robot from the hill.

    Robots have the ability to scan for opponents, fire a cannon, move,
    and determine current position and status.

    Conceptually based on C-Robots written for the IBM PC by Tom Pointdexter.


Games that will be supported in the near future...

Terrace      (Winter '95)

    On a terraced 8x8 board, 2 to 4 players take turns attempting to 
    either capture their opponents' key pieces or moving their own key
    piece to the opposite low corner.  The board is terraced so that two
    opposite corners are low (level 1), and two corners are high (level
    8).  Unusual movement and capture rules make this game interesting.
