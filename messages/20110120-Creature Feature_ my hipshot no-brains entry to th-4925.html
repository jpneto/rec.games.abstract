With all the games I've seen that are on squares, I thought a hex
variant might be in order.  I've seen a lot of the square games get
refined into a 6x6 board (36 squares), so I thought an order-4 hex of
hexes was the right place to start.

Creature Feature

1. Board begins as an empty order-4 hexagon of hexagons.  (37
hexagons, 4 on a side)

2. Two players, Black &amp; White, with some sufficiently large number of
stackable checkers of their color.  And maybe some red checkers for
administrative purpose, or a computer display capable of disappearing
a hex, or you could lay out 37 hexagons large enough to be stacked on
over a completely blank board, which would really be part of 1 above.

3. White first places 2 Black checkers stacked or adjacent anywhere in
play.  Black then places one White checker anywhere in play.  Then the
game turns alternate, with Black having the 1st game turn.

4. Each player's checkers must be completely connected via adjacent
hexes into 1 group, collectively called a "creature".  There are thus
only 2 creatures on the board, one Black and one White.

5. Within a creature any stack more than 1 tall may be divided into
some left where they are and some onto any empty adjacent hex still in
play.  You cannot move them onto a hex already occupied  This is one
way for you to change the shape of your creature, called expansion.

6. A stack of one single checker may be lifted up on top of any stack
of the same color.  This is the other way for you to change the shape
of your creature, called shrinkage.

7. For each game turn, there are 3 steps:

    7.1. you must change the shape of your creature as described in 5.
and 6.

    7.2. add 2 opponent checkers anywhere, on or against, your
opponents creature.

    7.3. select a vacant hex in play to be removed from play.

(You might use a red checker to mark a hex out of play or Gone, or
click it in a computer application to disappear it, or if you have
layed out 37 underlying board hexagons, you select an unoccupied one
and remove it from the board.)

8. First player unable to change the shape of their creature loses.


Warning: No analysis - might be a degenerate, dull game.  Shrinking
board may need to be bigger?

The creatures keep getting bigger and the board keeps getting
smaller.  Beastly.  No ties.

Possible variant:  a stack of N&gt;1 checkers could spread itself out
over adjacent vacant hexes into substacks of any height, as long as
they stay connected and only land on empty hexes still in play.
