2. Capture

Sozee isn't capture.  It's capture-and-replace.  It's a flippy game which makes finitude automatic.  Where's the design challenge?  



Once again, you lied, Hazen.  Sozee is not in the same league as Cephalopod.

You can play the game by not replacing if you like.
Except that you will have some trick like Conversion and Cephalopod (not more than 6 ha ha ha) to make the board filled at the end of the game.
Let me tell you that your tricks are so dumb that anyone could detect them.

I told you before that designing a game a strong one needs time (at least one year).
I designed the game in less than 2 days even if the idea was in my mind long before.
I`m not game designer.
I design games for myself.
I have lot of puzzles never seen before.
I try to solve them. Sometimes I just create the puzzle for fun. 

I prefer my own challenges.
Now the game Sozee belong to the players.
As long as no one make money with the game I always be hapy to see it growing and improving.
Even if someone make money with ideas my only hope is that the money will go to needy people, poors kids, single moms, elders, disabled persons and so on.
