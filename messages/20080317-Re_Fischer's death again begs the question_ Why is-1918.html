Why don't they just write "soccer", then?  Less confusing for everybody.

    FUS-BALL EXPLAINED

Well... because it is anti-intuitive. The idea in football, you see, is to 
actually kick the ball with your foot, and this term seems to be why 
Americans are so confused ~ they presumably think because it is a European 
term, there are 3 levels of meaning to the term none of which are obvious.

Fortunately new material has arrived to relieve the situation, courtesy of 
Leonardo DaVinci, who drew a couple of off-hand diagrams which have recently 
ben published in England of (a) what centre-forwards should do against 
German-style zone defence, and (b) if all else fails against Italian teams, 
kick them in the leg and just watch the hysterics, while you go on to score! 
[Italians 'act' so much, officials ignore them]

Whereas, as ani ful no, the idea of American football is to <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> to kick 
the ball with your foot, since America hasn't invented the round ball you 
can kick yet, and the ones they have they hit with sticks [called Rounders] 
or throw into waste-paper baskets on poles [called WHOOPS].

    RUCKING OVER AMERICA

I would suggest as an interim stage they adopt English Rugby League, which 
is a fast and fluent game, the ball staying in play for minutes at a 
time!And which would appeal to American audiences, especially the pack, 
which is allowed to 'ruck' over the opponent [translation; ruck means to 
kick people when they are down and basically, to trample them into the 
ground while pretending to be getting the ball] - though I fear American's 
might not immediate 'get' the idea that everybody on the team can throw the 
ball - and maybe the game should be dimplified if brought here to avoid this 
confusion?

The other problem with Rugby league is the mud. After about 10 minutes both 
sides are plastered in it, and you can't tell one from another - but that's 
okay! Both teams can then go after the guy with the ball and try to ruck 
him!

The game could be renamed something like 'Extreme-Survivor' and therefore 
help get chess on tv with Grandmasters coaching each side and calling out 
the moves.

Cool, no?
