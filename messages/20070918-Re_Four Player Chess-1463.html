If you want to actually play the game, however, you will need to

join your game.

I must have looked at more than a dozen forms of four-player chess, and
I believe that hundreds more have been invented.  The ones I have looked
at all suffer from the same defect:  as soon as any one player has a
lead, the other three will combine to reduce it, so no-one ever wins.
Maybe yours avoids this problem:  if so, it would be interesting to know
how.

I have looked at the page cited above.  If it links to the rules of your
game, I have failed to find the link.  My only option seems to be to
download the client, try to play the game, and wait until three other
people are also trying to play it (all, presumably, without knowing the
rules).  When I tried, there was no-one else connected.

When I have experimented with 4 player chess games, I find the ganging
up on someone is reduced when you have the rule of someone capturing
an opponent's king wins the game.  It does balance thing.  It balances
way too well actually.

Another option here is to stick the game on a Byzantine Chess board,
so you mostly deal with only two enemies.  I have done that with my
chess variant for Stonehenge I call Fidchess Qenqe.  You can read
about it here:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://paizo.com/titanicGames/library/v5748btpy7zka">http://paizo.com/titanicGames/library/v5748btpy7zka</a>

Stonehenge has a near double sized version of a standard Byzantine
chess board (it is 4 wide and 30 round).

My corner chess I did is also another way to do this (on an 8x8
board):
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/multiplayer.dir/corner.html">http://www.chessvariants.org/multiplayer.dir/corner.html</a>

You can win the game by getting your king to the others side of the
board also.

By the way, one solution to the problem of multiplayer chess is to
have the game so that a person wins the game if they eliminate the
king to the player on their left.  This comes out of Magic: The
Gathering and their Grand Melee variant for multiplayer.

I believe it is doable.  The solution may lie in doing a chess game
based around a Byzantine chess board (cut a 2x2 square hole in the
middle of a standard chessboard), and play the Grand Melee version of
eliminating the player to your left.  You could also have a case where
you can win the game if an opponent is reduced to just their king.
