My good man, I beg to differ. Games of chance you described are games
of perfect information; both skilled players know all the
possibilities; now what is different is matters of control,' i.e.,
the players in both games either have good control or bad control of
the information they receive to base their decisions on.  The games
you think so highly of, chess, checkers, which I think are good
examples of not of skill' inherent in the player but of the
importance of outer communication, are also games of perfect
information, whereas skilled players are able to have a much better
grasp and control over information to base their decisions on.
	 I believe what you are trying to say is that, "games like chess
where both players have access to secure information are perfect, and
games like whist where both player do also have access to all
information/possibilities but not to secure information in real time
are imperfect." I can agree with that definition.
	From where I come, there are games that I had in mind where the
players do not have access or control to all information, all
possibilities. That's what I thought about when imperfect information
was used and not used to describe the mass popular games floating
around the earth of today.

One last thing, I just would like for you, my lad, to get that little
word skill' out of your pretty little head. You'll be better off.
There is only one decision to make when information is receive with
out corruption or distortion, that is to win, that is to live.

 Trust me, my lad! Think, wonders unhand, wonders unhand.

In a world of imperfect information, I see your point of view for
liking games with perfect information. But, I think games with perfect
information played by two equal players are really no games at all, no
games as we know it anyway, winners and losers, etc. The games amount
to a draw or not worth playing because of its known outcome.

You're missing the meaning of 'perfect information'. Snakes and Ladders
(Chutes &amp; Ladders) is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a game of perfect information. Neither is
Backgammon, Whist, or any game of chance. Chess, Go and Draughts (Checkers)
are games of perfect information; both players can know all the options
laid out clear throughout the game. In games of perfect information you are
pitting skill against skill - though of course this can be boring with
trivial games like noughts and crosses (Tic Tac Toe). Not all games of
perfect information are trivial.
