the game of pentominoes, as described by martin gardner, consists
of the 12 pieces and an 8x8 board.  each of the 2 players takes one
of the unplayed pieces and positions it over 5 unoccupied squares.
the last player to move wins.  martin was impressed with its
complexity.
...
a bit as a kid and found it quite intriguing.  i never got to play
the 8x8 version because by the time i found out about it, nobody
wanted to have anything to do with me &amp; my pentominoes.  :-)  :-(

Well, now you can play against my program. =)  (see previous post)

the sequence 1,1,2,5,12,35,108,....  is still unsolved, i bet.

This refers to the number of polyominoes of n squares.  Thus, for n = 5,
there are 12 such shapes.  The problem is unsolved.  It has been calculated
that there are 654999700403 polyominoes of size 24.  (see The Mathematical
Gardner, edited by David A. Klarner, Wadsworth 1981)

If anyone is interested, I have calculated that there are 9371094
3-dimensional polyominoes of size 12 (18598427 if rotations in 4-space
aren't allowed).  I don't know if anyone has ever calculated such numbers
(I've never seen them anywhere).
