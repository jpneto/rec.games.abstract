  "BEAT IT OR EAT IT"
   =================
Though this games is played with cards, and is (very vaguely) one of the
trick-taking family of games, it still belongs here in rec.games.abstract.
It is as much a strategy game as sprouts, chess and go, being a 2-player
game of complete information with no element of chance (apart from the 
starting layout, and even this is symmetric between the players).

Long ago, I played a (more complex) version of this game, for a while.
The original game was a 4-suit game, each player having his own trump suit.
However, this 2-suit version seems just as skillful, as much fun, and "cleaner".
(It is even possible to play a one-suit version !!  No other changes in the
rules are needed, except that the starting layout can no longer be symmetric.)
But the two-suit version seems neatest.

I post it here because...
 
  (i) it deserves to be far better known than it is;
 (ii) it seems to be essentially unique of its kind;
(iii) I would eventually be keen to start an email game or two.

The game has been around a fair while, but doesn't seem to have a name of
its own. It was first introduced to me as "Besicovitch's game", but such a
name is hardly descriptive. We sometimes used to call it "Finchley Central"
as a small in-joke, indicative of the hair-trigger timing needed to decide
when to strike your main blow. The game usually see-saws one way then the 
other, as every advance tends to leave one weaker. Thus it might fairly be
called "See-Saw" or "Negative Feedback".  Until a concensus is reached, I
shall call it "Beat It Or Eat It"; being descriptive of the mechanics of play.

One nice thing about the game is its almost complete freedom from <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>arbitrary<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
rules, once the basic logic of play is set. The main exception is the length
of the suits.  13 is the obvious length, and feels about right. Shorter would
be good for practice games, and longer (up to 26) would be possible, with one
"red" suit and one "black" suit.

The core idea of the play is:- taking the lead in turns, one player leads and 
the other follows, until someone gets rid of all his cards, thus winning.

--------------------------------------
  "BEAT IT OR EAT IT"  (Full rules)
   =================

1. Two players play with a deck of 13 hearts and 13 spades. Aces count high.

2. The initial layout is symmetric, and obtained thus:-  One player shuffles,
   and deals 13 cards to the other, who keeps only the red cards. The blacks
   are returned to the undealt cards, and the dealer gives himself black cards
   identical to his opponent's reds. Then each gets the remainder of the other
   color.   The "leader", (player of the 1st card), is chosen at random.

3. The leader plays any card onto the table. The follower EITHER picks it
   up, OR (if he can, &amp; wishes to), beats it by playing a higher card of the 
   same suit. These cards stay on the table, and the follower becomes the 
   leader for the next play.   Continue with (3) again.

4. On any play, the follower, may, if he desires, (&amp; must, if unable to beat the
   card led), pick up all the cards on the table, and add them to his hand. 
   The leader remains as leader for the next play.  Continue with (3).

5. Whoever first plays the last card left in his hand, is the winner.
   (It is immaterial whether this occurs as a lead or a follow.)
-------------------------------------

So, the idea is to get rid of all your cards. But it is essential along the
way to sometimes (optionally) pick up all the tabled cards, to get some of the
high ones there, (even though this hinders your main goal, of course).

And often, (especially if the opponent is close to winning, or has too few
low cards for comfort), you will have to lead a high card that he CAN'T beat,
forcing him to pick up all the junk on the table. 

Remember, all played cards, leaders and beaters, stay on the table (face up),
until one player chooses to or is forced to "eat" them, i.e. pick them all
up, and suffer being follower again for the start of the next series of plays.
As long as no-one "eats" the stuff on the table, the lead alternates.


So there it is. It is a great game; and as I say, one of complete information.
In fact it is standard for both players to keep their hands face up on the
table in front of them, for convenience; (these hands are only on the
physical table of course, not the "logical" table).  If you try it out, you 
will quickly notice the negative feedback element mentioned above. 

It is usually an advantage to start, but by no means always; it depends on the
nature of the starting layout, and perhaps on the parity of the suit length.   

I warmly recommend everyone to give it a try.



To indicate the nature of the play, here is a sample game, with a 7-suit pack.

===========================================
Initial layout: (LEFT has the opening lead)  
 
LEFT: hearts A Q T 9 8      RIGHT: hearts K J
      spades K J                   spades A Q T 9 8

8h, Jh.    8s, Js.    9h, Kh.   9s, LEFT eats all (by choice).


Layout now:  (RIGHT is on lead)

LEFT: hearts A K Q J T 9 8     RIGHT: hearts -
      spades K J 9 8                  spades A Q T

Ts, Js.    8h,  RIGHT must eat.     9h (R must eat).    Th (R must eat).


Layout now:  (LEFT is still on lead)

LEFT: hearts A K Q J      RIGHT: hearts T 9 8
      spades K 9 8               spades A Q J T 

8s, Ts.    8h, Jh.    9s, Js.    9h, Qh.    Kh, RIGHT must eat all.


Layout now:  (LEFT is still on lead)

LEFT: hearts A       RIGHT: hearts K Q J T 9 8
      spades K              spades A Q J T 9 8

Ah (right must eat);  Ks and LEFT WINS.
=============================================

This game hardly showed much ability on either part.   RIGHT should have 
struggled more actively in the last phase of play, e.g. when he led the 9h,
which led to an immediate simple forced loss. But it was probably too late
by then anyway.  There was a very clear-cut error earlier. When RIGHT led
the ten from his 3-card hand of AQT hearts, it would clearly have been
uniformly better to lead the queen. (However he was probably lost anyway.)

LEFT also made a blunder in the very first round; he could have beaten the 9s
with the Ks, led back the Th (compulsory eat), the Ah (ditto) &amp; Qh (winning).
(Suit length of 7 is not really enough to give the full flavor of the game.)


So give it a try with a friend, or even with yourself playing both hands !

And when you feel ready, let me know, and we'll try an email game.
