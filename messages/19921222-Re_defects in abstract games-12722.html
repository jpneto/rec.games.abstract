Ed Dengler proposes Hnefatafl (sp?) (that's NEF-tof-ul, sort of) as an
abstract game with no flaws, and Nate Smith asks for details on what
it is.

In reverse order:  Hnefatafl is a Viking board game; don't remember what
century, but old.  There are two players, one attacking, one "defending",
or more accurately trying to escape.  Players start with lots of
pieces in a specific arrangement on a large square board-- sizes and
placement of pieces vary; in the 23x23ish range; with the defending pieces
mostly towards the center of the board (but a few on the outsides), and
the attacking pieces genearlly surrounding them.

Players alternate moving a piece; all pieces move like chess rooks.
Captue is by placing two pieces of yours on either side of a single
enemy piece, all in one line (XOX captures the O).  The one special
piece is the "defender" king, which starts in the center, and must be
surrounded on all four sides to capture-- with certain exceptions.
See below, on why I don't think this is a perfect game.

The goal of the attackers os, of course, to get the king; the goal of the
defender is to get his king to an edge of the board.

Now, why I don't think this is an unblemished game.  First, it has a
nontrivial starting position, though I can get over that one.  Second,
the rules exceptions I mentioned above:  (1) no "attacker" piece can
ever land <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>on<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the center square where the King starts (I've never
understood the reason for this rule); (2) as a result, the King could
stand adjacent to this square and be immune from capture, so if he's
adjacent to that square, you only need to surround him on three sides;
(3) similarly, if the king is adjacent to one of his own men, you
can surround the pair of them (with six guys) and win.  This rule
really needs to be generalized, in something like a go-type way.

Nope, this one has too many impurities for me.  I second the nomination
of Go for the most perfect abstract game, with "mental jujitsu"
(the perfect-knowledge bidding card game) pretty high up there too.
