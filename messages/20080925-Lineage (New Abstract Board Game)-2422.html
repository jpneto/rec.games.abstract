Well, apparently Google Groups automatically closes threads after 2
months of inactivity, so I guess I'll have to make a new post to add
something.

Hi,

My name is Ray Li, and I am a 16-year-old high school student. For a
class in Critical Thinking, we are required to complete a semester-
long, independent-study project. For my project, I chose to finish and
market a board game which I have been working on for a while. The game
is called Lineage. It is a two-player, abstract strategy game.

My website is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.lineageboards.com">www.lineageboards.com</a>. I would appreciate if you could
visit it and give me some feedback on what you think of the game and
the site.

Thanks

New Post:
So a friend has offered to create an online version of my game. Do you
guys think that this will benefit sales (by allowing people to try
before they buy) or detract from sales (because people could just play
online?

I'd appreciated any opinions,
Thanks.
