I am the author of Chameleon, but I am aquainted with most of the programs
that competed in the 1992 CSC Othello tournament.  I will tell you what I know.
Most programs used an opening book of some kind and solved the last 18 or so
moves of the game perfectly.  In the middle game program search depth varied
from very shallow to an average of about 8 ply to a maximum of 12 ply! (Brutus)
The following is a hardware list and their availability status as far as I know.

Colin is probably even more familliar with these programs than I and you can
get more details about each program from him.

I cannot speak for other programs, however, the current version of Chameleon is
much improved.  It is probably playing at about GThor's strength.  But as
always, each author continues to improve their program for next year's
competition and likely the latest version of any of these programs will be
improved since the tournament in 1992.

I would like to mention that this was an incredibly strong field of programs.
Harold had won the event in the previous 3 years and Othel du Nord was the
winner of the 1992 Computer Olypiad held in the summer in England.  The rather
unexpectedly poor showing of these individuals is indicative of just how good
the other programs were.
