I have 5 identical dice that came with a bundled board games package
(chess, cribbage, backgammon, dominoes, checkers) - but have
absolutely no idea what the dice are used for ?
There is nothing in the game instructions that refer to them....

The icons on each dice face are as follows...

10 Diamond symbols (as per a deck of cards) - coloured red

9 Spade symbols (as per a deck of cards) - coloured black

1 Club symbol (3 leaf clover - as per a deck of cards) - colour black

King picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter R in the top left
corner and the letter K in the bottom right corner. colour red

Queen picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter D in the top left
corner and the letter Q in the bottom right corner. colour blue

Jack picture (as per deck of cards) with the letter V in the top left
corner and the letter J in the bottom right corner. colour green

Any ideas anyone ???
Cheers.
