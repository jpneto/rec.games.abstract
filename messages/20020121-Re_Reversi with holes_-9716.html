I noticed that on the "ItsYourTurn" website there's a game called
Black Hole Reversi where one square is blocked off as nonexistent
before the game begins.  I wonder if it might not be more
interesting to give each player a fixed number of "holes", perhaps
one, two, or three each, to be played anywhere on the board as a
turn.  Notice that holes would be immune to the "must flip" rule and
could be placed freely.  Has anyone tried this, and if so, does it
make a good game?  It might go a long way toward opening Reversi
theory back up -- from what I understand, the 8x8 game is becoming
too narrow at the highest levels.  Does anyone want to try an
experimental game or two of "Hole Reversi" with me?

I have tried something similar -- I once proposed an Othello variant
which was played on a 10x10 board, but where 16 blocks were placed
before game began with the limitation that no area of the board could
be blocked off and no blocks could be played in the middle 4x4
squares. I only played a couple of games with this variant, but it
seemed O.K.

I agree that classic Othello is too much in the hands of the computer
these days. As I see it, there are several reasons for this:

 1) The fairly small number of legal moves per turn allows computer
    programs to make a deep search without using too much intelligence
    to limit the search space. This is especially true in the endgame,
    where some programs search the 12+ last moves perfectly.

 2) The opening is quite limited, which allows a computer to use an
    opening library for the first many moves.

 3) Since so much changes in a single move, it is hard for a human to
    think more than 4-6 moves ahead without losing track of some
    disks. A computer can easily keep perfect track of the baord for
    any number of turns ahead.

The last point is an integral part of the game - it is about turning
over a large number of disks.

The first two points are two sides of the same problem - a small
selection of legal moves. I listed them separately because they can be
solved differently. Your suggestion, for example, may make opening
libraries less useful as more opening are possible if you can place
blocks (and the value of some openings will change depening on where
blocks are placed). But placing blocks won't address the general
problem of a small search space. Hence, I believe the game must be
changed to increase the number of different legal moves.

A simple way of achieving this is to increase the board size. It won't
change the number of moves in the opening, but there will be more
moves in the mid game. However, I don't think this will be nearly
enough without going to very large boards (16x16 or bigger) and that
will make games take far too long.

I have earlier proposed another variant: Each disk has a cross printed
on both sides. When a disk is placed, it can be oriented so the cross
is like an x or like a +. To turn over a line of the opponents disks,
the disk of your own colour at the other end must be oriented in the
same way as the newly placed disk. The disks that are turned over can
be oriented in any way that the player who does the turning wants.

So, while this new rule may limit the number of spaces where you can
play (due to the same-orientation restriction), it will increase the
number of ways you resolve the move (due to the choice of orientation
on placed and flipped pieces). The impact will be greatest on the end
game, where you would typically flip a large number of disks each
move. This will make perfect end-game search virtually impossible for
more than half a dozen moves (though you might recognize that some
orientations don't matter and thus decrease the number of searched
positions).

I haven't actually played this variant, but I analysed the number of
legal moves in the start game and found that after a few moves you had
many more possible positions that in the standard game.
