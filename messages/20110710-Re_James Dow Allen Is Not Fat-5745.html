What the fuck are you doing here, Allen?  First you're trying to strike up a
conversation about optimal Mastermind scores, a mathematical recreation
topic if anything.  It's certainly not an abstract games topic since
Mastermind, with its hidden information, is not an abstract game.

Now you've suddenly promoted yourself to New Sheriff In Town here.  Get a
life you ass!

You have a lot in common with Bill "I'm In Charge Here" Taylor.  You're both
self-congratulatory math washouts, and now it's your turn, after Bill
Taylor, to play ant bully in rec.games.abstract.

Bill Taylor: "WHO HAS A TEACHING CERTIFICATE, ME OR YOU????"

One possible rational response: "You, Bill.  Anything else?"

Bill Taylor: "WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE, ME OR YOU????"

OPRR: "You can be in charge here if you like, Bill.  Anything else?"

Bill Taylor: "YEAH!!  STOP AGREEING WITH ME!!!!"

OPRR: "Ok, Bill.  err..."

Bill Taylor: "ONE MORE THING!!"

OPPR: "Yes, Bill?"

Bill Taylor: "I'M AN INTELLECTUAL, RIGHT????"

OPRR: "No, Bill.  I gotta draw the line somewhere."

James Dow Allen: "THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN!!!!"

OPRR: "Oh great.  Here we go again..."
