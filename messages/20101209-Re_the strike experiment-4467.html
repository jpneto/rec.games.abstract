Thanks Mark and Christian!  Your observations and suggestions were/are
much appreciated.

I've gone through a couple of rulesets in the past couple of days.
This is the current set of rules that I've yet to play test.  I was
going to wait until I found solid rules to post, but that could take a
while and I may end up in a dead end in the mean time.  The latest
rule has to do with the strike.  It adds a sort of 'flanking' element
which I rather like because of it's positional advantages among other
benefits to the gameplay.  The game didn't feel like it was being
played out fully before this rule was added. Making a comeback was a
tiresome and virtually hopeless endeavor once a group got even to a
size 8, especially if it was in the middle of the board.  Also, other
features have slowly been turning from filler to necessary components
of the game.

Hopefully the strike wording makes sense and means what I want it to
mean :)

Dec 9th Rules
Setup:
A base 8 hex board (also scalable).
Each player has a plentiful amount of their own colored stones.

Turn:
Place one of your stones on the board.
Optionally strike with a different one of your pieces.

Placement:
Place anywhere on the board not adjacent to any other piece.

Striking:
A piece placed on the current turn may not strike. Move a stone of
your color X number of spaces in a straight line landing adjacent to
an opponents group.  That group must be exactly size X minus the
total size of friendly group(s) connected to the striking stone.
Convert all pieces in that group to the color of the striking stone.
If more than one enemy group fits the capture requirement then convert
it/them as well.

Games End:
The game ends when one player cannot legally place a new piece.

Goal:
The player with the largest group wins.
If that is a tie then another equal or second largest group wins etc...
