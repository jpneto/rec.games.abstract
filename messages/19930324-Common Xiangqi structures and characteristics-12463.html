In this post, I will describe the common Xiangqi openings/formations and
their characteristics. I will describe the transformation from one formation
to another in another post.

To progress from a beginner to an expert Xiangqi player, I will suggest
the following road of progress:

1.  Familiarity with 1 Red and 1 Black opening; eg Central Cannon Opening
when playing Red and SD Cannon Opening when playing Black.

2.  Familiarity with tactics and strategies associated with that opening
especially the exchange and sacrifices; the important points and ranks/files
to control; and the key piece in that opening.

3.  Ability to change formation from one structure to another; eg from
central cannon to sandwiched Horse formation. Of course, the ability to do
that would require the player to know more than 1 opening. Therefore, it is
the most difficult of the 3 points mentioned.

The most common opening used in Xiangqi are:
Central cannon: chained Horse variation
                7th Horse variation
                56 cannon variation
                57 cannon variation
                58 cannon variation
                59 cannon variation

Non-central cannon:  Screen Horse variation
                     Sandwiched Horse variation
                     1-legged Horse variation
                     Cross-court cannon variation
                     Balance cannon variation
                     
Of course, others like the Elephant opening E3+5 or Solider opening S7+1 or
S3+1 will eventually fall into 1 of the categories mentioned above.

     . . . |/|\| . . .        The central soldier is advanced and the two 
     R . E A G A E R .        Horses are chained. A very open structure and
                              very effective against wind-screen Horse. How-
     9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1        ever, pieces are exchanged rather quickly at
                              times resulting in a draw. Not recommended
                              when Black plays Cannon opening too.
                              Not easy to transform to other formations
though.

7th Horse variation; A very balanced structure, though less agressive than
chained Horse but a big plus is its flexiblity in transforming to either the
Cross-court cannon or sandwiched Horse variations. Can also transformed to
59 cannon and 56 cannon variations. Strongly recommended.

The 56 Cannon; so named as the cannons are on the 5th and 6th files. Not as
agressive as chained Horse; but both sides have more opportunities as pieces
are not exchanged as fast. Tend to win soldiers to obtain advantage. Good
against sandwiched Horse and wind-screen Horse.

57 Cannon; Tends to be quiet. Needs to gain soldiers for end-game advantage.
Usually transformed to Balanced Cannon in the end game.

58 Cannon. Effective against windscreen and sandwiched Horse. Usually 8th
Cannon crosses river to gain control on the 3th file. Not easy for beginners
to grasp though.

59 Cannon. 2nd in terms of aggressiveness and openness to chained Horse.
Usually transformed to Cross-court cannon or sandwiched Horse in end-game.
Recommended.

Screen Horse; so named as the Horses are screened by 2 Cannons. Effective
against all central cannon variations. Difficult to master though as these
opening has the most variations.

Sandwiched Horse/Cannon as Horse and Cannon are sandwiched between each
other. Less variations to grasp than wind-screen Horse. However, tends to
lose central soldier against central cannon opening. Must be strong in
tactics and counter attacks to overcome this loss. Usually Central cannon
has to use 56 , 57 or 58 variations against this opening.

1 legged Horse. Tends to lose central soldier against cannon opening. Make
up for that as 9th Rook move into play very fast. Will gain advantage
against cannon opening only in the late middle to end game.

Cross-court cannon. Usually transformed from central cannon opening. Very
effective against wind-screen Horse, sandwiched Horse and Balanced cannon.
One of the best opening to master. Strongly recommended.

     9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Balanced cannon; as each cannon is on one half of the board. A very balanced
opening. Usually used in Elephant opening. Good against windscreen Horse
though but weak against cannon opening.
