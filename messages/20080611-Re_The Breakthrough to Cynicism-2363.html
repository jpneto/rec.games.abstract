Unfortunately it may be a very small market.  Even 8x8 checkerboards

Rich Hutnik raised this point before - basically, just as Fischer
preferred a white and dark-green chessboard, similarly, the official
colors for a checkerboard are now buff and dark green, or something
like that, to minimize eyestrain - not the traditional red and black,
which tends to maximize eyestrain.

The checkerboard that came with the Transogram 52 Game Treasure Chest,
though red and black, at least had the numbers from 1 through 32 on
the black squares!

My memory was right - green and buff for Checkers. Also, the pieces
need to be red and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>white<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, and the squares 2 inches in size, and the
pieces from 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter.

But why do you need to worry about what the American Checker Federation
thinks, unless you're playing their game in one of their tournaments?
It's like saying it's impossible to play Bridge if the cards aren't
exactly X by Y inches with approved court illustrations...

I play checkers on one of my chess boards, that don't conform to the
above but it's still the same game.

For Chess, the squares can be from 2 inches to 2 1/2 inches; as to the
size of the pieces, the guidelines are complicated, (3 3/8" to 4 1/2"
height for the King, and a base from 40% to 50% of that height) but
one manufacturer recommends the base of the King should be about 75%
of the size of the square for a good match.

So that means I don't play Chess when I use my rather smaller bone
pieces, often on a smaller board?  It just means my set wouldn't get
used in a formal tournament.

This thread is increasingly convincing me that people are going out of
their way to find obstacles to playing games.  One of the really great
things about games is they're <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>just games<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>, and it doesn't matter if the
squares are a micron under size and the pieces 1% off the correct colour
hue.  You can still play them.
