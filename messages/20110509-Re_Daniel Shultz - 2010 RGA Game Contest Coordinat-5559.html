Life took a twist, I'm working on it, I'll push it up a notch, I'm not
ignoring you, I appreciate the feedback/prodding, but fuck off already
about the disqualification stuff that got sorted.

Just for clarity, my responsibilities as I understand them:

start a contest: Check
negotiate the judging process with y'all: Check
get judges to play all the games: Not Check
Undergo voting process: Not Check
Provide results by a certain date: Fail (as truthfully noted by
Christian)

Sorry guys.  Here's my spiel/update

I'd like to finish this contest.  I can finish off with 3 judges in a
week or 4 judges in two weeks since all judges just need to play 1
game each and the fourth judge will be back from traveling 16th.  It
would be great if the 5th judge wanted to finish, but unfortunately I
think that one's probably not possible anymore.  So if these terms
work for yous then I'll continue and it'll be over soon.

As for the video: It'll bottleneck the whole thing even more so I'm
gonna (hopefully understandably) opt out of that one.  Fail? ok Fail.
I'd like to say that I'll do it after the contest, but I think it
would be better to just be surprised if one actually emerges.

Daniel
