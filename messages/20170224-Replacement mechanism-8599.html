I posted a game based on replacement mechanism.
So one VERY DUMB GUY Molnar told me to play GIPF. I laugh loudly! 
The replacement mechanism is as old as the chess game where you replace a pawn reaching the last row by a piece (Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen). Lot of cardgames allow you to pick a card from the table and to replace by another one.
So this VERY DUMB GUY thinks that he is very smart by pointing out to Gipf where there is a replacement mechanism.
I had never said that the replacement mechanism is a new.
I said that my game is new.
Why?
Because he is based exclusively on the replacement mechanism.
Easy! You are given the conditions of replacement. You check those conditions and you replace a stone by a ring. the rule is quite so simple that you could produce 1000 games based on variable conditions.
But I will never post my conditions either here or elsewhere.
And the crappy game designers will be forced to plagiarize my idea. It makes them frustrated. Those miserable guys like Nestor, Corey, Luis, Carlos de Luna etc... are not ashamed to plagiarize. That is the only thing that they know well : copy-paste by changing the packaging.
I was banished from bgg for a while but no one will silent me.
