I'm posting the latest DPP update here, since the 3rd section propose a turn
towards abstract multiplayer games.

WORLD-WIDE WEB 
--------------
The DPP documentation is now available via the World-Wide Web. The URL
of the DPP home page is:
	<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/dpp/table.of.contents.html">http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/dpp/table.of.contents.html</a>
You can now browse documents through there instead of requesting them
directly from me.
Please share your comments with me.
In particular, tell me if 
	you have trouble getting the information you want
	you find an error
	you have information that I can include in my documentation
	you have a home page that I should refer to.

BORDEAUX DIPLOMAT
-----------------
The strategy finder is being maintain by Gilles Schaeffer (ENS) and it
includes most of the ideas currently under discussion. Further work
awaits testing, but testing still awaits a tester.

The student working last spring on the diplomatic module was not able
to hand in a working piece of code. On the other hand, one important
subprogram (Observation) was subcontracted to a pair of 2nd year
students (Moustov and Moustier). The observer tries to determine the
diplomatic relationships between players by considering the past
movements. It would be interesting to test the strategy finder
together with the observer. We would have to chose how to do this, but
most importantly this could be done before any work on negotiation is
done. 

No real work has been done on negotiation. As my research interests
have been broadening, I have decided to not personally program a
diplomat, but it is difficult to find qualified students and/or
volunteers.  

"SIMPLER" MULTIPLAYER GAMES
---------------------------
As mentioned in the last update, I think the best research direction
is to study "simple" multiplayer games. 
My paper "Stable Winning Coalitions" summarizes several methods of
classifying multiplayer games given the complete game-tree remaining
to be player. 

Furthermore, there are several ways inwhich the history of a game can
be taken into account. These simple "mathematical" strategies should
be played against each other. 

The games could be run automatically by a specially designed game
server (perhaps similar to Barney Pell's Metagame workshop, or my
Diplomat Interface, or Douglas Hofstadter's prisoner's dilemna
tournament). The program should be able to serve an arbitrary number
of computer and human players. The game should be either specified or
randomly generated. 

Should negotiation be allowed, and if so in what "language"?
I'd like to discuss these design issues with you before starting to
program (or having someone program).
