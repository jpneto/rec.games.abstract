The 75% rule is only designed for comparisons between many players who
challenge each other many times - otherwise, random effects are too big.

To be unbeatable in chess, it is not necessary to be an infinite number
of steps up. Since there are only 32 pieces and 64 places to put them
on,
there exists a finite number of possible position. And when you've got
the same position thrice, it's a draw. Thus there's an upper limit to
the
number of steps of all chess games (Which, of course, is rather big and
infinite for all practical reasons).
Once a game is analysed up to this level, there are only two steps left:
Those wo know the optimal strategy, and those wo don't.
