|I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.

Suppose someone were to independently come up with the pattern of
blue cells I show in the above link. That person might argue that
such a board could be distorted into a box shape as you describe,
but it does not change the essential two-dimensional nature of
the game. How would such reasoning be different from yours?

Mark's point here seems to be that, when the board is embedded in
the surface of a cube, the game's distance metric for any given
path closely matches the physical length of that path.

So, are you suggesting the board should be asymmetric? Your Box Hex
board is just as symmetric as the regular Hex board.

Mark's point here seems to be, not "symmetric", but "centralized".

How does changing the importance of the central

It seems (I am no kind of expert) that, in regular Hex, the
better shortest-paths are the ones in the middle (because it's
harder to box you in against an edge); hence, there's a single
area (the middle) of primary importance.  In Box Hex, you have
two shortest-paths, equally good; the more a given move hinders
one, the less it hinders the other; hence, there's no single
area of primary importance.
