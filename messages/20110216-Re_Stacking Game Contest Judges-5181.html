Was the worm eaten horse carcass not flogged enough the last three times you
dug it up?  Christian, me and Dieter, comprising 33% of the contestants,
have expressed our reservations about participating in the inevitable
popularity contest a public vote would create.  On the other hand, nobody
has balked at having judges.  Why are we still talking about this?

Christian, renowned game expert RWS won't judge in part because of his bias
toward you.  Renowned designer Omar implores you to continue growing your
Christian Freeling thread in his Arimaa forum, even though your one thread
is already many times larger than the whole rest of the forum combined.  But
Wayne and Omar are your only two fans.  You're just one of the guys, or so
the charade goes....
