Introduction to playing Z�rtz on Richards PBeM-server.

   REMARK: this is a testversion of Z�rtz, you shouldn't try it if you
   don't know the game yet.

   This is not an introduction to Z�rtz. If you don't know the game yet
   but want to learn then you can go and buy it or check the
gipf-website
   (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.gipf.com">www.gipf.com</a>) for the rules. In any case, you should check the
   gipf-website to know how the moves of a game are written down.

CHALLENGE          

   The challenge-command for Z�rtz is the same as for most games, just
   give the userid of both players and the fun can start.

   Example:
          zertz challenge useridplayer1 useridplayer2

   options:

     * If you use the previous command you will play Z�rtz according to
       the tournament rules. If you want to play with the standard rules
       then you have to use the '-standard' option.

        Example:
                zertz challenge -standard useridplayer1 useridplayer2

     * If a player has only one possible capture-move, then the server
       will automatically make this move without user-intervention. If
       you you want to make these moves yourself then you have to use
the
       '-noforcedmoves' option when starting the game.

        Example:
                zertz challenge -noforcedmoves useridplayer1
                useridplayer2

    MOVE The move-command for Z�rtz is a little more complicated than
       most games.

        The basic command is of the form:
                zertz move gamenr userid password zertzmove

       When playing a game of Z�rtz, there are 2 possible actions.
       Depending on the situation on the board, the implementation will
       indicate what must be done to go on with the game.
   
    1. Normal move, bring a new marble into play and remove a tile
     ex.
         gc3,a1
       The first character of your move indicates the color of the
marble
       (W for white, G for gray, B for black) you want to add to the
       board, followed by the position where you want to place it. Then
a
       ',' and the position of the tile you want to remove.
       There are situations where you can't remove a free tile because
       there are none. In that case you should use 'xx' for the position
       of the tile to be removed.
    2. Capture one or more marbles
     ex.
         e1-e3-c4
       The first position indicates the marble that will jump over other
       marbles to capture them. After this come separated by '-' the
       positions it is jumping to.

   How to interpret the ASCII-representation of a z�rtz-game
     * Every hexagon represents one of the tiles that constitute a
       z�rtz-board. If a tile is removed from the board then the hexagon
       is replaced by a dot.
     * White, gray and black marbles are shown on the board as the
       letters W, G and B in the middle of a hexagon.
     * The following drawing shows a typical game-situation:
                   A4 B5 C6 D7 E6 F5 G4
                            __
                         __/G \__
                      __/  \__/  \
                     /  \__/  \__/.  __
                   . \__/  \__/  \__/  \
                      . \__/  \__/  \__/
                   .  __/  \__/B \__/  \
                   __/  \__/  \__/  \__/
                  /W \__/B \__/  \__/  \
                  \__/  \__/  \__/  \__/
                  /B \__/  \__/. \__/  \
                  \__/  \__/  \   . \__/
                     \__/  \__/.
                        \__/  \
                           \__/

                   A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1
     * Coordinates on a z�rtz-board consist of a letter (A-G) and a
       number (1-7).
       The letter indicates the column, the number is the position
within
       the column when you start counting from the bottom. The following
       drawing should make things clear:
                   A4 B5 C6 D7 E6 F5 G4
                            __
                         __/7 \__
                      __/6 \__/6 \__
                   __/5 \__/6 \__/5 \__
                  /4 \__/5 \__/5 \__/4 \
                  \__/4 \__/5 \__/4 \__/
                  /3 \__/4 \__/4 \__/3 \
                  \__/3 \__/4 \__/3 \__/
                  /2 \__/3 \__/3 \__/2 \
                  \__/2 \__/3 \__/2 \__/
                  /1 \__/2 \__/2 \__/1 \
                  \__/1 \__/2 \__/1 \__/
                     \__/1 \__/1 \__/
                        \__/1 \__/
                           \__/
