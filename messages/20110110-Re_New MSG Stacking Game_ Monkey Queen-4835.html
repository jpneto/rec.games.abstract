Fig 6.
Everything sounds easy to understand except for what constitutes
moving toward another piece... in this case the monkey queen.  I think
I had a similar problem moving pieces towards the center in Cage.  Do
you have any tips for how to look at the board to see this obviously?

Beating Mark to it, if the move is a square step, it must be towards
either the row or the column the opponent's queen occupies.
If it is a diagonal step (as in figure 6) it must be towards either
the one diagonal the opponent's queen occupies, or towards the other.
In the 'diagonal case' a move may end up the same distance if (and
only if) the singleton crosses one of these two diagonals.

I'm looking forward to trying this (and the other two games in the
contest for that matter).
btw thanks Christian for keeping up on the organizational stuff.  I've
been super busy lately and it doesn't look like it's slowing down any
time soon.

You're welcome, I'm glad to take part :)

Mark, Ed has agreed to make an applet for MQ before the end of the
month. Mindsports will feature two entries then. Unfortunately Stax is
not so easily implemented. MQ has simple features we already use in
Focus, Explocus, Emergo, Soar, what not. That makes an implementation
relatively easy.
