While playing around the other day, I came up with a simple game that
looks possibly interesting.  Has anyone seen this before, or is it
new?  Assuming it's not new, is the strategy non-trivial.  Playing
around with it seems to indicate that it might not be.

Rules:

Lay out a NxN grid of points: N=5 seems to work well.  Place an X in
one corner between four points, an O in the opposite corner.

The board can be thought of both as an NxN set of grid points, or a
(N-1)x(N-1) set of squares.  The tokens sit in the squares, walls are
built between grid points.

Players alternate turns.  On a players turn, they may either move
their token or build a wall

A token (X or O) may move one square horizontally or vertically.  The
token may not move onto the other token, and may not cross a wall.
The board is periodic: motion off the board places the token on the
opposite side. Moving off the board to the left places the
token on the right in the same row, for example. 

A wall may be built between any two grid points: once built, it may
not be destroyed.  Walls block movement by both tokens.

The first player to have their token surrounded by four adjacent walls
loses: the game is a draw if placing a wall captures both tokens at
the same time.

As I read this the first player has an easy win.  Lets say I go first
and I am X.  I place a wall above the O.  If O does not move (to
the side), I place a wall to the side of O (trapping it), my next two
turns I place the other walls and win.  So O goes to the side, I
place a wall above it, O must move futher to the side, pretty soon
it is walled in anyway and I win.
