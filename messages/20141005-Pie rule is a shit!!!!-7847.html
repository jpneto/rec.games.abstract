The pie rule is truly inelegant, but it's a necessary evil.  Hex is a beautiful game, especially since draws can't occur. If you hate draws as much as I do, that matters.  A lot.  The pie rule is a quick and dirty way of dispensing with Hex's turn order advantage.  

Playing two games simultaneously introduces draws (if both players win their game in the same number of moves) and mental overload.  I'd rather enjoy one game than struggle with two.  

And you've now got a metagame in which whoever wins their game in less moves wins overall. It's only my opinion, but to me, this solution is no more elegant than the pie rule.
