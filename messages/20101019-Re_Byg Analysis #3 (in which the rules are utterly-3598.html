Note: I just realized that the new given rules for Byg give a wrong
impression: they imply that there is a limit on the number of groups
you may have on board when there is not.  Unfortunately I can't edit
my original post in this *^&amp;^%*&amp;^j forum.  Here's a clearer rendering
of the new rules.

1. The board begins empty.
2. To begin, White puts a single stone on any vacant space, and then
Black does the same.
3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn you may place as many stones as you have groups on any vacant
spaces.  Except:

* You must place at least one stone.
* If you have more than 3 groups on the board, the maximum number of
stones you may place is 3.
* You may not grow any group by more than one stone.
* A stone connecting two or three different groups together is
considered to have grown them all (at the end of your turn, no group
may have more than one new stone in it).

4. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the
largest group wins.   If the players largest groups are the same
size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come
to a pair which aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger group
wins.
