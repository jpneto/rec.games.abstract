If you're not familiar with the ground breaking work of Karl Sims,
it's definitely worth checking out.  The first video is evolved
locomotive behavior.  The 2nd video demonstrates evolved players which
play a simple game.  This work was done back in 1994!

Nasa has used a similiar technique to evolve high performance
antennas.  The interesting thing about this work is that the designs
are typically those which a human would never come up with, partly due
to the way humans tend to artifically constrain a problem.

There's also John Koza's "invention machine" which has the ability to
exceed human competitive solutions and in many cases has developed
patentable inventions as well as those which would at least infringe
upon existing patents.

Apart from that, philosophically where one draws the line between
"computer design" vs. "computer aided design" is another question.
Sure, in these systems, the initial simulation and problem solving
algorithms were designed by humans as the "gods" of these systems and
so one could arguably refer to that as "computer aided design", but
the traditional meaning of CAD involves a much greater degree of human
guidance than required by the systems mentioned above.  Either way,
it's hard to deny that useful designs have been produced this way.
