<br>Where are the references to this?&nbsp; I see it mentioned on a lot of web
<br>sites, and David Parlett has reproduced the layout commonly associated
<br>with it, in The Oxford History of Board Games.&nbsp; But I can't find any
<br>contemporary references to the game.&nbsp; I'm starting to think that it's a

<br>I'm afraid I haven't found any historic references to it either. Was it 
Parlett who said something that there were "vague" Scottish references 
to Ard Ri? It seems me one of them describes Ard Ri as a version where 
the king must reach a corner to win, as opposed to just reaching the 
edge of the board?
<br>
<br>How large a grid board and which layout are you describing below? And 
are you playing that the king has to reach the edge, or must reach a corner?

<br><blockquote type=cite>As an aside, the layout seems to me to create a game biased to an
<br>unplayable level in the favour of the attackers.&nbsp; I've reproduced a
<br>partial game below that shows how easily white (the king) can be
<br>trapped:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G5-F5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C5-C6
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A5-C5xC6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C3-B3
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C1-C3xB3/C4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E5-E6
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F5-E5xD5/E6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E3-E2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G3-E3xD3/E2/E4
<br>
<br>I can't see any way for white to prevent this.&nbsp; It's no different if
<br>white moves first; all eight available moves are simple rotations of one
<br>another.&nbsp; A game where players are restricted to moving to adjacent
<br>squares prolongs the suspense, but doesn't seem to allow the defenders a
<br>way to break through.
<br>
<br>Is there any way to make this game playable, or any references to show
<br>it really existed, or is it a dead-end as far as research and
<br>reconstruction go?
