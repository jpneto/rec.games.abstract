OK, that's a start.  From what I can see, there were two of these
tournaments, one in 2005 and one in 2006.  According to [1], the 2006
tournament was held over three days and had a field of fourteen
players whose strength ranged from 2670 down to 1952 (USCF), with the
following spread:

    2600+      5 players
    2500-2599  2
    2400-2499  2
    2300-2399  1
    2200-2299  3
    2100-2199  
    2000-2099  
    1900-1999  1

I've not found a full crosstable anywhere so I don't actually know
what percentage of the games in the tournaments were draws.  However,
the very wide spread of abilities among the players would tend to
reduce the frequency of draws under any scoring system, as would the
pressures of a short Swiss tournament, where the only way to win the
tournament is to win almost all your games.  The wide range of
abilities in that tournament seems very significant to me.

I think you're onto something Dave. The NCAA basketball tournament
gets bigger every year, there's discrepancies in talent, but the need
to win is foremost. Even though a GM would beat on weaker competition,
it would make winning more important, and make people appreciate the
draws as being better matched play.
