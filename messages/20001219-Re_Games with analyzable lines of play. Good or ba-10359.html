  I expect that within, probably, ten years (twenty at most), chess will

Not possible. There are more possible chess positions than there are
atoms in the universe, so you couldn't build a computer that could
store the positions, much less the analysis.

There are already six-piece endgame tablebases for chess (and "piece"
is here defined as a piece of wood on the board, Kings included, so
you're actually talking about four-piece endgames in chess parlance).
The set of three-piece to six-piece endgames takes 32 GB of space. And
a six-piece ending is actually fairly simple in chess terms.

This topic's been done to death in rec.games.chess.computer (and
elsewhere) and numerous computer scientists (Dr. Robert Hyatt,
programmer of Cray Blitz and Crafty) have opined that chess will

now know them).
