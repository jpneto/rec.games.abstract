I had the same objection about themes being allowed.  In my mind, not
that I'm an authority on abstract games, but in my mind abstract games
are best defined by what they don't have: no random elements, no
hidden information (which would exclude simultaneous move games), and
(I always thought) no theme.

Now I've learned that there is some degree of consensus that abstract
games may be "lightly themed."  People who play lightly themed games
will tell you that the light theme has absolutely no bearing on the
gameplay and that such games are "essentially" abstract.  Still, I
have some difficulty letting go of my view of abstract games being
themeless, Reversi, Go, and Checkers being good examples.

Everyone considers Chess to be an abstract game even though it has
kings, queens, knights, etc.  There is certainly a theme there at
least in the naming of the pieces but it's so superficial that it
obviously has no bearing on the gameplay, even to someone who has only
read the rules but never played.

In the December issue of Games Magazine (which is due out on the
stands soon, and which features my game, Dipole [Sorry.  I really
tried to get through this without promoting myself...]) there are a
number of themed games in the "Abstract Games" section of their Top
100 board games list.  I unhesitatingly defer to the editors of Games
Magazine in the classification of games.

Beyond that, I would ask "what is the point of this document?".  Is
there anything to gain from "standardising" ASGs in such a manner, and
if so what and for whom?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'll have to let Rich answer this for himself, but I would like to
second the question.  (Sorry Rich, but it's an obvious question and
one that will be asked again and again, Pete's being only the first
public instance.)  I can say that the AG document in question relates
to the new group IAGO (International Abstract Games Organization
[abstractgamers.org]), founded by Rich.  When IAGO was first proposed
as a "governing body" for abstract games I kind of bristled at that.
I've designed 13 (unthemed) abstract games over the past 15 years and
somehow in all that time I never had any desire to be "governed".

Standardizing and governing make sense for something like a Texas Hold
'em tournament in which you want everyone playing the exact same game,
or in which specific, allowable variations are enumerated. Reasons for
standardizing abstract games as a whole have as yet eluded me.

Perhaps the
case that something much simpler would suit your purpose, something
pointing out it's a mental exercise with no pretensions to recreate or
simulate (or even bear some superficial resemblance to) any particular
strand of reality, and so on.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Rich, before you invest a lot more time into the "what", you need to
seriously consider the "why".  If you can't produce a coherent
document explaining why abstract games need to be governed, terms like
"strand of reality" will forever be tossed about in reference to your
efforts.  When this whole topic was first broached a few weeks back, I
envisioned you as a character in a science fiction movie repairing
something outside the spaceship when something went horribly wrong.
The last you see of the character he's drifting off into the darkness
flailing his limbs and trailing a severed tether.

Again, sorry.  I'm having a little fun at your expense, but the
question remains valid.  Why?
