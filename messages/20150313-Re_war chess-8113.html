To me "abstract game" is a shorthand version of "abstract strategy game" that just evolved because it's easier to say.  Do you see them as having two different meanings?  Game of conflict.  Not sure why that's different. Every game is that. Multimove.  Many abstracts are that.  I guess I'm asking what's the difference.  My limited understanding is that a wargame is generally large, takes a long time to play, and is wrapped in an elaborate theme.. Am I in the right neighborhood?

Absolutely, about wargames in general. Certainly the traditional ones are - what I grew up on. 4 hour games.

I do see a difference between abstract and abstract strategy, but it's difficult to articulate. "Strategy", for me, makes it more intense, more thought. You can claim there are abstract tactical games, but that's not exactly what I have in mind, although it does touch on it peripherally.
