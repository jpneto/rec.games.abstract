Although my post was somewhat aimed at noting that variants have dim
prospects of being "the way" to revitalize Chess, I agree with this
thought about a bridge.

And I have come to a thought on this through my cynicism.

Darmok and Jalad, down at the schoolyard. Oops, sorry, wrong
newsgroup.

Let us suppose that young people playing Checkers who like it enough
not to turn to Chess, hearing of the dreaded three-move restriction
decide they do not wish to put up with such toils, and turn to the 10
by 10 board and Continental Checkers.

It would seem to me that this would be the reason for the Checkers
governing body to start supporting the new game - so that if it did
supplant conventional Checkers in popularity, their organization would
continue to survive and prosper, instead of becoming irrelevant, and
replaced by another organization for people playing the new game.

As with Checkers, so with Chess. If Glinski Hexagonal Chess, or
Seirawan Chess, or Capablanca Chess, or anything else like that were,
on its own account, without any help from the USCF, to become so
popular as to be seen to be... an eventual <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>threat<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>... <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>then<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> there
would be a good reason for the USCF to support the upstart, so that if
the new game took over, the organization would still survive and not
be supplanted.

As long as a variant is insignificant, though, giving it any
encouragement would only create a threat where none exists.

So the people interested in a new game, a variant, have to do the hard
work of getting enough people interested on their own, without help
from the established structures for the old game. After one particular
variant stands head and shoulders above the rest, and is on the radar
screen, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>then<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it has a chance of being accepted into the fold.
