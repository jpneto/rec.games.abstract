I was "bitten" by the game ataxx recently and now am interested
in some strategy. To my mild surprise I couldn't find a web page
about it which told me anything other than the rules.

The rules? Oh, here they are: it's played on a 7x7 grid
and if you're going to play it "in real life" then you probably
want to use othello (i.e. reversible) pieces rather than go pieces
because there's a lot of flipping. The start of the game
looks like

B.....W
.......
.......
....... 
.......
.......
W.....B

(let's call the players White and Black). Play alternates and when
the board is full play ends. A play consists of two parts: firstly
a player does a "move" and then some "flip"s. The move can be of
precisely one of two forms: a player can either do a "spawn",
which involves placing a new piece of his colour on a vacant
square which is adjacent (in the "kings move" sense i.e. diagonals are OK)
to a square already occupied by himself, or a "jump" which involves
picking up one of his pieces and moving it two squares away
(i.e. a place which can be reached by 2 kings moves but not by one).
That's the end of the "move". The player has then occupied a previously
unoccupied square and he then does the "flip", which involves
flipping over all the pieces of his opponent which are one move
from this previously-unoccupied square. 

e.g. a full move looks like this: from

.......
.W..BB.
......

white could spawn a new piece e.g. giving

..W....
.W..BB.
......

or

.......
.W..BB.
.W....

or he could jump (and then flip), for example

.......
...WWB.
......

or 

...W...
....WB.
......

The game ends if and when no-one can move and the winner is the
person with more pieces.

Note that one can play by email---I would be happy to take
people on at this game because I'm a bit addicted to it at
the minute: I am buzzard on "Richard's play by email server",
feel free to challenge me if you are registered there.
[See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/index.html">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/index.html</a> , I am sure
that all you people know about this sort of thing. I don't
know anything about playing by email---are there other
places where one can do this?]

Some people are saying "Christ, that's that game that I couldn't
do when playing [some computer game or other], it's the game
under the microscope". Well, some people on rec.puzzles are saying
this, and others directed me to this NG.

I am surprised that there's not someone out there who has typed
in something like a little opening theory or endgame theory
(I guess endgame theory hardly exists any more in this day and
age, one just writes a program to analyse everything, but there
might at least be some pointers) onto
the interweb. Can anyone point me to some advanced strategy?
I can consistently beat the version I have on my computer
(gattax for linux) but of course am aware that this probably
means very little. I played my ex-roommate at it the other day,
I told him the rules and then he beat me by one stone so I've
clearly still got a long way to go!
