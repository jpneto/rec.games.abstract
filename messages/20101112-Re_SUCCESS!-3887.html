Mark's pathetic attempts to spam my colleagues
will not have any effect here, other than causing
the usual amusement at crackpots.

BUT -  the interesting thing is that Mark is clearly
getting rattled!  He is obviously starting to hurt
from the mass migration from r.g.s to r.g.c .

Poor old Mark - he never thought his long-term
plan of influencing people with constant ill-will
and vile language would ever come back to bite him.

So thanks, Nick and Corey, keep up the good work,
and count yourselves applauded by Mark's screeches!

Perhaps if someone could tell us mere mortals just HOW one can access 
this new group you would get even more users migrating away from this 
bitch-fest on here. At the moment, all I have is a name, and that name 
corresponds to no group that I can find. So, is this group a new one, or 
a wind-up, or what? Unfortunately, my attempts to find out more about 
this have resulted in no replies, and my attempts have included posting 
messages both on here and to emails provided in news messages.

It is possible that my messages have not been seen by the people who 
have this information, but there remains a possibility that my requests 
have been just ignored in favour of continuing the bickering that is 
tedious to see in the extreme, and also creates a bad impression of all 
concerned. So, the main issue is: if this new group exists, give clear 
and detailed instructions of how to access it, or disclose what it 
really is, or be content to continue along your paths of mutual insult, 
and drive other people who are interested in abstract games and 
combinatorial games away from this group, and deny them access to the 
new group. This will be harmful as it will involve establishing a clique 
which will ultimately become inward-looking and consumed in petty 
squabbles, of which this current spat on here is one.

So, the responses on here should indicate what the real intentions of 
the players involved is: promoting discussions of all aspects of 
abstract and combinatorial games, or petty squabbling and mutual 
incriminations. If the latter, I am sure I would not be the only one who 
says "a plague on both your houses".
