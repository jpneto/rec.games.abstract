I distinctly remember by 3rd grade "teacher" making me stand in the
corner when I explained that I did, for example, 8 X 4 by turning into
4 X 8 and then 2 X 16 = 32. Like I was excited I'd figured out how
break down multiplication into a binary tree.

In geometry class I had a homework problem where we were supposed to
say whether or not two triangles were congruent. In this case they
were congruent, but not directly by SSS, SAS or ASA and the book answer
was that they were not congruent. I complained to the instructor and went
as far as turning in a proof that they were congruent. She claimed that
because I used auxillary lines (and not parallel ones) in the proof, which
hadn't gotten to yet, that my answer was still wrong.
