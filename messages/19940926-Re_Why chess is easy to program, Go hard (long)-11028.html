	The game of Othello is particularly illuminating. The object of the
game is to end up with the most disks of your color. However, an evaluation
function that simply counts disks performs poorly. The problem is that when
a disk flips to your color, that is no achievement, since it can easily flip
again.  However, a corner square once gained can never be lost. When that
happens, the squares two away begin to loom as permanent prizes also. The
invariants in Othello sometimes really are invariant in an absolute sense.
The evaluations are hence less subject to error, and the programs are very
strong indeed.

There are other factors that make Othello suitable for computers:

	1) The endgame will often decide games, and is very difficult
           to track for humans, because of the large changes each move
	   can cause in the position. However, a computer can easily
	   evaluate the last N (typically 8-12) ply <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>perfectly<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, due
	   to the guaranteed decreasement of the branching factor.

	2) The branching factor (number of possible moves) is
	   typically less than in e.g. chess.

	3) The positions on the edges are important to the game, but
           the number of possible configurations is small enough to
           tabulate, which makes it possible to make a reasonable
           board evaluation very quickly. (Obviously, edge positions
	   aren't everything, but they are important).
