Just the other day someone mentioned this game, and how it has been broken
by a relatively simple winning strategy being found.

But it is a lovely-looking game, and I have often wondered, can the game 
be repaired by PIE?

Anyway:  can Gale be saved by this form of Equalization, as I prefer to
call it?  Or does the winning strategy flow over to be able to analyze
ANY position as a win or loss?

It may have to be 2-move or even 3-move Equalization, of course.  
e.g. in 3-move, the cutter would play a move for black, a move for white,
and a move for black, leaving the board with white to move.  
Then the chooser would choose whether to be black or white.

So does anyone know about Bridgit?  Can it be saved this way?

Mark Thompson discusses this at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/bridg-it.html">http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/bridg-it.html</a>
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Mark mentions some variants that can be played using a Bridgit board and
pieces, and speculates that one-move equalization would not save the
standard game. He is right. Bridgit is a special case of the more general
Shannon edge switching game. A simple methodology has been discovered for
finding the winning move in any winning position in this game. This is
discussed in "Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays" (I forget which
volume, sorry.) At any rate, even with three-move equalization, the
methodology would still apply, and the game is not interesting. This method
is a bit more involved than the pairing diagram shown in the above link, but
it is still simple enough for a computer program to play perfectly.

People still play the game, though. Ignorance is bliss I suppose.
