Tanbo is the grandaddy of the school of finite game design, regardless of how reviled it is.  Tanbo wasn't the first finite game ever invented, but it was the first invented by me, the original proponent of the school.  Like Oust, Redstone, Rive, Cephalopod, and Marvin, Tanbo has finite cycling.  Stones are recycled during play, but no infinite loops are possible, and there's no need of the world's ugliest rule, superko.  Christian Freeling has lumped these games together, oddly.  "Mark Steere has Oust, but basically (p)re-invtented the game several times, and never better, in Tanbo, Flume, Redstone, and Rive."  These are all obviously distinct games, but of course they do have characteristics in common.

When I began my quest for elegant finitude 20 years ago, I was designing in a vacuum.  I was completely unaware of other abstract games, except for the classics.  I created for myself some arbitrary design restrictions, then and since, which included for example "Never use a smaller goban than 19x19", and "Never design a three (or more) player game."  I've since abandoned many of my self-imposed restrictions because in some cases they were ridiculous.  One wouldn't live long enough to complete a game of Rive on a giant board.  Some restrictions I relaxed because it made design easier not to be burdened with them.  Some design restrictions I still cling to such as "Never place stones of your opponent's color," and "Never make more than one placement per turn."  The "no enemy stone placement" is to me an aesthetic consideration.  I don't want to see my opponent's grubby fingers reaching across the table and rummaging through my bowl of stones.  I subconsciously start flipping open the fork in my Swiss army knife.  That being said, one of my favorite non-MSG games is Yodd.  Not everyone has to be me, and I'd rather prefer if they weren't.

The "single stone placement per turn" restriction is partly aesthetic and partly practical.  Multiple stone placements per turn divide the game into a smaller number of super moves, making it more susceptible to turn order advantage.  But again, this restriction is just for me.  I don't expect others to adopt it.

Regarding the "Church of Cyclophobia", so coined by Christian Freeling, I play along with it because it's funny.  But it's also a little sad.  The entire dogma of this "church" is my singular observation that "finite games rule".  On the one hand, it's true.  Finite games do rule.  But on the other hand, I wrote that dogma simply to goad Christian, very successfully I might add.  Like an Oyster forming a pearl around an irritating grain of sand, Christian, always hungry for troll bait, has formed a church around my irritating, dogmatic claim in order to put a face on the boogeyman.  "The church criticizes what I do."  Only Christian Freeling would form a church for the sole purpose of persecuting himself.

What is the school of finite design really about?  There are two related points.  1. "Objectively", cyclic draws suck.  2. With advancing skill, the cyclic draw rate can increase to an unforeseeable percentage, up to and including 100%, ruining the game by all accounts.  The quotes around "objectively" are in place because the point is partly subjective.  I like to use the typewriter as an analogy.  Typewriters are no longer manufactured because "objectively", compared to a computer with word processing software and a printer, typewriters suck.  But there are still people who prefer to create documents with a typewriter.  They like the feel of it, the permanence.  They like to sniff the whiteout whenever the opportunity presents.  Etc.  But in spite of the weird few who love them, typewriters do totally suck.  

For me, the fact that cyclic draws suck is motivation enough to design them out as a primary imperative.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> want a player of an MSG game to experience a cyclic draw.  To me, and without exaggeration, cyclic draws are utterly detestable.  Unbearable.  I would never knowingly subject anyone to one.

For contrast, let's look at the Church of Christian Freeling.  Essentially, "To design a proper game you must have intuition.  Only I have intuition though, so if you're not me, you're fucked."  Even if you subscribe to this, laughably, there's not a lot to work with.  Not like a springboard from which to launch a design career.

Now, more than twenty years after Tanbo, there are a handful of designers who seem to subscribe, more or less, to my beliefs about cyclic draws.  This is kind of rewarding in humble honesty.  I never expected it since at first the concept of "other designers" was foreign.  Had I known about them, it would never have occurred to me to try to influence them in any way.
