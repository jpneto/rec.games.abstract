I have been playing around with chessgammon and have thought about a
few changes.

First, when playing with children, it is easier to use the following
roll/move pattern:  1=Rook, 2=Knight, 3=Bishop, 4=Queen, 5=King, 6=Pawn.
The advantage is that a child can simply count from his/her queen-side
to find out which kind of piece moves.

Second, I have been using the following modification: a "king" move means
you may move EITHER your king or a pawn.  This both increases the number
of pawn moves a little (clearly necessary -- there simply are too many
pawns to move only on one roll), and stops you from having to do something
incredibly stupid.  A good example is if you start with E2-E3 (or D2-D3)
and then get a king move.  Its no fun having your king on the second
rank right away!  I've also thought about using the rule that any "impossible"
move is a pawn move.  This handles those opening Bishop/Queen/Rook moves.
It also gives you some extra pawn moves after your queen is captured.

Finally, I made up a a variant for several years ago called "card chess".
Players take one card at a time and you use the following move pattern:

Ace = Any move          Eight = Any move
King = King move        Seven/Six/Five = Pawn move
Queen = Queen move      Four =  Move any piece up to three spaces
Jack = Bishop move      Three = Move any piece up to two spaces
Ten = Rook move         Two =   Move any piece one space
Nine = Knight move

This seems to work quite nicely.  Note that pawns are three times more
likely than regular pieces, there are two absolutely free moves and
three somewhat restricted moves.  This keeps more of the flavor of
chess in the game.
