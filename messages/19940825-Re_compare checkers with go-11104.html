Great posting Darse!  Perhaps we could write a postbot/cancelbot that
would repost this article of yours whenever the "Go vs. chess"
question is asked.  (the "bot" could also have the feature of
canceling all articles the follow-up the go vs chess subject line)

This article belongs in the Politically Correct hall of Fame!  Really
though, this article should be archived so it can be pulled out as a
stock response to the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>dreaded<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> question.
