Bear with me as I introduce Korneliussen's Rule (can also call it
Harald's Rule if you prefer), which is based on a post by Harald
Korneliussen regarding how to handle cases where players play a game
and don't know which side has an advantage.  It involves how to handle
choosing sides in a fair way that isn't random.  It is derived from
discussions about Chess960 and how to have it be an acceptable
standard abstract.  Anyhow, here is the post:

In a case, for example, where the
sides are NOT balanced (Tablut family), what do you suggest be done to
make it fair?  Only way is to have players play both sides.

There is also the way that boardspace.net handles it, by a pie rule.
Make the first move, or even rearrange the pieces as you see fit, and
let the other player decide which side to play. This preserves balance
excellently, and also tielessness.

----------------------------
So, the rule is, in the case of facing not knowing whether or not
sides are balanced, you use a pie-rule as a way to have players pick
what sides they will play.

Well, let me introduce it a variation on Korneliussen's Rule (call it
whatever, like The Hutnik Correlary to the Korneliussen's Rule).  It
involves a case where there is a timing mechanism used.  The variation
states that the starting player removes time from either side, and
then the second player picks what side they will play.  It is a pie
rule for the game clock in cases when it is unknown what side has an
advantage.

Any comments here?  Do people see this as a fair way to balance sides
that where balance is unknown?
