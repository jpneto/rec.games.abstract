The game is not always winnable*.  I've played an X-windows version of
the game.  In that, if you click "give up," the program checks to see
whether the game was winnable from the initial position.  If it
wasn't, it credits you with a "win" for purposes of recording your
longest winning streak.

(* Or, there's a flaw in the program.  But it seems correct to me.)

That it's not always winnable is fairly easy to see.  Consider the following
cards in the initial deal:

          6 5
  A
  T
  9
  8
  7

Where they are all of the same suit.  To get the ace up requires moving the
ten.  Moving the ten requires putting the 9, 8 and 7 on empty piles.  But
this requires moving the 6 or 5.  The only place the 5 can go is on the 6,
and the only place the 6 can go is on the 7.  i.e. you can't move the ten,
and hence the ace, so you can't complete the game.

Are you sure it checks the position?  A friend of mine wrote an (admittedly
simple) program to check a position for solubility using a backtracking
algorithm.  Possibly it wasn't very good, but I've had it try to evaluate
over 58 million possible positions before someone killed it or the machine
crashed.  This took many many hours.  If he and I missed a simple method
of deciding it's solubility, we'd both like to know.  Can you describe
what it's doing?

Cheers,
Geoff.
