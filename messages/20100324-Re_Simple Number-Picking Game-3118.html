Sounds interesting.

As before, players take turns. On each turn, a player picks one number

Each number, after the first pick, must NOT be coprime to the number
picked in the previous move by the last player to move.

Let n=2. Then the second player has a winning strategy -- namely,
to do nothing. This is a trivial case.

Let n=3. Then the second player has a winning strategy -- namely,
to do nothing. This is a trivial case.

Let n=4. Obviously, the first player shouldn't choose 3, since
this is an automatic loss. So the first player should choose
either 2 or 4. Then the second player has no choice but to choose
the other even number, which loses. Thus, the first player has a
winning strategy -- namely, to lead with either 2 or 4.

Come to think of it, we know that if p is prime and a and b are
positive integers, then any integer coprime to p^a must be
coprime to p^b as well. Thus the numbers 2 and 4 are always
interchangeable in any strategy -- hence I'll just refer to them
as "powers of two."

Let n=5. Obviously, the first player shouldn't choose 5, since
this is an automatic loss. Thus, we are actually reduced to the
n=4 case, with the same strategy. Thus, the first player has a
winning strategy -- namely, to lead with either 2 or 4.

Come to think of it, we know that if n=p is prime, playing p
results in an automatic loss. So the strategy for any n=p is
equivalent to the game where n=p-1.

Let n=6. Obviously, the first player shouldn't choose 5, since
this is an automatic loss. Indeed, by Bertrand's postulate,
there's a prime strictly between n/2 and n, and any such prime
in this range is always unplayable.

But the number 3 now becomes playable. Suppose the first player
were to lead with 3. Then the second player is in fact forced to
choose 6. Then the first player is forced to play one of the
powers of two. Then the second player is forced to play the
other power of two, which loses. Thus, there is a winning
strategy for the first player -- and if that player is rational,
she must indeed follow that strategy. So as soon as we find a
winning stratgy for the first player, there's no need to look
for winning strategies for the second player.

Now n=7 is prime, so it becomes equivalent to the n=6 case.

Let n=8. Now we have a third power of 2 to play with. Now leading
with 3 is no longer a winning strategy for the first player, since
the second player is still forced to play 6, but then after each
player follows with a power of two, the first player is forced to
play the third power of 2, which loses.

But suppose the first player leads with 6 instead. Then the
second player, knowing that playing 3 automatically loses, must
play one of the powers of two. Then the first player is forced to
play another power of 2. Then the second player is forced to play
the remaining power of two, which loses. Thus there is a winning
strategy for the first player -- namely, to lead with 6.

Let n=9. Now we have a second power of 3 to play with. Now leading
with 6 is no longer a winning strategy for the first player, since
the second player can play a power of three, forcing the first
player to play the other power of 3, which loses.

But suppose the first player leads with a power of 2 instead. If
the second player and then the first player were to follow with
the other powers of two, then the second player is now forced to
play 6. Then the first player is forced to play one of the powers
of three. Then the second player is forced to play the other power
of 3, which loses.

Realizing this, the second player tries to break this up by playing
6 on her first move instead. But then the first player follows with
a second power of 2. Then the second player is forced to play the
final power of two, which loses. Thus there is a winning strategy
for the first player -- namely, to play powers of two on each of
the first two moves.

Let n=10. Now 5 becomes playable for the first time. Suppose the
first player leads with this 5. So the second player is now forced
to play 10. Now the first player can play a power of 2 -- which
reduces us to the n=9 case (where 5 is not playable). Thus there
is a winning strategy for the first player -- namely, to play 5 on
the first move and powers of two on the second and third moves.

Now n=11 is prime, so it becomes equivalent to the n=10 case.

So far, we have the following strategies for the first player:

n=4 or 5: lead with 2^a
n=6 or 7: lead with 3
n=8: lead with 6
n=9: lead with 2^a, then play 2^b
n=10 or 11: lead with 5, then play 2^a, then play 2^b

Now n=12 is the first interesting case. First of all, we note that
any number coprime to 12 is also coprime to 6, so these numbers
are interchangeable in any strategy. Also, we know that the primes
7 and 11 are unplayable. Technically speaking, 5 is playable, but
unless one leads with 5, it can only be played after 10, but then
5 played after 10 is an automatic loss.

In deciding whether therefore to lead with the 5, the first player
notes that there are nine playable numbers {2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12},
and since nine is odd, the first player would play the final such
number, which loses. Thus, the first player should avoid leading
with 5, so that there are only eight playable numbers, in the
hopes that the second player would play the last playable number
and lose. As 5 becomes unplayable, 10 should be treated as if it
were a power of two.

So the eight playable numbers are divided into three sets:

A = {2,4,8,10}
B = {6,12}
C = {3,9}

Set B, the multiples of six, serves as a "bridge" between sets A
and B, the powers of 2 and 3 respectively. Thus playing a number
in set B allows for more flexibility -- and the first player wants
to limit the second player's flexibility. So let's have the first
player lead with either member of set B, 6 or 12, in order to
limit the second player's abillity to play such a number.

Sets A and C have even cardinality. So if the second player plays
a member of either set, then the first player should follow by
playing a member of the same set. At some point, the second player
is forced to play the other member of set B. Then the first player
can choose any remaining member of A or C, which will end on the
second player since either set has an even number of members.

Thus, there exists a strategy for n=12 -- namely, the first player
should lead with one of the multiples of six and save the other
multiple of six for the second player.

Now n=13 is prime, so it becomes equivalent to the n=12 case.

Let n=14. Then 7 becomes playable for the first time. Just as with
n=10, the first player can lead with 7, thus forcing the second
player to play 14. Then the first player can play either 6 or 12,
thus reducing this to the n=12 case. Or the first player can lead
with 5, forcing the second player to play 10, and then play 6 or 12
as above. Thus, there exists a winning strategy for the first
player -- namely, to lead with 5 or 7, play 6 or 12 on the second
move, and save the other multiple of six for the second player.

So the first player can force a win for n=4 all the way to n=14. One
begins to wonder whether the first player can force a win for all
values of n&gt;3.

Graph theory may be helpful here, since one can think of the numbers
as nodes, with edges connecting those which aren't coprime.
