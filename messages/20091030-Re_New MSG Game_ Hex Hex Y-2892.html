Oh, and how was Essen, btw? Oust champions from all over the world?

Essen was outstanding!  Thank you for asking.  As it so happens, I was
invited to an after party where Oust was played a number of times,
some of the players being more skilled than me, and I've played
hundreds of times.  Satisfied, you insignificant, yapping little shit?

If not, did it succeed in giving some perspective to the world-famous

Not everyone has to be insignificant, Harald.  Surprised?  What are
you world famous for?  Nothing!!  Your only significance in life comes
from me, a world famous designer clowning on you.  How pathetic is
that?  Even Bullshitting Bill has some accomplishments under his
belt.  What has Harald Korneliussen accomplished?  Zero!!  :D  lol
