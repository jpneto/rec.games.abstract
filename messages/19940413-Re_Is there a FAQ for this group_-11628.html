A while back I started putting together a FAQ, I'll append it below.
It is way out of date --- if people can mail me changes and additions,
I'll update it and start posting it on a regular basis.

I also started an ftp archive for storing rules etc, which is mentioned in
the FAQ.  If anyone has rules or anything else they think could be usefully
archived, I'll happily add it.

1. What is rec.games.abstract?			[Paraphrased from the RFD]

	rec.games.abstract is intended for discussion of abstract games
	where strategy, tactics and player skill are paramount.  This
	includes the major category of perfect information, pure-strategy
	(deterministic) games, i.e. those with no element of chance (e.g.
	no dice), and where all information is available (unlike card games
	and Scrabble, for example, where players' hands are hidden).  The
	games under consideration are characterised by a simple board and
	pieces, with a small number of rules.

	Discussions about other games are welcome provided they don't deviate
	too far from this category and provided there is no more suitable
	newsgroup.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
