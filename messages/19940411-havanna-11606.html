hello,

some time ago a fellow student of mine told me about some game.
He told me that it was played on a (probably) hexagonal board made up of
hexagons. Each turn a player places a piece on the board (one player has black 
pieces the other one white). The object of teh game, as I understood it, is
to connect three sides of the board by chains of your pieces (like in Hex?)
or to make some kind of circle with your pieces (what diameter?).
My friend didn't remember the details any more.
I would like to know if somebody knows the exact rules of the game
(can one capture pieces? what is the size of the board?)
The only thing I have found out about the game sofar is that it is probably
called `havanna'. (I'm quite sure of that) And that it was on the market once
by Ravensburger (at least in Europe).

The game sounds very fascinating to me, I think it's a bit like go and/or hex.
Who can help me?
