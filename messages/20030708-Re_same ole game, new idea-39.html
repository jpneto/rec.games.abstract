My good man, I beg to differ. Games of chance you described are games of
perfect information; both skilled players know all the possibilities;
now what is different is 'matters of control,' i.e., the players in both
games either have good control or bad control of the information they
receive to base their decisions on.  The games you think so highly of,
chess, checkers, which I think are good examples of not of 'skill'
inherent in the player but of the importance of outer communication, are
also games of perfect information, whereas skilled players are able to
have a much better grasp and control over information to base their
decisions on. 	 I believe what you are trying to say is that, "games
like chess where both players have access to secure information are
perfect, and games like whist where both player do also have access to
all information/possibilities but not to secure information in real time
are imperfect." I can agree with that definition. 	From where I come,
there are games that I had in mind where the players do not have access
or control to all information, all possibilities. That's what I thought
about when imperfect information was used and not used to describe the
mass popular games floating around the earth of today.

I admit that I was using the term as I originally learnt it - when studying
Artificial Intelligence (machine Intelligence in Edinburgh University
-speak) and the design of algorithms for playing games like chess (and
noughts &amp; crosses!).

Perhaps you know of more modern usage of the term and I'm afraid I have few
references later than the era of my work and beyond the books and papers of
that time (late 70s).

One last thing, I just would like for you, my lad, to get that little

Condescension of that style is the refuge of the ignorant (manners not
knowledge). Surely you are capable of appreciating that I am using the word
to exclude chance - which is the spoiler of 'perfect information' in the
lay of the cards in whist and the roll of the dice in Snakes and Ladders.

I assume that my audience has the intelligence to dot its own i's and cross
its own t's - else there wouldn't be time enough to complete imortant
tasks!

You'll be better off. There is only one decision to make when
information is receive with out corruption or distortion, that is to
win, that is to live.

Far better to learn to use ngs correctly. It's not polite to top post.
