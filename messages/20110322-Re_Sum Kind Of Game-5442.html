This is a game for two players.
Start with an n-by-n grid drawn on paper, where n is even.

Players take turns placing numbers into the empty grid squares, one
number per move.
Player 1 places into the grid a 1 then a 2 then 3 then... then the
value of n^2/2-1 then finally the value of n^2/2.
Player 2, on the other hand, goes the opposite way, placing into the
grid the value of n^2/2 then the value of n^2/2-1 then... then 3 then
a 2 and finally a 1.

Player 1 gets as a score the number of squares with integers S where
each is the sum of the values in two different squares of the same ROW
(same row as their sum S).

Player 2 gets as a score the number of squares with integers S where
each is the sum of the values in two different squares of the same
COLUMN (same column as their sum S).

(The addends can be the same value, but must be in different squares.)

It doesn't matter who wrote down each number as far as scoring is
concerned.

Largest score wins.

Sample game: (n=6)

01 02 03 04 05 18
12 17 05 15 11 10
10 14 13 17 03 06
09 14 06 04 09 02
08 16 07 15 08 12
16 18 07 13 11 01

Player 1 gets for each row (top to bottom):
3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1
11 points.

Player 2 gets for each column (left to right):
2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2
11 points.

(I may have made a mistake or two figuring these out.)

A tie, if I didn't err.

----

Is there a bias in favor of one player in the game because strategies
are different due to the two orders the numbers are placed into the
grid?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

Without playing it, I intuitively think the increasing (1,2,3,...)
player has an advantage. The reason is that while both players can
play off the other's moves, the increasing player can make scores off
of just his own moves after the 3rd placement (since 1+2=3), but the
decending player has to wait until half-way through the game to do the
same. The lower numbers are almost certainly more useful, and by the
time the decending player can use them, the grid will be very
restrictive.
