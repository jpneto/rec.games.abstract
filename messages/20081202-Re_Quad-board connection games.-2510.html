Atoll/Loophole generalizes only the GOAL of Hex.
Generalizing the CONNECTIVITY of Hex by using a non-hex and/or a
non-trivalent board is equally valid. It is unrelated to generalizing the
goal.
You seem to assert without making an argument that the goal of the game is
more intrinsic to hex than the geometry of the board and the connectivity of
the pieces.
 &gt; Alternative tessellations for connection games have long been
 &gt; established.
I didn't say or imply otherwise. However, non-trivalent grids have generally
been ignored. The point of my post was that by using the first come, first
connected rule (FCFC), Hex, Y and other games can be ported to ANY
tessellation, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not merely those that are trivalent<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. Non-trivalent grids
have been overlooked or used only with extra rules to deal with deadlocks
that change them from pure connection games -- Onyx for example -- or change
the underlying geometry back to trivalent -- Quax and Zen for example. By
adding the obvious FCFC rule to Hex, Y and a myriad of other games, play on
Cairo, Square, Triangular and other tessellations without deadlocks or draws
is enabled.

Nothing in the ordinal rules of Hex, Y or Atoll implies that non-hex grids
are included. This goes triple for non-trivalent grids, which <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>clearly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
weren't even hinted at by the original rules of Hex or Atoll.
Both Piet Hein and John Nash defined the game Hex (aka Con-Tac-Tix aka
Polygon aka Nash aka John, etc) as being played on a rhombus shaped board of
hexagons (or its dual) with exactly 4 goal areas. A game -- say Anyboard Hex
-- defined with all the rules of Hex with the addition of giving the players
choice swapping a hex board for any non-hexagonal and/or non-trivalent
tilings is by definition a generalization of Hex.
For any two related concepts, A and B; A is considered a generalization of
concept B if and only if:
�	every instance of concept B is also an instance of concept A; and
�	there are instances of concept A which are not instances of concept B.
Hex is an instance of Anyboard Hex, and Anyboard Hex includes games other
than standard Hex; therefore Anyboard Hex is one (of an infinite number of)
generalization(s) of Hex.
It seems that your use of the word "generalization" is at odds with common
usage in the abstract games community, computer science community and the
mathematical world.
The use of the words "generalized" and "generalization of ..." in this sense
(as in "generalized chess" and "generalized tic-tac-toe or gomoku" ) in
abstract games goes back many decades.

There is precisely one generalization of Hex: a combination of generalized
Atoll and generalized Loophole.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
An assertion without support. Claiming there is only one possible
generalization of ANYTHING is absurd.
 &gt; Hex is the trivial, special case of "Atoll-Loophole"
Hex is also a special case of an infinite number of possible
generalizations.
To illustrate:
A) The game of Hex was defined by both Nash and Hein as being played on a
field of hexagons.
B) Define �Anyboard Trivalent Hex� as Hex with one added rule -- players
create any trivalent board.
C) Define �Anyboard Hex� as Hex with one added rule -- players create any
board. If it is non-trivalent, the FCFC rule is used.
D) Insert rules for generalized Atoll/Loophole.
Using the rules of either B, C or D, players may decide to use a standard
11x11 rhombus of hexagons with the standard four edges as goals. The result
is the same, standard game of Hex -- a special case of any of the three
generalizations. Each ruleset allows a different but overlapping set of
possible games to be played. Combine the generalizations of C and D  and you
get a broader generalization of Hex.

And if it makes you happy you can play Atoll-Loophole on an unlimited
variety of tessellations, although that does nothing to further generalize
what was already a tessellation independent game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Quoting your published rules for Atoll: "...a two player game played on a
hexagonal pattern grid."
Quoting your published rules for Loophole 2D: "... a two player game played
on an hexagonal patterned rhombus..."
Neither Hex as it was originally published nor Atoll as you have written it
are tessellation independent. You might as well say Go and Chess are
tessellation independent -- both of which have been ported to other
tessellations.
