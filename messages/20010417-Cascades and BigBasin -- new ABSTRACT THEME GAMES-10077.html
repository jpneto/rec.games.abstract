Cascades and BigBasin

For some time now (a few months) I have been toying with the idea of
trying to model/abstract the flow of water carving out a mountainside.
A related geometric pattern is the fractal on certain seashells.  I may
have started thinking about this after reading the following description
of Craige Schensted's Star on Mark Thompson's web site:

[R. Wayne Schmittberger on his adaptation:] "Maxi-Star places perhaps too
much emphasis on the center in the early going, but later on, edge play
gets quite interesting, as each player tries to undermine the other's
biggest star by scooping out territory underneath it."
(For full quote see  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/star.html">http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/star.html</a>)

The image in my mind is a root-pattern forming or tributaries of a river.
The Gigamic game of stacking pencil-like sticks to see who has the longest
chain (name escapes me, and I can no longer find it on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.gigamic.com">www.gigamic.com</a>)
was possibly another inspiration.  Then Greg Van Patton's web page on
bridging Hex and Go (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.rpi.edu/~vanpag/GoHex.html">http://www.rpi.edu/~vanpag/GoHex.html</a>) struck a real
chord and inspired me to codify some simple mechanics, whereas earlier
I had been merely accumulating great-sounding game names of a watery nature
:-)  This is very much a work-in-progress as I believe the theme is rich
enough for a great many games that are surprisingly complex to play,
despite having a simple basic idea at the core.  Your help is requested to
refine these games!

       o x o x o x         (1) Double-move -- x places one stone, then
      . . . . . . .            players alternate placing up to two stones.
     . . . . . . . .       (2) Each stone is placed next to and below a
    . . . . . . . . .          stone of the same color.
   . . . . . . . . . .     (3) Player who occupies more of the bottom-most
  . . . . . . . . . . .        row wins.

The game couldn't be simpler or quicker to play, but I haven't "figured
it out" after several games.  The next variant would allow a stone to be
placed at the same level as a friendly stone (2A).  A more chaotic variant
requires only adjacency to a stone of either color (2B), but a stone cut
off from receiving (downward or sideways) "flow" is immediately removed
(similar idea as Greg's).  Finally, stones can be placed anywhere (2C).
I call this series of games Cascades.

After the bottom row is filled, the game can be continued where the
board progressively <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>narrows<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> instead of widens.  This variant can also
be arranged in a ring with a predetermined starting position and stones
(dry streambeds?) flowing toward a central "lake" (which may even be
empty, in which case whoever occupies the center wins).

  . . . . . . . . . . .           x o x o
   . . . . . . . . . .           o . . . x     Too small
    . . . . . . . . .           x . . . . o    of a board!
     . . . . . . . .           o . .   . . x
      . . . . . . .             x . . . . o
       . . . . . .               o . . . x
        . . . . .                 x o x o

I have named this game BigBasin, after a local mountain formation in
Northern California.  (It could have been called Tahoe or something.)
I think more work needs to be done here than in Cascades.

Regarding a long-standing discussion in rec.games.board on what to call
the recent run of "German" games (Alan Moon suggested "designer games")
-- I'd call them "abstract theme games".  While all games try to abstract
a natural or social phenomenon into a simplified, recognizable pattern,
the German games do a better job of presenting both the abstraction and
the theme, than most earlier "American" games (abstract or themed but
seldom both).  The best example of an abstract theme game is probably
chess; 1,000 years ago the answer may have been Go/WeiQi but that game's
theme has gone with the wind...

The family of games I call Cascades and BigBasin are attempts at creating
an abstract theme game based on a ubiquitous pattern, the flow of water.

Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated,
