I won't comment here on people who are banned from this site 
[i.e. Mark Steere], only thank Omar and Whatever Divine 
Authority may be involved, for the ban.

Christian, come back to r.g.a and we can discuss this like gentlemen.  Take your testosterone supplement and come out from under Omar Syed's burka.  You can't be comfortable with his sweaty balls resting on your forehead.

A few thinkers about abstract games ... 
Others, who are perfectly free to reply, may be mentioned 
though, like Benedikt Rosenau, reluctant [wonder why, lol] 
co-author of Symple, who thinks it wise to ignore persistent 
attacks on the game, because the attacker is like terminator, 
not to be be reasoned with and absolutely unstoppable. So 
[Mark Steere] may well be right to keep silent while being 
pissed on. I won't because I'm too pissed off.

Your swollen prostate restricted urine dribble certainly is frightening, Christian.  But you're pissing into the wind - the same breeze that wafts your old man flatulence.

Then there's Luis Bolaños Mures, in my view the best game 
designer at the moment.

I'll buy that.  You had your time, I had my time, and now it's Luis' time.  What's the problem?  :D

Mark Steere has Oust, but basically (p)re-invented the game 
several times, and never better, in Tanbo, Flume, Redstone 
and Rive. Flume is a perfect little game, 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No game is perfect, Christian.  Not even mine  :)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
but it relates to Oust a bit as Othello does to Go: not quite 
that organic and not at all the same league. Luis' Ayu however 
is no less quintessential than Oust, and neither are his 
innovative twin games Xodd and Yodd. So I have high expectations 
of him.

As do I.

Finite games really do rule, Christian.  When will you realize that? :D

Actually I'm not sure about Nick Bentley who's best game, by 
his own admission, is Ketchup, but whose other games seem to 
fail to compete with that game's quality and appeal. Why would 
someone praise Corey Clark's Slither to heaven? Among square 
connection games it is an outstanding game. But 'square connection' 
isn't exactly a grand theme, 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think it's grand.  The square board poses the problem of enemy chains crossing each other.  Slither provides an elegant solution, and it's a well thought of game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
like checkmate 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh, checkmate.  Tie me down.  Was there ever a more formulaic, oft repeated goal?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
or elimination or territory. And Slither uses a pie for balance, 
where it doesn't work, unless the board is so big that it doesn't 
matter in the first place. So it's a great game, but nothing to 
get carried away about. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Not for you, Christian.  You only get carried away with your own games.  

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I had been wondering about that. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Me too.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And about the fact that Ketchup went from version 1.0 to 5.0 
and then back to 4.0 because 5.0 in retrospect "wasn't an 
improvement". Now I'm starting to see a pattern. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Kinda like the pattern of:
1. Symple, the perfect game! :D
2. (Oops, tweak.)
3. NOW Symple is perfect! :D
4. Go to step 2.

The price of perfection, I suppose.  Christian, you started with a parameter of 2 in Symple.  Then you changed it to 4 or greater.  Now recently you changed it again to 6 or greater.  May I suggest the next Symple tweak?  HOW ABOUT 8 OR GREATER????  You're welcome.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Nick questioned the balancing mechanism for Redstone, but later 
called the game a viciously good invention. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Got that right.  Thanks Nick.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Redstone is not a Go variant but an elimination game using Go 
mechanics, and I can reassure Nick: it doesn't need a balancing 
mechanism. The rules suggest a pie. A pie presumes that you can 
judge the value of an initial move. Jugging the value of an 
initial move presumes a general idea of the relation between 
strategy and tactics. In Redstone this relation is evasive to 
the point of being invisible. The strategic goal is way off and 
the global impact of the outcome of local fights is unpredictabe.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Blah blah blah blah blah.  Holy shit, what a gas bag.

 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Strategy is hard to find and tactics serve themselves. And despite 
Redstone's finitude a game can seem to take no end. I can see that 
almost at a glance, but Nick apparently is blinded by simplicity of
concept
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Everyone is blind but you, Christian, because you're...

- a necessary condition for a good game, but not a sufficient one. 
It surprises me because Nick's criteria for what makes a good game 
are are very well thought through. Barring other reasons for his 
praise of Redstone, I'd say he values the right concepts, but lacks 
the intuition to see how they might pan out in an actual game. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course.  Nick lacks intuition because he isn't...

Redstone sucks, but it may take determined supporters a while to 
find that out. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course, Christian.  Someday everyone will come to their senses and realize that Redstone sucks.  And they'll also realize what a "great game" Symple is.  Then they'll get down on their knees and beg your forgiveness for ever doubting that Symple is "perfectly balanced" (lol), and that it has "nowhere to go but deeper" (into the sewer system).  Have you ever considered, Christian, that maybe you're just...

Barring Benedikt they're the only contributors to (and account for 
50% of the visitors of) rec.games.abstract, a self declared 
'nonsense-free forum' dedicated to cyclophobia and finitude. Read 
that again and see the irony Wink . 

... and what they have in common 
But including Benedikt they're all concerned with abstract strategy 
for the sake of it. They're not the only ones of course, yet most
inventors are in the business of game inventing to market 
particular games, and that's a perfectly respectable object, but 
not in the least interesting for those who want a game to be a 
mental sports weapon that would last, if not for centuries, then at 
least for the foreseeable future.
