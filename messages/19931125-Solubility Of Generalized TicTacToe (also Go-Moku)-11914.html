 In a recent post about the solution of Go-Moku, the writer
wrote that since the game was solved for a 15x15 board, it
was thus solved for the 19x19. At first this seemed
intuitively obvious: if you can form a row of 5 on a board
of some fixed size, you can do the same on any bigger board.
However, after thinking for a while I became less convinced.
Although the larger board gives you more freedom, it also
gives your opponent the same freedom. Is it not possible that
at some stage in the strategy, a move will create a position
which allows the 2nd player to take the initiative and at 
least force a draw. 
 The general game, forming a row of k on a board of size n,
is obviously either a first player win, or a draw, but
how can you be sure a winning strategy extends to a larger
board?

 As a simple example, suppose k=3, n=4, the first player
should easily win. Suppose the board is labelled as
columns 1234, rows ABCD as: 1 2 3 4
                          A
                          B
                          C
                          D 

 Then, if player 1 (call him/her X) plays D1 
          player 2 (Y) plays B3 
          X's strategy to this reply is C1
          Y plays B1 (forced)
          X plays B2 (forced)
          Y plays A3 (forced)
          X plays C3 (forced)

          and X now obviously wins.

 However on a 5x5 board, the game goes (X using the same 
strategy) as follows:

          N.B. Board is as 1 2 3 4 5
                          A
                          B
                          C
                          D 
                          E

         X: E1
         Y: C3
         X: D1 
         Y: C1 (forced) 
         X: C2 (forced) 
         Y: B3 (forced)

         And now Y will win.


 This is a very simple example, no doubt X can win using
some strategy that works on both the 4x4 and 5x5, BUT 
THIS STRATEGY DOESN'T WORK.

 So how do we KNOW that strategies will work for larger
boards?
