DURAK (Russian for "Stupid"): A Russian card game of strategy:

Object: not to loose.  There is no single winner, but there is a single 
looser.
The last player with cards in hand is the looser.  The game involves some 
luck but mostly
strategy.  Like in chess, each player may develop his or her own style of 
playing.

Players: Three to Five or Six players, usually Four (4).

Preparing the Deck:  There are several variations of this game depending 
on how many players,
and the general level of expertise.  For large groups (5 or 6 players) 
and/or beginners usually the
whole deck is used.  For a smaller group and/or a faster game a smaller 
deck is used.
Large deck: Use one deck of 52 cards.  Remove the Jokers.  
	Card values in ascending order: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A trump.
Small deck: (preferable) Use one deck of 52 cards.  Remove the Jokers, as 
well as all the cards
of a face value of five or less (except the Aces).
	Card values in ascending order: 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A trump.

Preparation:  Except for the first game of the evening, the looser of the 
previous game is the
dealer.  
1. Shuffle the cards.  
2. The dealer asks the person to his left to cut the deck.  Optional: [If 
this is not the first game of
the evening, the player may opt not to cut the deck by saying "Nye 
snimayu shapkee Doo-rah-
kam" ("I do not tip my hat to idiots").  The dealer must go around the 
table asking for people to
cut the deck.  If all refuse, the dealer cuts the deck.]  
3. If the small deck is used, deal six (6) cards to each player.  If the 
large deck is used deal
seven (usually) or six (rarely) cards to each player depending on general 
agreement.
4. After the players have received all their cards, reveal the top card 
of the deck.  Place is on the
middle of the table, place the deck on top of the revealed card, covering 
it half way.  This card
represents the trump suit as is now at the bottom of the deck.  Cards in 
this suit hold a higher
value then the Aces of the other suits.  Within the trump suit card 
hierarchy is maintained. 
Optional:  [Before game play begins the player who holds a 2 (large deck) 
or 6 (small deck) of
the trump suit in their hand may opt to exchange their card for the 
revealed trump card.  This
may only be done before the game begins].

Game Play:  
1. The game consists of a series of attacks (where players get a chance 
to get rid of cards) and
defenses (where players are threatened with having to add cards to their 
hand unless of course
they are succesful in defending themselves).  
2. Each player gets a turn to defend himself.  As players are eliminated 
from the game, the order
of defenders must be maintained.  (see below**).
3. The first attacker is the player on the left of the dealer (dealer 
attacks last).  The defender is
the player to the left of the attacker.  Game play procedes clockwise.
4. There are three common variations in DURAK: a. Pros-toy (simple), b. 
Pod-kid-noy (under
hand), and c. Pe-re-vod-noy (pass the buck).  b. Podkidnoy is the most 
popular.  This variation
will be described in the main body of the rules.  The rules for the other 
two variations will
descibed in the Variations section.

Attacking:  
1. Attacker reveals a card from his hand by placing it on the table so 
all can see.  Hint A*.
2. After the first card has been defended all players become attackers 
and may add cards to the
table as long as they are of the same face value as other cards in play.  
Hint B*.
3. Maximum cards to be defended must be as many as have been originally 
dealt to each player
(6 or 7) or until the defender runs out of cards, whichever is less.

Defending:  
1. Defender must respond to the revealed card by beating it with a card 
of the same suit of higher
value or a card of the trump suit.  Hint C*. Hint D*.
2. If the defender has no appropriate card he must pick up the card and 
add it to his hand,
thereby loosing his turn to attack.  If the defender picks up the first 
attacking card, the turn is
over.  
3. If the defender beats the first card, all other players may join in as 
attackers.  
4. Defender must beat all revealed cards.  Otherwise he must pick all 
cards in play including ones
that have been beaten.  Hint E*.
5. Maximum cards to be defended must be as many as have been originally 
dealt to each player
(6 or 7) or until the defender runs out of cards, whichever is less.
6. A successful turn ends when the defender beats all attacking cards.  
All cards that have been
revealed during this turn are removed from the game.  

End of Turn:
1.  When a defender has successfully beaten all the attacking cards, all 
the cards that have been
in play are removed from the game.
2.  Every player must take his turn to refresh his hand by taking as many 
cards from deck as
needed to bring his hand to a total of as many as have been originally 
dealt to each player (6 or
7).  The original attacker refreshes his hand first.  All other attackers 
follow in clockwise order. 
Defender refreshes his hand last.  Hint F*.
3.  If the deck has been exhausted, players who are left empty handed 
withdraw from the game. 
They are lucky, for they will not have a chance to loose.
4.  The player who completed a successful defence becomes the next 
attacker against the player
to his left.  If the defender was not successful, the player to his left 
becomes the attacker.  Hint
G*.

End of Game:
End of game begins as soon as the deck is exhausted and there are no more 
cards to refresh
one's hand.  As cards and players are eliminated, strategy becomes much 
more important than
luck.  The last two players battle out their fates, until one player 
remains with cards in hand.  This
player is the "Durak" and the dealer of the next game.  (There have been 
games where there
was no looser:  When two players remain each holding one card.  The 
attacker reveals his card. 
The defender happens to be able to beat it.  The game is over without a 
looser.  But this happens
very rarely.)

Variations:
a. Prostoy (simple).  The rules are the same as above, except that each 
turn consists of one
attacker, and one defender.  Other players do not get a chance to attack 
once the first card has
been beaten.  They only watch until it is their turn to be attacker or 
defender.  This variation is
usually played only for didactic reasons.
c. Prevodnoy (pass the buck).  The rules are the same as Prostoy with one 
addition.  If a
defender finds that he has a card of the same value as the attacker has 
placed on the table, he
places that card down and passes off both cards to the player on his left 
to defend.  This variation
is rarely played.
d. Podkidnoy-Perevodnoy (underhand and pass the buck).  This variation is 
popular with children
and is much sillier than plain Podkidnoy.  The rules are the same as 
Podkidnoy (described in the
main body of the rules) with the same addition as in (c.).  If a defender 
(Misha) finds that he has a
card of the same value as the attacker (Tanya) has placed on the table, 
he places that card
down and passes off both cards to the player on his left (Boris) to 
defend.  Each new defender
(Boris) must attept to beat all cards on the table.  However new attacking 
cards may be placed on
the table only after all the passed cards have been beaten.  The 
possibility exists that the third
player may pass the buck as well... and even the fourth player...

**) Regarding Order of Defenders:  Perhaps the most difficult aspect of 
the game to get used
to is that turns are based on order of defenders.  This becomes important 
in the end game when
players are eliminated.  
1. Players are eliminated in two ways:
	a. Either an attacker used his last card, 
	b. or a defender has successfully beaten all cards on the table 
and is left empty handed. 
In the first case, game play procedes in an obvious manner.  In the 
second case, game play is
not necessarily as obvious.  
2. When the defender is left empty handed (Misha), successfully 
completing his turn, it would
normally be his turn to attack.  However the deck has been exhausted.  
The player on his left
(Boris) does not get a free ride, however.  The player to the new 
defender(Boris)'s right who
is still in play is the attacker (Tanya).  This often means that a player 
(Tanya) gets to attack
twice in a row: first against the player who has just been eliminated 
(Misha), and second against
the new defender (Boris).

Hints:
Hint A*: Preferably this is an unwanted card, usually one of low value, 
but not necessarily.
Hint B*: You may want to collect cards of the same value to increase the 
punch of an attack.
Hint C*: Defender may want to keep trump cards to the end of the game, 
but not necessarily. 
Hint D*: By defending with a trump of the same face value, the defender 
minimizes the risk of
		further attacks.
Hint E*: Picking up the first card can sometimes be a wise move.
Hint F*: If a player has enough cards there is no need to refresh the hand.
Hint G*: As a player your goal is to keep the person to your immediate 
right from defending
successfully, and to help the person two spaces for your right from 
loosing a turn.
