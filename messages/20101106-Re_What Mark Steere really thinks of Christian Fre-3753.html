For the record, I admire Christian Freeling.  He's an intellectual.  He's
not a dope like you Clark.

Yes I roast Christian from time to time, but I'm only doing my job.  A taxi
driver doesn't toot his horn and insist you go first.  He has a job to do.
If I went too easy on Christian, people would talk.

Yeah people would talk. They'd say, hey what the fuck's going on here?
Mark Steere's not be a miserable asshole. Wow, maybe he's not such a
bad guy after all. Mark I got a job for you. Your new job is to make
games and post them here and fuck off the other 364 days of the year.
You start tomorrow 8:30, sharp! tic toc tic toc
