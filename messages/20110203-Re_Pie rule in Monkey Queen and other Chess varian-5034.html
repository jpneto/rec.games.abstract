The discussion is rooted in what you would call "the
game". If "Chess-as-is" is meant, yes then other initial
positions will prevent you from exploring the depth of
"the game".

Exactly.  In a relatively uniform, combinatorial style Chess variant such as
Monkey Queen, restricting the first move to a narrow range of choices,
possibly even one choice via the pie rule, you're still left with
essentially the same game starting from move 2.  The only major difference
is that there's no longer a significant initial advantage.

The first move doesn't have to be "perfectly balanced", even if there were
such a move, which there isn't in a finite-conclusive game.  The first move
has only to be not wildly favorable to Player 1 if there's to be any hope of
fair play.  To me, in my opinion or philosophy or whatever, fair play is a
must.  I have to do the best I can in creating fair play.

The question would be the one you've asked several
times yourself: are there bad first moves? That may
differ from game to game, but generally speaking there
may be something of a shortage there.

If there's one fair first move, i.e. slightly disadvantageous to Player 1,
there's no shortage.  All you need is one.  I believe that moving the queen
directly forward one square in Monkey Queen is disadvantageous.  Moving
directly forward two or three squares would be better, and might still be
slightly disadvantageous.

A first move directly forward one square may in fact not be disadvantageous
to Player 1.  I can't know for sure without some sort of analysis.  In any
case, all is not lost.  If said move is slightly advantageous to Player 1,
Player 2 will invoke the pie rule and the game will proceed with Player 2
having a slight advantage.  So Player 2 will have a slight advantage either
way, using the pie rule.

Moving the queen sideways one square on move 1 might be too powerful.  Now
you're casting a double width "beam" all the way across the board, right
next to the board center.
