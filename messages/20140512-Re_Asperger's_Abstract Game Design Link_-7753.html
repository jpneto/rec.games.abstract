I took an online test for Asperger's syndrome a while back and scored well into the "probably has it" range.  It seems like a way higher than normal percentage of us have it (or probably have it).



1. Ed Koch

2. Corey Clark

3. Christian Freeling.  Christian seems too socially well adjusted to have it, but I know very little about Asperger's, and of course I take Christian at his word.  

4. Me?

5. I think there was someone else; I forget now...

Hey Mister Copy-Paste,

Do not try to jusifify your problems by pointing to some disorder disease or anything like that.
You are incompetent! That`s it.
You are not inventive because your lack of culture is too high.
Stop posting games first.
During one year or more try to imagine a new way of playing abstract games. Abstract gamers are playing like robots.
An ideal abstract game is the one where a game player invent new solutions. It is like solving a big puzzle with an infinite number of solutions. In each game the player is challenged by new puzzle and he has to find an elegant solution each time.
Chess players for example are not smart because they are basing their moves on memory. Chess is boring very boring even if the players could play a surprising moves from time to time.
The best abstract game will be soon or later a game with 2 or more players where one is the Phenix (the one who set the puzzle) and the other or others the solvers. And each solution itself is another puzzle for the others.

I will publish this kind of game.
An infinite game with no winner. The only pleasure will be finding the best solution.

Hazen! the buffoon (dixit Mark Steere)
