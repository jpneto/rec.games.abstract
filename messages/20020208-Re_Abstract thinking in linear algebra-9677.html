The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,
understanding cannot be taught in calculus.  Children are able

Could you explain this last sentence, please? It sure seems to be the case

I hope he will forgive me for putting words in his mouth. In the US,
we (well, the societal we, certainly not me) spend an inordinate
amount of time "teaching" our children to compute by hand (add,
subtract, multiply and divide). At one point in the 4th grade
syllabus, the children need to answer 50 randomly chosen
multiplication problems (1 digit by 1 digit) in 5 minutes in order to
move on to the next phase of the syllabus (have to master learning
objective n before you can move on to totally unrelated objective
n+1). They are tested on their ability to multiply 2 and 3 digit
numbers by hand.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is exactly right.  There is no consideration of what
multiplication means, except the obtaining of answers.  The
same is true for addition.

I distinctly remember by 3rd grade "teacher" making me stand in the
corner when I explained that I did, for example, 8 X 4 by turning into
4 X 8 and then 2 X 16 = 32. Like I was excited I'd figured out how
break down multiplication into a binary tree.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I would not call it that, but more the use of commutativity
and associativity, probably combined with knowing that 
2*x = x+x.  Teachers are told how to teach, but do not 
understand what they are doing.  They do not even learn 
that there can be more than one way to calculate something.

And probably the worst travesty is that this stuff is called "math"

I think thats partially because there are more primary grade teachers
who are liberal arts leaning then math/science oriented. To them
"computation" is "math". They never got to the point of seeing the
beauty of real math.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is worse than that.  Many high school mathematics teachers
are often almost as bad.  They cannot understand that mathematics
does not consist of definitions and formulas and algorithms to
be slavishly followed.

Writing a computer program takes some organization of thought and
basic logic.  Thats not a bad skill.
