On further reflection, a simpler and possibly better formulation of
the game.  First I'll give the rules, then I'll speculate on why it
might be better.

Rules:
1)	Starting with player 1, the players take turns.
2)	On his turn, a player must place a stone of either color onto any
empty space.
3)	The game ends when board is full.
4)	If the 2nd-largest black group is bigger than the 2nd largest white
group, then player 1 wins.  Player 2 wins otherwise.  (If the board
contains only one group of a given color, that colors 2nd largest
group is said to be zero.)

Note: if two or more groups of the same color are tied for nth-
largest group of that color, then one is arbitrarily considered the
nth largest group of that color, another is considered the (n+1)th
largest, and so on.

Ok, these rules are simpler, and although they may look like they lead
to an unbalanced game, I'm not sure this is so.  Heres why I think
so: Player 1 has the decisive advantage on small boards.  Consider the
7-cell hexhex board.  Player 1 can win easily by placing a white stone
on the central hex (thus ensuring that there will only be one white
group at game's and).  Player 1's advantage springs from the fact that
on small board, he can make it impossible for two white groups to
exist.  As the board size grows, there's an increasing amount of space
to ensure a second white group, and in fact in certain positions the
extra white stone on the board could be a liability for player 1,
since it could allow the 2nd largest white group to be one stone
bigger or the second largest black group to be one stone smaller, or
both.  So as board size grows, player 1's advantage decreases, and
possibly even reverses at some point.  If white's advantages decreases
sufficiently smoothly as board size grows, then there should be some
board size where player 1's advantage is pretty nearly offset by the
"tiebreak" advantage given to player 2 in this new version of the
rules.  If thats the case, it could be that there is symmetry where
it really matters, in the winning chances, even if the goals are
slightly asymmetrical.  Let me know if I've said anything stupid, and
which version of the game you think youd prefer.
