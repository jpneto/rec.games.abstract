Here's the correct Oust tutorial link I should have given before:

Tutorial 1 is very interesting.  It beautifully demonstrates the
counterintuitive nature of Oust play.  Pitting a beginner against a more
advanced player, the beginner kills everything within reach in the opening
game - very typical of beginners.  Oust is a game of annihilation after all,
right?  :)

Later, the more advanced player, "beaten" down to a single stone against an
enemy-covered board fights his way back to win.  We call it growing the
dragon.

Tutorial 1 is not all that contrived.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have come back from an army of
one stone and I've seen it happen.  Not only do you not want to kill
everything within reach (at first), you don't want to kill <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>anything<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> in the
opening.  In fact, you want to force your opponent to capture <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> stones.
 That's how Rod wins most of the time.  Either you capture his stone or some
other shitty thing will happen to you.  So you capture his stones and set
yourself up for annihilation.

Incidently, the single stone does <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> always come back to win.  When you
let your army get too small, it can dwindle down to zero without too much
trouble.

Oust seems to play totally differently between different people at this
stage (hundreds, not thousands of plays).  The first time I played Corey,
after only playing Rod for a long time, the gameplay was startlingly
different.  Like, How can it be this different?  But it was.  Even more so
with Greg van Patten.  He has a particularly unique style.  You can express
yourself in Oust, however unwittingly.  In my case I'm just playing.  But we
all have a style that comes out on the game board.  Or that comes out in new
designs.
