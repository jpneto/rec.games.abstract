Mark Steere's been publicly masturbating again.

Steere posted the following in the Arimaa forum on Oct25th. I guess he
figured he'd do something frightening for Halloween.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Someone suggested that Symple was an "homage" to me.  It does't matter if is or not, but now I feel bad about judging the game too harshly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Rofl a reassuring voice you hear in your head while you're tripping on
drugs does not count as a "someone". Why the fuck would Christian feel
the need to make a game that's an homage to you? I'm sure he's sitting
there with his burmese python straddled over his broad shoulders
thinking "you know what would be great? A game dedicated to the legend
Mark Steere!" You're always telling everyone to pull their heads out
of their asses and I can see why. Apparently you are more than
familiar with the horror of living with your head stuck up your ass.

The minus has to be there because of the balancing rule, but maybe it should be a D- or a C-.  If it's any consolation, I hate two of my own games almost &gt;as much as Symple."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yep everything is copacetic now.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Why am I such a game hater?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Maybe it's because you're just a naturally offensive and unlikeable
person whose misanthropy manifests itself on a daily basis. I dunno,
just throwing that crazy idea out there.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I didn't used to be.  When I first started, I was designing in a total vacuum.  I never played games or knew anyone who did.  I even didn't know what &gt;"abstract strategy games" were.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh I see! Prior to becoming the asshole you are today, there was a
period of ignorance and naivety where you weren't even aware of the
existence of other abstract games? I didn't know such a swell guy
could turn into such a bad egg. I blame the education system.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In my vacuum, the only things that mattered were robustness and architecture - design interest.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Too bad you couldn't have stayed in that vacuum...
