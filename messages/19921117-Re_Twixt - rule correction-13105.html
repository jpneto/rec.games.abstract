The descriptions of Twixt posted so far have all been incomplete.
A move consists of 3 parts -
 1. Place a peg in any free hole,
 2. Remove any of your own bridges,
 3. Place bridges between any two of your own pegs which are a knights
    move apart.

 From the Avalon Hill (Leisure Time) rules: "Before placing a peg, a
player may, if he desires, carefully remove any pegs and links he has
previously placed on the board."  I.e., The order should be:
 1. Remove any of your own structure that you wish.
 2. Place one peg.
 3. Link any of your pegs that are a knight's move apart.

Twixt was invented by Alex Randolph, a prolific inventor of games
(see Sid Sackson's "Gamut of Games"), who introduced it to a group
of artist freinds who used to frequent a Vienese cafe. It has been
produced by several manufacturers, all of whom are required to credit
the inventor (what a good practice).

This is very interesting.  It is also apparently ignored in the
aformentioned Avalon Hill/Leisure Time edition.  I couldn't even find
a copyright date on the rules, much less an inventor's credit.

The other games you mentioned also sound very interesting.  I'll try
them out with some friends next weekend.
