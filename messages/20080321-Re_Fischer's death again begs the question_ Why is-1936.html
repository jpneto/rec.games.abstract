<br>??? Ties are an impossibility for a large number of games and sports.
<br>Is&nbsp; it your claim that all of these contests are unfair?
<br>
<br>In many other sports, ties are a theoretical possibility, but rare. In those
<br>where they are possible and not so rare (though still far rarer than
<br>chess), e.g. soccer, many have taken steps exactly as proposed for
<br>chess (alternate scoring that devalues ties).
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>You still aren't
<br>demonstrating that draws are bad or that most people don't like them.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Much like we don't debate the merits of breathing oxygen. The very fact that
<br>chess' draw situation is an extreme compared with almost every other
<br>human contest should tell you something.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br>If I'm playing a komi in Go I usually make it an integer where draws are
<br>specifically made possible.&nbsp; All I'd have to do to take out all
<br>possibility of a draw is add a half point to the komi, but I (and my
<br>friends at the Go club) don't see the point.&nbsp; We don't see any necessity
<br>or advantage in requiring a decisive result.
<br></blockquote>
<br>According to Wikipedia "Conventional komi in most competitions is a 
half-integer....
<br>This is convenient and the prevailing usage for tournaments, since it rules out 
a tied
<br>game and rematches."
<br>
<br>I suspect that even with your integer komi, draw rates are nowhere near as
<br>high as the cancer it has become in high-level chess.
<br>
<br>You sound like a Go enthusiast trying to kill off chess.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Who said I was only interested in the bottom line?&nbsp; I'm interested in
<br>robust games (again, not including Chess).
<br></blockquote>
<br>Your value of "robust" isn't necessarily global though.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Let's take it to the extreme and imagine that instead of 80% draws
<br>among experts, you have 100% draws among intermediate players.&nbsp; Not
<br>too farfetched since games like that do exist.&nbsp; Would you find that
<br>entertaining?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Let's take it to reality and note that that doesn't happen in Chess,
<br>which is the subject of this discussion, so your "point" is rather
<br>lacking any, errr, point.
<br>
<br>Pete.
