The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,
understanding cannot be taught in calculus.  Children are able
to understand mathematical concepts until this ability is
destroyed by imitating computers.

Could you explain this last sentence, please? It sure seems to be the case
that learning mathematics is easier for young children than for older
children,
but what does 'imitating computers' have to do with that?

I hope he will forgive me for putting words in his mouth. In the US,
we (well, the societal we, certainly not me) spend an inordinate
amount of time "teaching" our children to compute by hand (add,
subtract, multiply and divide). At one point in the 4th grade
syllabus, the children need to answer 50 randomly chosen
multiplication problems (1 digit by 1 digit) in 5 minutes in order to
move on to the next phase of the syllabus (have to master learning
objective n before you can move on to totally unrelated objective
n+1). They are tested on their ability to multiply 2 and 3 digit
numbers by hand.

I distinctly remember by 3rd grade "teacher" making me stand in the
corner when I explained that I did, for example, 8 X 4 by turning into
4 X 8 and then 2 X 16 = 32. Like I was excited I'd figured out how
break down multiplication into a binary tree.

And probably the worst travesty is that this stuff is called "math"
and not "computation".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think thats partially because there are more primary grade teachers
who are liberal arts leaning then math/science oriented. To them
"computation" is "math". They never got to the point of seeing the
beauty of real math.

Writing a computer program takes some organization of thought and
basic logic.  Thats not a bad skill.
