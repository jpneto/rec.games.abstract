	I think there is some confusion here... the games "sprouts" and
"drago" have been described by M. Gardner in one of his monthly
collaborations with Scientific American, and also published as books
(sorry, I do not remember the references and I have not handy neither
the book nor the magazines).

	The game described by <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mpf@theory.lcs.mit.edu">mpf@theory.lcs.mit.edu</a> (Michael P. Frank) is
"drago" (for those curious about this name, "drago" is the name of a
tree from the Canary Islands). "sprouts" is similar, with the only
difference that dots are replaced by crosses. Every arm of the cross
can eventually become the start of an edge. When an edge is drawn from
one cross to another cross, a small segment is to be added crossing
the segment: thus, when connecting the first cross with the second
cross, an intermediate cross is generated:

	
	+-----------------+--------------------+

   ^				  ^					   ^
First cross     Intermediate        Second Cross

	Further edges must be added departing from the existent crosses.
	Well, this game is much simpler than "drago", and winning
strategies are known. Check M. Gardner's articles.

I am fairly certain the original name of the game with dots and three
lives/dot was "sprouts", and the original name of the game with crosses and
four lives/cross was "Brussels sprouts". Certainly this is how they were
named in Martin Gardner's original Scientific American article on the games,
from some time in the 1960s or possibly the early 1970s.

Your statement that winning strategies are known in what you call sprouts
and I call Brussels sprouts is somewhat misleading. I believe that part of
the reason why it was called Brussels sprouts is that it is a bit of a joke
game: it can be proved fairly easily that a game of it with N initial
crosses <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>always<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> lasts <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>exactly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> 5N-2 moves.

So in the normal form of the game (first player unable to play loses) the
first player is certain to win if N is odd and to lose if N is even, no
matter how he or his opponent plays! If you've got a winning position, the
winning strategy is simply "play any move you like". If you've got a losing
position, you can't even hope that your opponent will make a silly
mistake...

So the only real strategy involved in this game is how to make certain that
you get to choose either the initial number of crosses or which player
starts, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the other of them has been determined!
