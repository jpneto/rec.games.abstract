  has anyone ever thought of leaving the world of procedural gaming and maybe
  design a game, which is of a declarative nature?

As far as game instructions go, they appear to be rather declarative
in specifying the rules as opposed to the explicit procedures.  The
rules are interpreted by the players who try to find the solution to
winning the game given the current state of the game.

Game playing programs seem to work better when rule-driven.

Now there may be a difference between the rules of the game and the
game itself, or the play of the game.  How is that you see current
games as procedural, and what would a declarative game be in contrast?
Please clarify.
