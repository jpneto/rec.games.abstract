Hey, anyone have a lead on this? I would like to get pieces of the
Capablanca chess variety (Knight-Rook, Knight-Bishop), but my search
on the web has come up empty. Anyone have any possible leads here on
this?

I found <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>this<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> link:

which also explains why Yasir Seirawan chose new names for the
Princess and Empress, calling them the Elephant and the Hawk. He
wanted something that he could trademark and license to these people.

Part of my wondering about variant pieces, is that, in conversations
with the Seirawan group, they only want their pieces to be used with
his game, not adopted anywhere else.  This ends up leaving the chess
variant community left hanging, and why I was asking this question.  I
do wish the Seirawan group well, and hope their game gets a
following.  IAGO, etc... will still press on here, and my quest to get
variant pieces for the community use (generic) will still be sought
out.  As of this point Seirawan chess, unfortunately, won't be having
anything to do with IAGO, despite my desire otherwise.

As a temporary solution, I will be using PlunderChess pieces for this
purpose.  The designer of the game doesn't mind them being uses as
Capablanca style pieces.  I am going to see if I can find some other
option for this.  If I find an answer I will post it here.
