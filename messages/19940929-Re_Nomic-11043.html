What an interesting post! I wonder if the author has ever participated
in an Internet Nomic game? I have been involved in NetNomic since about
August 1992 in two separate games, first as co-founder of Nomic World,
the first experiment with NetNomic, and more recently (and still) in
Agora Nomic, an e-mail game.

In a way I suppose it's true that Agora Nomic is "sort of academic".
Although there are no turns (players just propose things and we all vote
on them as they come up), there certainly is a lot of poring over Rules,
inventing cunning and devious legal interpretations, devising
interesting legislation of one's own and then shepherding it through
the voting process to get it adopted, and much much more besides. The
total effect, at least for this Nomic addict, is a singularly stimulating
one. Given essentially no time restrictions, the game opens right up
and a limitless field of possibilities opens up with it. I am constantly
amazed that even after two years, the game continues to throw up new
phenomena. At present, for example, we are tentatively looking into
forming official relationships between the various Nomic and Nomic-like
games. On the agenda are such things as dual citizenship and economic
ties. Writing good legislation for this will be quite challenging, not
to mention the prospect of negotiating with delegations from other
Nomics!

In short, I think klaus is a little quick to write of NetNomic as lacking
in interest - but then it all depends on what you like. I've played
Nomic a few times around the dinner table with friends, but it never
seemed to quite take off. Maybe it also depends on who your friends are,
hey? :-)

Anyway, that's enough from me. If you're interested in our game or any 
of the others being played at the moment, I've just yesterday reposted
the Nomic FAQ to this Group. I'll try to remember to do it again periodically.
It's a good place to start. Or, start your own game! The more individual
Nomic games there are, the more interesting foreign policy will be!

Ciao!
