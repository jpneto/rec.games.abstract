&lt;Ad for a website is deleted&gt;

Unless you can grasp why the question was originally asked, and
understand its importance, I don't think your website you are spamming
for now is relevant to the discussion.

If the entire chess world goes and spreads itself among 200+ different
websites, then you don't have any basis to create anything to get the
attention of the media at all.  Without this attention, then you get
ignored.  This, in turn, causes the youth to ignore your game, and the
game goes into decline.  That is an important issue.

But shoot, go ahead and ignore this issue and be a vulture, picking
off some people here to visit your website, so you can get your 15
minutes of notice.
