More than 15 years ago i invented this simple children's game:

Ein-Auge ("one eye")

 1. The game is played on a board with 5x5=25 squares.
 2. At the beginning of the game the board is empty.
 3. Each of the two players has 12 stones (take Draughts men). One player
    has black stones, the other white stones.
 4. White begins.
 5. During the first phase of the game each player, at his turn, places
    a stone on an empty square.
 6. After all stones are on the board the second phase begins.
 7. Then there is only one empty square left which is  called the "eye".
 8. During the second phase each player is moving one of his stones unto
    the eye. You may only move orthogonally. Diagonal moves are not
    allowed.
 9. A player who has a legal move, must move.
10. If a player cannot move, he passes.
11. If your opponent must pass, you do a second move. However, you are not
    allowed to move the same stone as you did before your opponent had to
    pass. So if you do two consecutive moves, you must move two different
    stones.
12. The goal is to have four stones of your color in an orthogonal row. It
    doesn't matter if this happens in the first or the second phase of
    the game. The first player who gets four of his stones in an
    orthogonal row wins. Diagonal rows doesn't matter.
13. A player who has five of his stone in an orthogonal row has lost the
    game.
14. Repetition of moves is a draw.
