  [interesting game description deleted]

  My father-in-law and I have played a somewhat similar game, using 2 chess
  kings, a supply of pennies, and half of a standard chess board (4x8). 
  The starting square was 1 diagonal step in from the corners. A move 
  consisted of moving the king (like a chess king), then placing a penny
  anywhere. Squares with a penny could not be moved to by either side.
  Last side to move wins. It's a fun game.

  I'll have to ask him whether he learned it, or made it up.
