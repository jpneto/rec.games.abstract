 &gt;As someone once said "pawns are the soul of chess".  Chessgamon as
 &gt;proposed would make pawns relatively worthless except as blocking
 &gt;pieces.  So here is a proposed alternative dice roll scheme:
 
 &gt;	1 any P
 &gt;	2 N or NP (b or g pawn)
 &gt;	3 B or BP (c or f pawn)
 &gt;	4 R or RP (a or h pawn)
 &gt;	5 Q or QP (d pawn)
 &gt;	6 K or KP (e pawn)
 
 &gt;I haven't actually played out a game or anything that involved, but it
 &gt;may make it more possible to get a recognizable "pawn structure".

I've had a chance to try this alternate scheme, and I'm not sure I like
it, personally.  Pawns already have about the same relative worth in
chessgammon as in chess (whereas Queens, for example, are probably worth
less in chessgammon).

However, I think using this as an option for each player's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> roll
may improve the game by making it easier to develop pieces.

I welcome more suggestions.  Keep in mind that chessgammon is just the
preliminary result of a straight-forward combination of chess and
backgammon rules, and many improvements are undoubtedly possible.  I
strongly encourage people to try new ideas (hopefully only minor changes
that do not affect the spirit of the game), and please let us know of
experiments you thought were successful.
