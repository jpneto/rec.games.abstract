game quality is thoroughly quantifiable. computers can play games. Let them decide which games are worthy of our consideration. I can guarantee Chess won't bubble to the top, though maybe Go will. the only anthropocentric elements worthy of consideration during the design process are "clarity" and ergonomics. Beyond that the best games are those with the most expansive decision trees. The greatest abstract game ever devised could be played by two people one time while a terrible game could receive a ton of undue attention (as is often the case). Only art needs a public to recognize its worth, abstract games like other mathematical objects derive their essence from their own internal consistency. Not only do mathematics have everything to do with game design they are the ONLY thing that has everything to do with game design. And just because you're not even wrong, doesn't make you right..

I show you the moon and you are pointing out to my finger.
What is you definitive answer to my post : is Connecticut a twisted Twixt? yes or no.
Try to divert the attention by talking about field you know nothing about. La psychologie est une fausse science, de la grosse merde americaine pour l`essentiel.
Using what I call scam-tools like mathematics to intimidate me is laughable..
I`m a mathematician! 
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT MATHEMATICS SO SHUT UP!
