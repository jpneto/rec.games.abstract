Pente is definitely played on a 19x19 board. Like Renju, it differs from
Go-Moku by adding the capture rule. However, Pente isn't the same as Renju
either; there are some minor rule differences, and of course Pente is an
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Americanized<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> version that became popular because it appealed more to
American tastes than the stark renju boards.

Try this variation:  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>KERYO-PENTE<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>  This variation was being played by
expert Pente players back in the days when they had tournaments, and is
very fun. It plays the same as regular Pente, except that 1) you can
capture "triplets" (three-in-a-row) as well as pairs, and 2) to win, you
need to capture 15 stones rather than 10 as in Pente.  It is quite unique,
and results in long, interesting games!  It was invented by Rollie Tesh,
the 1982-4 Champion of Pente.  :-)
