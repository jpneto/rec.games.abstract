Need to play it a bit to know, but no matter how good the game is, as
a commercial project it is doomed. OK, maybe a little strong, we could
say you have an immense uphill path ahead of you. Have you ever heard
of Plateau?

Its history is something every would-be abstract self-publisher should
read. The Plateau designer had everything going for him, including
very good exposure of the game and a recommendation from Sid Sackson,
and expended a lot of money, and still it is only an obscure curiosity
today. So don't bet your life savings on it...

Yes, I am aware of the challenges ahead, although I believe that you
may be a little too pessimistic...

I don't expect to make a living off of this, breaking even will
satisfy me fine.

Also, I would say that my game is rather unique. I have never seen any
board with looks quite like it.
