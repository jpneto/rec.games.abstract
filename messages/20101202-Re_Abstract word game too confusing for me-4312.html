Hi Mike!   Bad luck that you turned up at this moment of history!

I thought I would lurk here for a few days and gain a little insight on
the theory and practice of abstract games. But all I find appears to be
insults and flames.

Correct.  It is almost all that.

This has come about due to years of insults and venom from
Mark Steere to almost everyone else.   He is a hater.

"Surely", I think "there must be some underlying structure, message,

No.  It is all Mark S.    If he left, all the venom would stop.

But try as I do, I cannot fathom the objective, play, or scoring

It is beyond fathoming.  Best thing is to join r.g.c. where
there is no venom, and games themselves are actually discussed.

Recre.Games.Combinatorial.        r.g.c.

Best, is just to write directly to Jack Spritz whose address
you will see on various posts here.  Actually, he has probably
sent you an invite by now, I'd guess.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It's a closed group with the ambition to "to discuss abstract games
in a productive and encouraging environment".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As it is.  There is an invent-a-new-game competition going on there
at the moment, and several fascinating threads to read back on.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
it can't be the insults, because Bill Taylor <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> allowed in there
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is very disingenuous of Freeling.  I made a criticism of one
of his games, (which, incidentally, I didn't even know was one
of his at the time I made it), and he took considerable offense,
in spite of saying he didn't.  It is clear that he did, because
his followup post was full of snide comments and not-so-subtle
put-downs, and peremptory demands to "explain myself".

When I failed to respond sufficiently quickly, he threw his toys out
of the cot, and stormed over to here, where he continued insulting me
in a most vituperative manner.  After having olive branches turned
down, I started to respond in kind. Mark, of course, has had people
responding in kind to him, for some time.

The upshot is, the group is dead, as a discussion medium.
Actually, it has been for some time, and you can read back over
the last year of posts, picking Steere's at random,
and see the cause.      The hater.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Bill Taylor doesn't like Mark.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nobody does, except maybe two other people.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Bill Taylor doesn't like me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Not after his unjustified outburst showing extreme touchiness.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Bill Taylor likes profanity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't; it's just fighting fire with fire.
It seems to be all that Steere understands.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 I wouldn't express my opinions quite the way Mark does,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nobody could!    But Freeling certainly tries his best.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Mark has an undeniable talent
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nonsense.  He discovered one great game, (and failed to see or
learn the obvious connection to an infinite sequence of games),
and everything else he has done has been either boring, or in one
case virtually incomprehensible.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
not a moderated forum.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Worse luck.  Otherwise it would not be dead.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
On the same note: I wish Bill would keep to
"discussing abstract games in a productive and encouraging
environment" - but he keeps showing up here.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I never left here.  Mark Steere said he was going to leave
for good, once.  But as usual, it was all lies.

So do what you think best, Mike, but it will be useless
to stay here hoping for sensible game discussion.

Incidentally, this post will almost certainly draw more
vituperative and venomous fire from Freeling or Steere,
but I will not reply sensibly to it.  In the unlikely case that
there are valid points to answer, my answers will be in r.g.c.
where you can consider them and ask further at your leisure.

Good luck to you, Mike!

Bill
