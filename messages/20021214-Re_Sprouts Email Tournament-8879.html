On the other hand, I also know from my own experience that there are
strategical ideas that can give us guidance and orientation in the
absence of a total calculation. The survivor concept is the best
example of such a strategical idea. A given position might have just
enough liberties to make 3 or 4 survivors the likely outcome. One
player will need 3, the other 4. The first player will try to "dry up"
the position while the second player will play for fecundity. The
players can meaningfully make these attempts even if they cannot do
the complete calculation. For instance, enclosing moves tend to be
more fecund.

Isn't it more tricky than this? It seems to me that it's not enough to
be able to say "looking at this position, it's likely to make either 3
or 4 survivors" -- you also need to estimate the parity of the number of
moves it will take before this happens.

Matthew,

The parity of the survivors would control the parity of the moves. 
Let's use "liberty" (L) such that we can say that every move uses up
two liberties but puts one back.  The total number of moves in a
position will be L - S, where "S" is the number of survivors.

The 5 spot game is a good example.  The player moving first can win by
forcing the production of 4 survivors.  Since every original spot has
3 liberties, the total number of moves will be 3*5 - 4.

Misere sprouts is sprouts in which the player moving last loses.  The
player moving first can also win the 5 spot misere game, this time by
forcing the production of 3 spots.

If you experiment a bit with both types of the 5 spot game, I think
you will see how powerful the survivor concept actually is.  You will
be able to beat all of your friends, almost without thinking, and
certainly without exhaustive tree analysis or any Sprague-Grundy
analysis.  And your friends will keep playing long after you know they
should resign.

(I don't know, you might want to review the UT simplification
maneuver, discussed in a previous post, to really keep it simple.  Let
me know if you have problems.)
