Uses of The 4th Dimension (The HUMAN RACE has a new Discovery!)


--


Note Before: Everything you read on this page is The Truth.
What does this mean?
It means, if you try to do what is written here:
EXAMPLE: "If you just make a wish",
it will be granted in The 4th Dimension
for you to enjoy there.
You have nothing to lose.
- The Author of "Ueber Alles"

Since I discovered The 4th Dimension, one of the conclusions
I have reached is, The 4th Dimension is an infinite access to The
Truth.
Throughout this website, I use the term "I wish" - it is really a way
to voice a person's desire - and from the work I have done - it really
works.

From the saying: "Ask and you shall receive", I have understood that
any
human being can make an infinity of "wishes" and receive The Truth
(the correct answer) to every question they may have, in the form of a
dream
- that same night.

A person is not limited to the proverbial "3 wishes".



--

From my research, I have also seen that other people have also known
about this dimension and have "kept silent" about it.

They have been conducting activities that I will term "criminal", this
is why I have included a tract for Law Enforcement, so that they
can become aware that this dimension exists and they can use it as a
tool
to acquire The Truth to solve any and all crimes.



--

Use The 4th Dimension to verify all data on this website: Ueber Alles

I have put some notes down for Mathematicians,
Physicists, Computer Scientists, and Engineers
- all data they see, they can verify in thiis way:

To do this, just say this out loud before going to sleep
(this is called by MetaPhysicists - programming your sleep)

"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH:
IS THE SCIENTIFIC DATA ON "UEBER ALLES" ACCURATE?"

Go to sleep and you will receive The Truth - that night.



--

Take a sneak peek at "Ueber Alles - The Movie"

The many uses of the 4th Dimension is still to be researched
by humanity, but one use that may interest anyone is to get a
sneak peek at the movie "Ueber Alles".

To do this, just say this out loud before going to sleep:


"I WISH TO SEE A PREVIEW OF "UEBER ALLES - THE MOVIE"


Go to sleep and you will get a sneak preview.



--

Further.....

Using The 4th Dimension, not only can you get a sneak preview
of "Ueber Alles", you can also EXPERIENCE The Movie
"Ueber Alles", by becoming any of the characters in it.

Just program your sleep and you can experience,
"Ueber Alles" rather than "just watch it."



--

To be any character of "Ueber Alles", "Plan Odelia",
"The Constance Factor", or "American Street Fighters"

Just do the following:
Say this out loud, before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO BE: [ INSERT NAME OF CHARACTER HERE ]"

Go to sleep and you will play the role of that character that night!



--

Example:

If you want to experience the character:
"Kurt Schwierige", just do the following:

Say this out loud, before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO BE: "KURT SCHWIERIGE OF UEBER ALLES - THE MOVIE".

Go to sleep and you will play the character, "Kurt Schwierige", that
night!



--

If you want to experience the character:
"Sarafina Penelope Attar", just do the following:

Say this out loud, before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO BE: "SARAFINA PENELOPE ATTAR OF UEBER ALLES - THE MOVIE".
Go to sleep and you will play the character, "Sarafina Penelope Attar",
that night!



--

If you choose to look for The Prophetess (subplot of Ueber Alles - The
Movie)
and want to experience the character: "You", just do the following:


Say this out loud, before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO BE: "MYSELF OF UEBER ALLES - THE MOVIE".
Go to sleep and you will play the character, "You"
(that searches for The Prophetess), that night!



--

It is recommended that men, play male character roles and women,
play female character roles while in The 4th Dimension (4D Space),
this avoids confusion of thought and in The 4th Dimension
[ because it is all mind (thought) ] a person needs to avoid confusion!

Use The 4th Dimension to find your soulmate

This is very easy to do - all you need to know is
The Truth of WHO your soulmate is.

To find your soulmate, do the following:



--

Say this out loud before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH:
WHO IS MY SOULMATE?"



--

Go to sleep and you will get The Truth
in the form of a dream that night.

Once you find out The Truth, why waste anymore time?
When you wake up, go find "him" or "her" and be happy.



--

What if your soulmate is in another country or far away?

No Problem....Use The 4th Dimension to make contact..
that is, use it "like a telephone" or "a chat room".

Here's how...

Once you find out WHO your soulmate is, contact
his/her mind via The 4th Dimension in this way:



--

Say this out loud before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO MEET MY SOULMATE."



--

Go to sleep and you will meet THE MIND of your
soulmate THAT NIGHT in the form of a dream.

What does this mean?

It means you are ACTUALLY SPEAKING MIND - TO - MIND
with your soulmate, so when you wake up in the morning
(that is, your minds re-enter your physical bodies)
you remember your meeting - it really took place!

Keep meeting in this way until you can meet in the physical world.



--

Use The 4th Dimension to NEVER BE LIED TO AGAIN

This is one of the best benefits of using The 4th Dimension.

You can use it to stop a lie, before it takes root in your mind.

If a lie takes root in a person's mind,
that person is manipulated by that lie and the liar.

Lies also wastes a person's time and energy.

To stop ALL LIES before they take root, do the following:

Say this out loud before you go to sleep:

"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH:
IS [ INSERT NAME OF PERSON HERE ] LYING TO ME?"

Go to sleep and you will receive The Truth about your question that
night.

This tool is invaluable, because it helps you understand the motive
of anything presented to you in the physical world (3rd Dimension).



--

Use The 4th Dimension as a "University" [ get an education ]

You can know and learn anything and everything (no matter how old
you are ), your heart desires - FREE - the important thing is
- is that you are learning The Truth about  any matter
or subject.

You can learn and understand: Physics,
Mathematics, Science, Engineering,
Botany, Medicine, etc

All you have to do is "request The Truth" about a subject -
that is, "make a wish" and you will receive an education on
that subject matter - that night.

To learn any subject matter, you desire to know, say this
out loud before you go to sleep: to sleep:



--

"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH:
about [ INSERT SUBJECT HERE ]"



--

Go to sleep and you will get a lesson, on that subject, that night.



--

EXAMPLE:

Use this tool to study History.

What better way to study History, than to experience History.

Pick any piece of History and make a wish:

Like so:

"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION."

Go to sleep and you will get a lesson on that point in time.

NOTE: When you study History, you are more like a "witness" of History.

You do not (CANNOT) change the past to affect the present.



--

Use The 4th Dimension to try ( new types of ) food

One of the miracles of The 4th Dimension when it comes to food is:
The food actually tastes better than in the physical world (3rd
Dimension)
and you do not gain any (physical) weight.

Use this dimension to eat your favorite foods ("FAT FREE")
or try new and exotic dishes.

To have a "fancy meal" in the 4th Dimension,
say this out loud before you go to sleep:

"I WISH TO EAT:
[ INSERT FOOD YOU WOULD LIKE TO EAT HERE ]"

Go to sleep and your meal will be served up
in a dream sequence.

Use The 4th Dimension to visit places thought of as "Fiction"

With The 4th Dimension as a tool, places you read in books, actually
have
"a mental state of existence" - that is, they exist and the environment

can be experienced.

Visit the school of "Hogwarts" or the wonderful land of
"Narnia" or even "Middle-Earth".

To visit places you thought "only existed in books or movies"
say this out loud before you go to sleep:

"I WISH TO GO TO [ ENTER 'FANTASY LOCATION' YOU WANT TO VISIT ]"

Go to sleep and you will be "whisked" to that land to experience (just
respect the locals).

EXAMPLE:

To go to the school of "Hogwarts" do the following:

Say this out loud before you go to sleep:

"I WISH TO GO TO HOGWARTS"

Go to sleep and you will visit that school of magic and fantasy.

Use The 4th Dimension to travel the world

Have you ever wanted to go to London, Rome,
Amsterdam, Prague, or any city in the world - but never been?
Why wait? You can go there TONIGHT - FREE - via The 4th Dimension.

Just program your sleep and you will experience these
fantastic cities (or any place on earth you desire to visit),
just like a real vacation in the physical world.

To visit any city in the world,
Say this out loud, before you go to sleep:
"I WISH TO GO TO [ INSERT NAME OF CITY HERE ]"

Go to sleep and you will experience (visit) that city.

As you can understand, the most precious time of the
day is really whenever you fall asleep.

That is, you have the opportunity to access The Truth
to know or do anything your heart desires. You just have to
program your sleep and pay attention to your dream time.

Your mind then retains the memory of your research of
The Truth or your adventures in The 4th Dimension.




--

Try to make at least 1 wish per night.

(<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>wink<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>)



--

If you make a wish and change your mind, just make another one.

It is the last wish you make, before you sleep,
that you pay attention to.

- Sweet Dreams

The question of "nightmares"

When you start to get the "hang of it" of making wishes
and actually enjoying the wish made, you may run into
a nightmare or two.

Start to understand a nightmare as "psychic garbage", but
understand that it is consciously done by someone.

To find out who is giving you nightmares,
just ask for The Truth, like this:

Say this out loud before you go to sleep:

"I WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH:
WHO IS GIVING ME NIGHTMARES?"

Go to sleep and you will receive The Truth in a dream.

Once the person giving you nightmares understands
that you are actually AWARE of him/her,
it should stop!
