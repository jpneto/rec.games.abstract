I soon found a couple of deadlock patterns:

x x o
x . .
o . x

    o x  
x . . .  
o . x . o
  . . . x
  x o    

I could have simply banned them, but that would have been awkward, not to mention that there might be an unlimited number of them, each one more convoluted than the others.

Over the past few days, I've been trying to find more such deadlock patterns by trial and error and have found none yet. This is getting intriguing.

I still think there must be more of them, but if I managed to prove the opposite I might be tempted to ban those two and make Orcoon a pure connection game.

Could anyone help me with this issue? I know I should use some kind of logical procedure, but I have no idea where to start. All I know is every new pattern must consist of a partial combination of the previous ones, and so bigger than them, but that doesn't seem to be helping much.

I'd appreciate any methodological advice - or conclusive proof, for that matter :)
