Nomad examines Geoff.
Blob says: It should be very easy to change to allow mailing to committees,
Nomad looks you over.
Blob says: so long as I can get at the appropriate scoreboard object
Blob says: Hi there, nomad.
Blob examines Nomad.
Geoff nods with a floppy head.
Geoff bows to Nomad.
Blob shakes Nomad's hand.
Geoff says: I'll see what I can do about that.
Nomad grins evilly.

Geoff examines Nomad.
Blob says: Danke
Nomad greets you cordially
Nomad says: where should a newbie begin here?
Geoff says: did you type "info" at the login location?
Nomad rewires the neurons in your brain - now you are a television set
Geoff duhs.
Nomad says: yeh - but I was interested in HOW things happen
Geoff says: ok - well ftping the rules is good too.
Geoff says: so you can read them.
Geoff says: they define most stuff.
Geoff says: to actually make proposals you post them on this board
Geoff says: then type "propose"
Geoff says: they go into the voting chamber (to the east)
Geoff says: where you can vote for/against proposals.
Nomad says: ahh, that is what I wanted to know - how big are they?
Geoff says: the rules?
Geoff says: reasonably large.
Nomad says: a couple of Megs?
Geoff says: there are committees which can get you into the hang of things.
Geoff says: not the large!
Geoff says: gawd - no one could know the rules then.
-- More ? (60%) (Enter h for help : q to quit) --
Nomad says "phew!'
Geoff says: 50K of text.
Nomad says: how many pages then
Geoff says: reasonably well organised.
Nomad hates locking his disks
Geoff thinks carefully.
Geoff says: 900 lines
Geoff says: depends on your page size :)
Nomad hears cogs whiring...
Geoff says: you can see individual rules and proposals by using "rule &lt;num&gt;"
or "prop &lt;num&gt;"
Geoff says: here.
Nomad says: no problem - I'll get round to that then ;)
Geoff says: they should be all available here.
Nomad says: hmm, there is no rule or prop 1 available here...
Geoff says: start with 101...
Geoff says: numbers 101-115, 201-22?, 1000-1250
Geoff says: use "prop" for the time being.
Geoff says: rule only will return active rules..
Nomad says: what is the difference between a rule and a prop
Geoff says: proposal is the number it receives when it is placed up to vote.
Geoff says: a rule is an "number".
-- More ? (90%) (Enter h for help : q to quit) --
Geoff says: there is a high correspondence between them
Geoff says: due to unclarity in the initial rules set..
Geoff says: but it's beginning to change.
Geoff says: for example "rule 203"
Geoff says: is prop "1218B"
Nomad says: BTW what time does this place get active - this is the 1st time I
have seen people here?
Geoff says: usually 8 hours ago..
