"In your game, you have to choose the longest path between a male and a female, but I wonder if that's a good idea. If you have only one huge group, you can just connect your first pair by going through all your stones."

Mister Luis, you always have the same problem when it comes to commenting any game : you do not put yourself in the mind of the designer who creates the game. You are always trying to link any game to your games to your interests.
So you will never progress like Christian Freeling. Erase what you know. Read carefully the rules. Try to understand the core of the game. Forget about the details. Then comment! 
Sometimes you need to play test the game to understand if an idea is good or no.
First you are assuming that you could have a huge group. That means that your opponent is either dumb or making suicide.
Second : assume that you succeed to have one huge and compact group. You will then connect all your off-springs by using only one pair. Then you are genius you won! 
Third : your main problem at designing is that you are flooded by details and forgetting the core of the game. So you will never innovate! Never! You are just wasting your by adding to the same game some details. All your games are just "amendments" nothing more.
Get of your little mind and be more imaginative more free. You are enslaved by some mechanics.
