Ok, i just played a game against the AI, and I don't know if you're
the developer, or connected to the developer, but if so, there are
extremely serious problems with the interface.

1.  The constant enforced perspectival changes are dizzying, time
consuming, and extremely annoying.
2.  The fact that the perspective zooms in on one part of the board
when you select the type of move you make makes it very hard to think
about the board as a whole after that point.  Also extremely annoying.
3.  Perhaps worst of all, the AI broke the core rule of the game -
namely that you can't place a wall so that your opponent has no open
path to his goal.  Nonetheless, that's exactly what the AI did to me.
This game has only like 3 rules.  How in the world could the developer
possibly miss this one, the most important one of the 3?

Sigh. My long wait continues...
