In that respect, and now I'm back to Cameron: in Stax the first
hexagram is present, unmovable and unchanging, how fitting :) , but
there are two asymmetrical threes missing - that's twelve hexagrams.
Those would have to be included in a new game - and we're talking
about a new game here, right :)

Yes the two missing tiles would have to be restored, but that's not a
problem as they were initially removed for aesthetic and not gameplay
reasons.

And it may turn out that Stax provides all the operations that are
required to manipulate hexagrams: movement, rotation, hiding,
revealing.

Ah, mindful of Fizzy's comment in the Stacking thread ("The other
thing I don't like is the memory factor.  In fact, it takes it out of
my definiton of perfect information game if you must rely on memory to
know the properties of the covered pieces.") I see you present an
"it's not a bug it's afeature" way around this ;-)

And yes, this would be quite in the spirit of such a game, but it
wouldn't be Stax anymore, of course.
