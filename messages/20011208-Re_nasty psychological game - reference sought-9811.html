I'm not sure, but I notice you do not mention the case x=1.
At first, I thought this would be a sure win for B, until I
saw bids must be &lt; 1.

I don't see where he said bids were &lt; 1.  He said "between 0 and
one's score".  And if you allow bids of exactly 0 or one's score,
then you eliminate all those nasty questions of "who can name the
smaller epsilon".

Given this, you can generalise the position by observing that
multiplying both player's scores by the same amount (other than
zero) has no effect on the probability.  So then, given a pair of
scores, you can represent each player's strategy as a probability
distribution P(s) where P(s) is the probability that the player
bids s.  (Or perhaps the probability he bids less than or equal
to s; I'm not sure which works better.)  The function P(s) will,
of course, be a function of the two scores.  Then B's chance of
winning is the double-integral across all possible bids by both
players, of the chance of those particular bids, times the
probability of B winning given the resulting scores.

I don't have time to do the math beyond that, but that's what
you're trying to solve for.
