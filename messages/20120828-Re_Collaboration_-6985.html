Also the game itself is an intriguing idea, though there might be a lot of (too much?) positive feedback in it. Between skilled players, first capturer may always go on to win. Need to test.

Yeah this is my initial impression as well. Maybe if the newly added stones had to be placed somewhere relative to the positions of other enemy stones it would create a disincentive to capture. Also you said you didn't want the game to be derivative of Oust Mark but it already is since it involves the dots and boxes protocol applied to capturing.
