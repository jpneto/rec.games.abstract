The issues faced by this is that people can't buy 10x10 boards

I've come across this issue in another connection.

I saw a board game in a thrift shop that I think I've seen in thrift
shops before. I ignored it, although it was a bit similar, as an
enlarged and improved version of checkers, to Camelot, which I've been
digging up information about.

After finding information on the game on the Internet, I went back out
to pick it up, because the game has a devoted following, and is rare,
having been available only for one year.

But it had a serious flaw - not in the gameplay as such, but in another
area.

Like regular checkers, it was played on squares of only one color. But
it was played on an enlarged board.

As it happens, the enlarged board was a diamond-shaped board of 64 + 49
squares... so the squares of one color that the game used formed an 8 x
8 square array!

Which meant the game could be played equally well on an ordinary
checkerboard (with two normal sets of checkers) if the pieces were to
move and jump orthogonally instead of diagonally - although the special
game board did have the advantage of clearly indicating the central 4 by
4 square, which plays an important role in the game.

Even though the feeling might be irrational, the irrational and the
superficial play a role in human psychology. People paying from $15 to
$40 for a game in a box expect fancy (if still from cheap plastic and
cardboard) equipment for the game on which the game is dependent. I
figure that when people notice that the squares on which the game is
played form an 8 by 8 board, they will feel cheated, however unjustified
that attitude might be.

The creator of the game was, some years back, considering
self-publishing the game, and had made attempts to contact suppliers of
Backgammon discs. AFAIK, nothing had come of it.

Would adding rules for a Camelot-like game that used all the squares of
the board solve the problem? There are particular problems with that
approach, even if there were no legal issues, given the history of the
game (its publisher was also bought by Hasbro, and imitating one of the
games they own because of Parker Brothers, even if the letter of the law
were followed, would be unfriendly since they were nice enough to let
the creator of a game made by one of the other companies they bought
regain his rights).

Including chess pieces and the rules for my Spectral Realm Chess, which
is freely available to all, wouldn't help as much; that might be
likelier to exacerbate the problem than alleviate it. And English Gothic
Double Checkers would also make things worse, not better.
