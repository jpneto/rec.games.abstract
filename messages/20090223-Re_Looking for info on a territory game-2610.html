Palisade, among others.

Such games are highly susceptible to draws, normally, since players
easily thwart each other's attempts at circles with straight lines.
Palisade addresses this issue with board parity, but in so doing
creates unequal goals.  Not my favorite design.

A mate was trying to describe to me a game he used to play. I was
wondering what it was called, and after more info about it.

It's played on a square grid. You take turns selecting a vertex.
If your vertex completes a connected loop of vertices of your colour,
where connections can be diagonal or along the edges of the square
grid, then every vertex inside that loop becomes yours too. (Including
previously captured loops that your opponent has made.) The winner
is the player with the largest total territory at the end of the game.

amazed, it was awesome, recognised every word I said. Then I said the
wrong word ... and it typed the right one. It was actually just
detecting a sound and printing the expected word! -- pbhj on /.
