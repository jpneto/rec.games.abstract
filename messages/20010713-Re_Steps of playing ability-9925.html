Right. Here i try a "bugfix":

You can change the definition in the way, that every single person-person
realtion is counted only as one item. Than you are one level higher, if you
win &gt;50% against 75% of Opponents one level below.

This doesn't solve the problem. You aren't going to be able to measure
just complexity by grouping players based on skill (using win - loss data)
and counting the number of groups. The win - loss records will be effected
by effected by short term variances in player skill and in game luck. Games
can be easily modified to change these items without changing what most
people would regard as the complexity of a game.

This method is also based on the population playing the game. Depending
on the game, the kinds of populations playing them can be quite different
and comparing the number of levels may not mean a whole lot.
