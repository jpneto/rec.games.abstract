I got to play 1 game today with a stranger.  We played on a 7x7 because he didn't have very much time.  It took a little time for the nearest unit movement rule to sink in, but was worth the minimal effort.  I look forward to playing it again on a larger board!  

I'll wait to lose taste for the game when I get into a draw situation.  I'll be sure to post if I do and I hope others do as well.  As for now it's a simple game to teach, I have the equipment, and some friends who like to play scalable abstracts so it's sure to get some play in my neighborhood.

Akron is also not rock solid drawless, but I've never been in nor heard of anyone ever getting a draw and I'm sure I've played over 100 games.  Maybe it's more of a personal design expectation failure than a detriment to the game.  I guess time (or some badass computing skillz) will tell.  I guess worst case would be if it shows up once opposing players have reached a peak in their skill level and thus feel like they've wasted their time studying the subtleties of the game etc...
