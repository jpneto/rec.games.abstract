  Does anyone know if {\it en passant} capture is permitted
in Alice Chess?  The situation isn't  mentioned in the description 
of Alice Chess in David Pritchard's Encyclopaedia (recently mentioned 
in this group), which suggests that the rule is meant to be inherited 
unchanged from orthodox chess.  Logically, I should have thought that 
a pawn that moves two squares forward would have to be captured on
the third rank of the board from which it started, rather
than the board on which it ends up.  Is this correct?

	Since the pawn to be captured has made exactly one move, it would
have to be captured on the second board if it is to be captured e.p. Af-
ter the capture, the capturing pawn winds up on the home board.
	For postal play in the NOST (in which many Chess Variants are
played), en passant is often forbidden for variants, because keeping it
is often more trouble than it's worth.
