Peter Stein is annoyed at checker items in the chess group.
I was for many years both a tournament chess player (am
past president of the Virginia Chess Federation) and a
tournament checker player and have a strong interest in
both games, though I no longer play either other than with
my computer (raising four kids leave time for little else).
 
Certainly there are points in common.  A message remembering 
Newell Banks, for example, would fit in both the chess and
the abstract games groups (it may not interest Mr. Stein,
but interesting Mr. Stein is not in the charter of group).
A good friend of mine has been a state chess champion and a
top postal chess player, as well as a state checkers
champion and one of the top players in the South.  Were he
to discuss how chess skill helped his checkers skill that
should fit in both. 
 
Finally, when I was in Chicago one of my favorite chess
opponents at the No Exit Cafe rapid tournaments was David
Slate, who was one of the programmers of the then world
chess champion computer program.  David was working then on
a checkers program as well.  I would love to hear his
perspective today on both games (by the way, anybody know
David's whereabouts? -- I left Chicago in 1980, and
organized chess in 1982).
 
I learned about the Tinsley match by reading the chess
group.  I had not realized the abstract games group covered
checkers.  And I think that on topics which overlap both
games (and the ability of computers to play does) or which
refer to chess players doing other things (e.g. if Kasparov
were to publish a book of poems) should all be within the
scope of a chess group.  Those of us who primarily lurk to
keep up with a world we were once a part of would
appreciate it.
