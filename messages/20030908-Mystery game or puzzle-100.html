Hi all,

I recently purchased for a very small sum an object which looks like it
might be a game or puzzle. It consists of 37 small black cylindrical objects
with white arrows on one end, bound together by a tight black rubber band.
It is possible to get the drums into a hexagonal pattern with 7 rows
(4-5-6-7-6-5-4). Various drums are also connected to each other by solid
links - it is possible that all 37 are so connected, but I can't be sure.
The configuration of drums can be changed, although this requires stretching
the band.

I am guessing that the aim of the game is to get all 37 arrows lined up in
the same direction, but I can't tell if I am supposed to do it with the
rubber band on or off. I suspect that if I take it off, I won't be able to
get it back on again. Thanks.
