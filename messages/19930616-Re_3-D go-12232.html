Very interesting topic, really.

Here's the first big problem: a single stone can have up to six
liberties, compared with four. Two connected stones have ten liberties,
instead of six. So every time you add a stone to a line and your
opponent forms his own wall alongside, you get three extra liberties,
instead of the one you get in two-dimensional go. Imagine how easy it
would be to dodge in go if you could run away straight up or straight
down. This makes encircling groups, and hence territory, very much
harder. Hard enough it probably isn't interesting. In a way it's a

Sorry, but this is not a logical reasoning.
If you can easily run away with a group because getting easier liberties in 3d
than in 2d it doesn't mean this group can easier survive !  
So the live&amp;death problem could be as hard as in 2d (maybe even harder?)

visualise to be playable. Maybe with some very good graphics software it
would be a different story.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think this is the true reason: The much harder visualisation of a 3d
lattice placed with stones make it not so playable.

We also speculated chinese rather than japanese rules, since territory

If you can't decide what's territory and what isn't you aren't going to
be able to get far regardless of what rule set you choose, but I think
the usual definition of territory, complete enclosure by living groups,
should work.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think chinese rules ever works regardless of the underlaying lattices. Place
your stones were you can and like; if you place it into "own" territory you
loose no points! And the opponents territory is there were your stones can't
be placed or will be removed by him :)

Yes, I agree (but you need not to know what is an eye in chinese rules)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You need to be able to connect up all the groups enclosing the eye. In
go that means controlling four out of four sides and three out of four
corners. In 3D go I doubt the rules are so simple. There are six faces,
twelve edges and eight corners to every eye. I think you just have to
trace the connections.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Yes but you need these regardations only for small groups, which just manage
to live. And I risk a conjecture: The average size of a typical group in
a n-dimensional hyper-cubic lattices will be great. It is not a precious
statement but my feeling is as higher the dimension of the lattice will be
as less groups groups will be survive on the board compared with a board of
the same point number in lower dimensions.
So replace "of 6 groups on the board 1 will be death" by "of 4 groups on a 3-d
board 1 will be death" or ?
