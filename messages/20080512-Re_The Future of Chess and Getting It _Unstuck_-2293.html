That is largely because the only thing Feynman knew about computers

his observation mostly concern 1950s Burroughs history, not
computers.

No.  Combining two classical computers together makes a computer twice
as big that can do (roughly) twice as much work in a given time.
Connecting two quantum computers would make a computer twice as big

time.

You guys are speaking rather orthogonally.  In theory (his topic),
quantum computers could do all this and more.  In practice (yours),
adding more qubits is (so far) Really Difficult; it will take a
major technological breakthrough to build a quantum computer with
enough qubits that a network of classical computers can't simulate
it at full speed.

The original topic had to do with the future of chess, and where it
might head.  This then spawned "Hereclitian-Calvinball" as a question
of whether or not there is a finite or infinite number of potential
chess variants.  Maybe Quantum Computing can answer this question.

But isn't the [gigantic]  fly in the ointment the fact that parrallelism to 
increase brute-force solutions is still a very questionable paradigm?

After all, the comprehension of two 1600 players does not equal that of a 
2200 player.

While there may be an increase in event horizon by quantitative analysis 
which may achieve some result, the 'fly' is that these are typically 
quantitative assessments based on materials won/lost, aso where is the 
qualitative one?

    [[ IE: unless a conclusive result is achieved by brute-forcing, 
[example; mate] then what does any program do when at ply 12 it sees the win 
of a pawn, but costing two tempii? Perhaps it will continue for another 12 
plies and discover it recovers one tempo, keeps the pawn, but loses the 
initiative... ]]

Therefore what is lacking in brute-force approaches is qualitative 
evaluation of <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>specific<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> positions.

The 'fly' turns out to be a man-made one - since evaluating a tempo or other 
positional factors such as initiative, are factors that the programmer 
assesses, not the chess-engine. Furthermore, these assessments must 
necessarily be abstracted ones, sui generis, since they are <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>initial<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> data 
programmed in the chess engine, created from mean data, as averaged 
ennumerated evaluations.

As we know, many 'averages' never occur, since data sets can be heavily 
polarised away from any instance of mean value - the averaged condition that 
is pre-programmed may in fact, <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> occur].

Attempts to correct qualitative analysis lie in provision of yet more data 
evaluation sets, such as for middle-games, or sub-sets where 2 bishops have 
an open/closed position, etc. But the program itself does not generate the 
data set!

Thereby, no contextual evaluation of the worth of material/positional 
factors takes place by the act of the chess engine's own calculus - and this 
is the stalled point in chess computing emulations, [emulation* since the 
program is merely acting on received data and not conducting its own 
evaluation] and has been so for 10 years. It is so stalled, that AI 
researchers gave it up as anything much useful to them.

To remove chess computing from emulation, the program needs to not only play 
its own moves, but successively generate its own evaluation criteria.
