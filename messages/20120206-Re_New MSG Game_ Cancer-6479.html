So what??  In Oust, also a game of annihilation, I've seen one player
get down to one stone against a hundred enemy stones, an
"overwhelming" material disadvantage, and then turn the game around
and win.  The effect is even more extreme in Rive, a territory game
like Go.  You can be completely wiped out to zero stones more than
once and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>still<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> come back and win.

Yep.  If it's down to two groups, one of each player's color, with a
few unoccupied points to fill in, then yes, it's boiled down to a game
of Nim at that point.

I don't like that aspect of Cancer, but by the same token, parity is
only a "curse" if you can't handle parity.  What do you think Dots and
Boxes is?   A big game of parity.

I'd be glad to be proved wrong, but if these endgame

I suspect capricious Cancer outcomes are more likely on a toy, 5x5x5
board.  How much serious strategery were you hoping to derive from toy
Cancer?  How strategic would toy Go be?

If the Nimliness of Cancer is really a problem, maybe we <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>should<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
consider non-cancerous eyes.  Completely different game though.  Now
both players will not always have a move available.
