Hi,

I've heard that fruit machine programs are based on "Game Theory" and
was wondering if there are any online examples or descriptions of them
(sorta "Know Thy Enemy" impulse prompted me to ask).

I can't say how modern digital slot machine programs are written, as
I'm sure it is a closely guarded secret.  But I can tell you how the
old-fashioned machines worked and how you figure out the average
payback of those.  Early digital slot machines probably micmicked
their mechanical counterparts, and in some sense the digital ones
should do so in order to avoid being accused of cheating.

Anyway, the traditional slot machine has three wheels with symbols.
The symbols occur in different numbers on the different wheels, and
are usually arranged to give an impression that winning combinations
are easier to get than they actually are.  For example, there might be
more lemons on the first and third wheel than on the second wheel, so
you fairly often get two lemons (first and third) but rarely three, as
the lemon would be rare on the middle wheel.

The figure out the probability of a winning combinations, you must
know th enumbers of each symbol on each wheel (and, consequently, how
many symbols total thare aer on a wheel).  In the old mechanical
machines, you can in most cases assume that all symbols are equally
likely, so the change of three lemons would be

 (lemons on wheel 1)*(lemons on wheel 2)*(lemons on wheel 3)/N^3

where N is the number of symbols on a wheel.  This gives a probability
between 0 and 1, to get a percentage multiply this by 100.

If you multiply with the payback for the combination and add up this
for all paying combinations, you get the total payback.  This will be
less than 1 (or less than 100%, if you converted the probabilities to
percentages), so the owner will earn on the machine.  Some countries
and states have laws on minimal payback percentages.

Anyway, due to human nature, it is not the payback percentage that
makes players choose machines, it is the top payout (jackpot) -- no
matter how unlikely this is.  This prompted the addition of a fourth
and fifth wheel on slot machines, so you can make the jackpot
combination extremely unlikely, so you fairly safely can put a huge
prize on it.  To spread out the risk for the owner, the high-jackpot
machines are usually found in places with a large number of machines
(or in chains of gaming dens).

Now, it gets a bit more complicated if the slot machine allows a
player to hold some of the wheels on non-payout combinations.  Here,
you must for each combination of held wheels recalculate the average
payout under the condition that one or two wheels are fixed.  If this
is higher than the payout on non-held wheels, you must add the
probability of the held combination times half of the conditional
payout to the total payout calculated above (half because you need an
extra coin to exploit the held combination).  You normally can't hold
twice in a row, so you don't have to iterate this for the conditional
payout calculation.

Again, you can add in psychology.  Even if the ability to hold wheels
increases average payout (and it doesn't have to, as you can adjust
the mis of symbols to decrease the payout equivalently), it may prompt
players to play more.  And you can also add combinations that might
seem to be worth holding, but which actually reduce the payout.  For
example, if three (or four or five) bars give the maximum payout,
people may tend to hold even a single bar.  Though this increases the
chance of jackpot, it might well decrease the average payout (which is
what the owners mainly care about).

I don't know if you call this game theory, but I'm sure a lot of this
type of thought is put into the distribution of symbols on slot
machines.

Thankyou Torben, you've ceratinly given me an insight though I admit
the maths is largely beyond my comprehension!
