<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear sir,
<br>
<br>Thanks you very much for your answer, you gave me very interesting tricks.
<br>
<br>I have just a question about this part :
<br>
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. For positions with N empty spaces (starting with N=1 and
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving up), let value be determined by the values of positions
<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reachable in one move (by placing a piece in one empty space).
<br>
<br>When you say to place a piece in one empty space, you mean to try all 
the possibilities with the current color and do an average of them ?
<br>
<br>
<br>Best regards,
<br>
<br>JM
<br>

<br>Here are the vectors of my regression :

<br>where

<br>
<br>class = 1 if this position has a majority of victories, 0 otherwise
<br>
<br>I use 13 differents pattern, and with 4 symmetries, I have a 52 vector

<br>Is it the good way to proceed, or I made something wrong ?

<br>Othello is best played by a computer using brute force.&nbsp; This implies:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- Make a fast move generator.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- Use tables for position evaluation.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- Do complete end-game search using only win/no-win as alpha/beta.
<br>
<br>The tables you can use are:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- A table assigning values to edge positions.&nbsp; There are 3^8 = 6561
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; possible edge positions in one row, so this table is not very
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; large.&nbsp; You can let a table assign values to two-deep edge
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; positions (edge row + next row in), which has 3^16 = 43 million
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; positions.&nbsp; This easily fits in RAM on a modern computer.&nbsp; Let a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; program analyse all possible positions offline to build the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; table. Use the following strategy to build the table:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Assign value to positions with no empty spaces as just the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; difference between white and black pieces.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. For positions with N empty spaces (starting with N=1 and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moving up), let value be determined by the values of positions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reachable in one move (by placing a piece in one empty space).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- Use a table of exceptions.&nbsp; Let the computer play a large number of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; games (against itself or other programs) using, say, four-deep
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; search.&nbsp; If the evaluation of a position using four-deep search is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; markedly different from the evaluation using no search (leaf-node
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; evaluation), store the four-deep value in a table using a hash of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the board position as index.&nbsp; An exception table can make an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; opening library superfluous.
<br>
<br>So, in the end-game you do complete search and before this, you do an
<br>N-deep alpha-beta search where you evaluate each leaf-node position in
<br>the following way:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; 1. Hash the position and look in the exception table.&nbsp; If the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; position is there, use the stored value.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; 2. Otherwise, look up all four edge positions in the edge table and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adding up the results.&nbsp; Do not attempt to be more intelligent
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than that.
<br>
<br>For the alpha-beta search, evaluate each possible next position using
<br>leaf-node evaluation and sort the possible moves by this score.&nbsp; Then
<br>search the next positions in this order.&nbsp; If the returned value is
<br>markedly different from the leaf-node evaluation, add the current
<br>position to the exception table.
