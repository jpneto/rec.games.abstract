Hmm, after having played a couple of games till the very end by
myself, I think my initial concerns regarding the eye cancer rule were
well-founded, after all. Probably because of Go thinking, the Cancer
games played at igGC so far have all ended by resignation just before
the endgame, which is when the problem starts to reveal itself. A
simple example will do:

   . o . .
  . o . x .
 o o o . . o
.. o o . x . o
 . o o . . o
  o o o o o
   o . . o

x = Red
O = White

This looks like the typical position in which Red should resign: White
has an overwhelming material advantage and his group seems completely
alive, yet Red to move has a trivial win. It takes him 9 moves to fill
in White's territories with cancer, whereas White would need 10 moves
to capture the Red stones. There are many more examples like this
where a seemingly decisive advantage turns out to be meaningless
because of the impossibility to ensure life for any group. Also note
that Red would still win in this position if White needed 12, 14,
16... moves to capture the Red stones, but would lose if White needed
11, 13, 15... moves: the parity curse.

I'd be glad to be proved wrong, but if these endgame situations with
capricious outcomes are a common occurrence, as I suspect, deriving
any serious strategical planning for the earlier stages of the game
might be unapproachable.
