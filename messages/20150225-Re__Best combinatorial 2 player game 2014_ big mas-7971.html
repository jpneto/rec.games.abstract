The rules of nomination are really arbitrary. It depends on your kow-tow behaviour.
The game Patchwork winner of gold geek was eliminated!!!!
It is quite clear that this mascquerade award have one goal : to make 2 or even 3 Nestor games as winners! 
NO CREDIBILITY AT ALL!!! 
YOU HAVE THE PROOF THAT ALL THIS CEREMONY IS COOKED!!!
