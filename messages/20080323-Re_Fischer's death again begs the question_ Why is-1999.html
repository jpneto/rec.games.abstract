I'd also say that the BAP system is extremely unfair.  In parti-
cular, in the given tournament, we can probably assume that the
1952-rated player lost all his games, since he was the weakest
player by nearly 300 points.  Half of the people who played against
him were given the white pieces so their `free wins' were worth
only two points; the other players were given three points for
their wins against him.  Mig Greengard and GM Joel Benjamin don't
think BAP is a good idea, especially in tournaments with a wide
spread of player strength.

No.  The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>game<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is biased toward White, at least as currently played.

Yes but he still has to play somebody in every round.  (Or every round

It was Andy May, as you could readily have established by looking at

Mig Greengard and Joel Benjamin aren't `random folks' -- they're
experts in the field.  I provided the URLs for their comments
precisely so that you could evaluate their arguments for yourself but,
rather than doing that, you just dismiss them.  Here are the URLs
again.

I never requested statistical evidence. But the fact that you

Oh, for crying out loud.  It's telling of the fact that this is an

as you cannot produce any concrete evidence against the hypothesis

I have not proposed changes to the laws of chess, but to scoring

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Very well.  You have proposed a change to the way in which chess
tournaments are conducted which, incidentally, changes the default
situation of Article 11.1 of the FIDE Laws of Chess, which states,
``Unless announced otherwise in advance, a player who wins his game,
or wins by forfeit, scores one point (1), a player who loses his game,
or forfeits scores no points (0) and a player who draws his game
scores a half point (1/2).''  I have suggested specific flaws in this
change.  You accuse me of irrationality, fear of change, being
``ludicrous'' and ``disconnected from reality'' rather than
substantively rebutting what I am saying.

Please justify your assertion that awarding less than half a point

It is not any kind of mathematics at all.  You just wrote `mathema-

better.'

No.  Empirically, the half-point draw has coincided with a situation
where contestants occasionally avoid playing real games.

I have nothing further to say to you on this subject or any other.
