Nate,

Thanks for the response.  Trippples was on the cover of Abstract Games
magazine a few issues back and appears to be an interesting game.  I'd
be interested in hearing how playable it is.

Unfortunately, it's not the game I'm looking for.  I've been trying to
recall more detail since this is starting to bug me &lt;g&gt;.  I have a
vague recollection about the royal piece's move being the vector
between two of the other pieces, i.e. suppose the other two pieces
were on squares (1,1) and (2,3), then the royal piece could make a
knight's move.  There was some way in which you could freeze your
opponent's pieces which limited her moves....


Argghh!  I'm sure I saved a reference somewhere.  Just wish I could
find it...

Matt
