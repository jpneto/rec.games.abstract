This seems like maybe an over-strong criterion by which to judge this
effort, if only because I can't imagine any circumstance under which
Go players would ever deem any game better than Go, even if you
created a game that was in some sense actually superior.  Experienced,
dedicated players are both emotionally wedded to their game and can
"see" into it more deeply than they can other games, so they'll always
think it best. The effect is really obvious among chess players since
a few profoundly good variants actually exist, but most chess players
would never admit that they rival FIDE chess for quality.

Moving to a better chess variant is clearly too big a leap for FIDE
chess players, but even making little changes in the rules is seen as
some sort of betrayal. For instance, the rule which makes stalemate a
draw is completely artificial, but nobody wants to change it, even
when draws themselves are a big problem in chess.

I don't know if it's as one-sided as that, but I do see some patriotic
bias in the fact that Japanese players refuse to address the
impracticality of their ruleset, with its illogical life and death
definitions settled by tradition.
