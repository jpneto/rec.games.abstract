You're a gifted man, Graham.  I want to reaffirm what I said the moment you
got here.  Welcome to rec.games.abstract.

Everyone here has a Go variant and a healthy interest in AI.  Graham brings
a lot to the table, especially in the light of Redstone.  How often does one
invent a game for which there are expert players already on hand?  It's
unprecedented.

We need to establish a welcoming policy, other than the traditional
dogpiling.   Can we heave out the moldy, damp, red carpet covered in shit
stains and cigarette burns?  Maybe we could nominate someone friendly, like
Nick, to interface with new arrivals until we can sort out the nature of
their visit.

For my part, I won't gloat about how Go had to wait 3000 years for me to be
born.  Nobody wants to hear me gloat.
