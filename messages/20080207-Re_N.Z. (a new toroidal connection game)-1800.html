The question mark is well placed.  As far as announcements here on

So it seems that having gone off half cocked, and shot his bolt,
Mark Steere has implicitly admitted my claim after all!    ;-)

But who cares about priority.  (other than Mark...)

So am I !  It seems I have gone off half-cocked, at least with this
random comment.  I must have been thinking of something
particular that turned out to be not so general.

There's no obvious reason why, in fact, there shouldn't be
such a game, (locally hex, toroidal, equi-tasked), and
in fact I have constructed one in a parallel post, though
it's not (yet) especially satisfactory.

I still claim, however, a game of extreme cuteness and
considerable "naturalness", with my "N.Z."

N = North and Northwest;  Z = eaZt and northeaZt.
N = Negative slope; Z = poZitive slope.

NZ = New Zealand.      YAY!
