Here is a new variant of Hex.
Instead of dropping one stone of your colour a player  MUST drop 2 stones :

- ONE OF HIS COLOUR 

- ONE OF HIS OPPONENT COLOUR.

The move is mandatory.

The goal of the game remain unchanged : connecting your sides.

What do you think about that?

As a friend of mine remarked a couple of days ago:
"Among the things I have recently learned is that there are rule sets and there are games. Most people design rulesets, not games."

What you describe might be called "Stavropol Hex". There are some obvious differences with Stravropol Checkers:
- Checkers can end in a draw
- In Checkers you can find opponent's moves that are actually bad for him
- Stavropol requires you to either move your own side or the opponent's, not both in one turn

Hex cannot end in a draw, so your Stavropol Hex will eventually lead to a decision. But the moves you make for your opponent cannot (!) be bad, so you have to minimize their 'goodness'. You have to place them as inefficiently as possible. This goes against my wishes as a player. For the record, I don't like Stavropol Checkers for the same reason, but at least you can employ some interesting tactics. That doesn't seem to be the case here.
