I'd like some opinions on these two games.  
Tantrix looks like it has more complexity and a puzzle mode, 
but how do they compare strategically?

In addition, do you have any idea where I can buy either one of those?
I'm in the USA (Texas to be precise).

Personally I usually prefer traditional two-player games with no luck
element, but I really love playing Tantrix. I think the reason is that
it works so well as a family-type board game (especially with four
players) - I have played with many people who would normally run away
screaming at the mention of the phrase "abstract board game" - but it
also works brilliantly well as a competitive two-player abstract of
considerable skill. It is true that there is a luck element in terms
of what tiles you get, but I think (as in Scrabble, for example) that
the luck is considerably outweighed by the skill. The fact that you
can see the opponent's tiles and may be able to force a long sequence
of forced moves to make them help you get what you want allows for a
lot of interesting tactics and planning ahead.

I am sure that you can find out all you need about Tantrix (including
online play which seems popular, and where to buy sets in various
countries) at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.tantrix.com/">http://www.tantrix.com/</a>
