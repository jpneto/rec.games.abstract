What is a new game?
The first reaction to a new game is : how nobody before thought to it?
Simple, elegant, works well, very addictive, easy to learn and hard to master etc...
Now that we know what we have to know how many games fulfill those constraints?
Surprisingly an INFINITE NUMBER (My conjecture)
Why no game designer have at least produced one?
How to reach such result? 
How to think the right way to produce an infinite number of such games?
ha ha ha 

I will post some very new games soon just to bother some fake and crappy "game designer".
New game does mean after all new way of playing.
New game = freshness
