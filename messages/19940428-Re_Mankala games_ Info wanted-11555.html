I am interested in finding more information about any of the old African games

At least two that I know of, but one might have gone out of production.

I'll send you the names and manufacturers and you let me know if you

If you don't know any of these games, I would encourage you to give them
a try. Their deceptively simple design hides a game of complex strategy.
I would say they are less complicated than chess and its variations, but
probably more complicated than draughts.

Definitely less complicated than chess, but they are every bit as difficult
to master as the players develop.  More like the simple game of reversi, 
IMHO.
