 But I can't subject my
excellent game to a moronic public vote.  So instead, I'm offering this
proposal.  If you want to pit your game against Monkey Queen, you'll have to
do it on what I consider to be the only reasonably fair terms, and only have
the contestants vote.

If that's not agreeable, fine.  I will bow out gracefully.  Let me know what
you decide.

Let's wait on the verdict regarding the expert jury.

I think we should discuss the procedure for future contests though.
The 'moronic' public vote is the same one that begets our governments.
"Assholes get elected because assholes get to vote" to cite Timbuk-3.

At the same time it is the only way to get everyone involved and
unless the general public with all its prejudice and likes and
dislikes takes part, it will in my view remain a non-event.

Of course the organization should also be improved. There should be a
team of sorts making applets for all games, and consequently games
should be made within the bounds of what this team can reasonably be
expected to do.

With a gameroom where all games could be played by everyone
interested, and where stats could be used in some way to determine
players' right to vote.
