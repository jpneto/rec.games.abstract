So, I've tried playing with Luis negative feedback rule and with the
Ketchup win condition, and I've discovered a difficulty:

There ends up being a clearly two-phased progression in the game:

In the first phase, both players play singletons for a long time.
In the second phase, it seems there's much more meatballing than with
the original ketchup feedback rule (I can't say for sure but it seems
that way based on my exploration so far)

The reason is that, after a certain point, it's pretty hard to find a
good move that avoids giving your opponent the third stone most of the
time.  So instead you just grow your largest, most central group
almost every time, and a lot of the subtlety is lost.

I could be wrong, because I've only played with it a little bit.  I'd
like to hear what others think.
