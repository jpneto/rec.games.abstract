Has it never crossed your mind that I may not be Chinese, or that I am

increasing dismay and disgust.

Well "Mr Mr Don't Know", that may be your style, but not the style of
the people I communicate with on the web. As far as I'm concerned, you
may be "anybody" indeed, and I bear little respect for people who
operate anonimously, hide behind "Mr Mr Don't
Know" @ spam.spam and try to erase their posts.

By the way, Tourette patients do not usually <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>write<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> profanities, so
you taking this at all seriously - though less so than the profanities
that led to that characterization in the first place - is not very
quick witted :)
Is that why you mention that you are disguising - correction, might be
disguising - yourself "for very good reasons"?
