I had a Eureka moment today, courtesy Christian Freeling.  Christian
has a new game called Symple, the core of which is an inventive rule
specifying how a player may add stones to the board.  The rule is: you
may either place one stone, not adjacent to any other like-colored
stones, or grow any/all of your preexisting groups by one stone each.
A conundrum results: do you add one measly stone so that you have more
groups to grow later, or grow your groups now without increasing the
number of groups?

Meanwhile, I've been trying to invent games where each player's goal
is to have the largest group, but where draws are impossible.  I'm
attracted to this biggest-group goal because it is profoundly
intuitive; humans seem to have an inborn proclivity to try to make
things bigger.  It feels natural to us.

However, it's difficult to design such games because it's hard to
prevent players clumping their stones together, which tempts a
designer to gouge out his eyes and eat them.

I'm proud of the one success I've had so far, a game called Ketchup,
but Ketchup isn't perfect: there's a restriction that you can't place
your stones such that your largest group is the same size as your
opponent's largest group at the end of your turn.  It's clunky and
requires players to track stone counts as they play.  It's no problem
when playing online where the computer does the counting for you, but
I want a game that plays just as well in meatspace as in cyberspace.

When I read about Christian's drop mechanism in Symple, I saw that it
was ideal for my purpose (Although I did simplify it slightly for my
game).  If played on a board with an odd number of cells, it yields a
drawless game without clunky restrictions.   It feels beautiful to me,
perhaps because I've been pondering the problem for so long.

I haven't decided if it's better to include a 12* drop rule, as in
Connect 6, or a one-stone-per-turn-with-pie rule, so I'm including
both versions here.  Let me know which you prefer and why. First I'll
cover the rules, and then I'll explain why it's drawless and why
Christian's rule is critical for making it drawless in a fair way.

Rules:

Byg is a game for two players, played with black and white stones on a
hexhex board.

Version #1

1. The board begins empty.
2. To begin, White puts a single stone on the board.
3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn you may either:

    * Place one or two stones on vacant cells, not adjacent to like-
colored groups or to each other; or
    * Grow any or every existing group by one stone.  A stone
connecting two or three different groups together is considered to
have grown all of them (at the end of your turn, no group may have
more than one new stone in it).

4. The game ends when the board is full, or when a player resigns
5. The player with the largest group wins.   If the players largest
groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so
on, until you come to a pair of groups that arent the same size.
Whoever owns the largest group wins.


Version #2

1. The board begins empty.
2. To begin, one player puts a single stone on the board, and the
other player decides whether to take ownership of the white or black
stones.
3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn you may either:

    * Place one stone on a vacant cell, not adjacent to like-colored
groups; or
    * Grow any or every existing group by one stone. A stone
connecting two or three different groups together is considered to
have grown all of them (at the end of your turn, no group may have
more than one new stone in it).

4. The game ends when the board is full, or when a player resigns
5. The player with the largest group wins.   If the players largest
groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so
on, until you come to a pair of groups that arent the same size.
Whoever owns the largest group wins.

Drawlessness and the Freeling Rule
Because Hexhex boards have an odd number of cells, if you go down the
line comparing the players' largest groups, second-largest groups, and
so on, there must be at least one pair of groups where one group is
larger than the other.  This is true whether or not we use Christian's
rule.  However, if the number of stones that each player puts on the
board doesn't vary as a function of the players' own choices, one
player will be ensured what can be thought of as a tie-break, merely
in virtue of turn order, which is unfair.  Christian's rule allows the
players to have a choice about how many stones to put on the board,
and as result, getting the tie-break becomes a matter of skill, not of
turn order.  Beautiful.  Thank you Mr. Freeling.
