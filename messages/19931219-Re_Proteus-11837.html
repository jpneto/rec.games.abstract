Someone wanted the rules and ordering info for Kadon Enterprise's Proteus.
 From the May/June 1993 (Vol 1.4) issue of The Game Report:

Name: Proteus
Cost: $45, or $59 for the deluxe set
From: Kadon Enterprises
      1227 Lorene Dr., Suite 16
      Pasadena, MD  21122
      (410) 437-2163
Type: Abstract strategy
Players: 2
Skill: 9
Complexity: 7
Playing time: 20-60 minutes

	According to myth, Proteus was a Greek god and prophet with the
distinguishing ability to change his form at will.  I cannot imagine a more
appropriate name for this game from Kadon Enterprises in which the very
nature of the game alters dramatically from one move to the next.  Indeed,
change is at the heart of this elegant game from the people who brought us
Quintillions and Sextillions.
	Rules for four game variations are supplied, all of which are played
on a simple three by three grid (a cloth mat in the basic set, or a hardwood
board with leather playing surface in the deluxe package).  Each player has
a set of three pawns-- one marked by a square, one by a circle, and the
third by a triangle.  The nine tiles are actually squares, circles, and
triangles-- one each in red, green, and yellow, all with holes in their
centers to accomodate the pawns.  Every tile has a rule engraved on one
side-- movement rules on the reds, trading rules on the greens, and game
goals on the yellows.
	In basic Proteus, players begin by placing tiles or pawns on the
board.  No two tiles or pawns can occupy the same space, although a pawn and
tile may do so.  Once all tiles and pawns are placed, players take turns
moving pieces or swapping tiles according to the rules currently in effect. 
And that's the catch.  If a pawn and tile of the same shape ever occupy the
same space, the title is turned face-up so that its rule is displayed.  All
other tiles of the same color are turned face down, and the face-up tile's
rule comes into effect.  Red tiles control how pawns may be moved-- like a
chess king, rook, or bishop/knight.  Green tiles control which tiles may be
exchanged-- tiles of the same shape, the same color, or different "polarity"
(that is, occupied by opposing pieces).  Yellow tiles control the very goal
of the game itself-- getting three in a row like Tic-Tac-Toe, having your
pawns occupy three tiles of the same shape, or having them occupy three
tiles of like color.  Whoever first manages to achieve the goal prevailing
at the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>end<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of their turn wins.
	Winning isn't easy.  It's not difficult to maneuver into a position
whereby you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> win on your next turn-- but there are usually a couple
of ways for your opponent to stop you.  The trick is to set up a win which
your opponent can't prevent.  And that takes skill, foresight, and a little
bit of luck.
	We found that if nobody had won after 30 minutes of play, the game
started to feel monotonous and we'd set it aside and come back to it later. 
Of course, your mileage may vary.
	As always with games from Kadon, the equipment for Proteus is quite
attractive.  The deluxe hardwood board looks nifty on a coffee table.  The
laser-cut wood tiles are well-made and art deco chic, and the simple pawns
complement them nicely.  You'll find that Proteus makes at least as fine a
conversation piece as it does a game.
