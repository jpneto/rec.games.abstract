Hello,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually jumping is not compulsory.  I playtested it with and without
compulsory captures and found that leaving the choice to jump or not up to the
player  made for a richer game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I first played more than 10 games with compulsory jumping, then, after
I read your mail several games, without.

I strongly disagree that it makes a richer game. I respect your decision
and your rules, but I don't share your opinion.

In early Draughts there was no compulsory capturing, this game was called
"Le Jeu de Dames Plaisant" (i.e. "The Friendly Game). It was in the 16th
century replaced by Draughts played with compulsory capturing called "Le
Jeu de Dame Force" (i.e. "The Forced Game"). The reason why it was
replaced are much the same why I view Gorgon played with compulsory
capturing as being the superior game:

Compulsory capturung results in strategy and tactics becoming  more
balanced. I find your game too strategical.

Although your game can be played without compulsory capturing, many nice
techniques are not possible. If you have compulsory capturing, you can
"force" moves, which are beautiful sacrifices. For instance, you can
sacrifice one piece and get two in return, you can sacrifice one piece and
force your opponent in a bad position, you can sacrifice one stone and
have some possibilities to move again, you can sacrifice one stone and
breakthrough to the upper (lower) edge of the board. There are numerous
other possible techniques which are lost to your game, because a player
just wouldn't jump if that's bad for him. It's true: I am very much
influenced by traditional Checker variants (Altdeutsche Dame being one of
my favorite variants, the others are Frisian Draughts and International
Draughts)), but a Checker-like game without compulsory capturing is like
meat without spices or a pudding without sugar. It is sort of a "castrated"
game for me. BTW many new Go variants appear to me like "castrated" Go,
compared to "real" Go.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The game appears to be influenced by "Altdeutsche Dame" (i.e. Old German
Checkers): the starting position, the movement of pieces and the
direction of jumping is the same in both games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In games of material capture, like Chess and Checkers, stalemating an opponent
is never the main strategic objective.  It is far often more of a threat than a
reality.  What I wanted to do was create a game where stalemating an opponent
was the entire point.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, this is a main feature of your game. Checker is, however, a rather
difficult case to discuss. Although the object of checker variants can
be defined as capturing all your opponent's pieces, it would probably more
logical to say that actually it is to immobilize your opponent (which is
even the official definition of the goal in some official Checker variants).
You must move in Checker and, if you can't, you have lost the game. Many
Checker games (played by experienced players) does in fact end in a blockade.
For that reason the object of your game could be viewed as being exactly
the same as in most Checker variants. Westphalian Draughts explicitly
states that a blockade is not permitted. But this is a rare exception and
leads to some rules which appear rather artificial to me.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I determined that the game would require two things:  petrification of pieces
(and by extension, jumping) and a limited, non-retreating movement.  So it was
essentially a Checkers-like game.  Rather than reinvent the wheel, I decided to
go back and look at the various Checkers variants to see if any had any
elements that would complement the game.

The problem with most European Checkers is that they are played on a single
color of the Checkerboard.  If that happened with a game like Gorgon, the game
would be over too quickly.  In Old German Checkers I found where pieces were
played on both the light and dark squares while allowing for interaction
between the two.  So it suited my needs perfectly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's perfectly o.k. to borrow ideas from other games as long as one does
not pretend something else. There are a few more Checker variants such as
Armenian Checker or Türk Damasi (Turkish Checker) in "Europe" (Europe
defined as a cultural space) which use both colors.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Well I've invented a lot more games then just these two.  But I've always been
of the belief that a designer is a poor judge of his own creations.  So I'm
glad you like my two most recent games.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If Chris is reading this, could you tell us a little bit more about
yourself?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not sure exactly what you'd like to know.  But I'd be happy to answer any
questions you might have.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, I know already that you are a very honest person and probably
American.

You probably know that I have included Tourney in my book project (i just
finished my first proofreading). I would include Gorgon, if compulsory
"petrifying" would be an acceptable variant to you.This book does not only
provide the complete rules of a game, but also some background information
(such as history, who is the inventor, tournament life, etc). You could
answer to my e-mail address giving me any information about yourself
which I could publish (profession, hobbies, year of birth, why you invent
games, what are your favorite games...)
