Pie I consider to be 2 steps - one creates, the other choses -

analogue.

In progongued play and with increasing level of play, players can
study certain set-ups in deep, so that they're able to handle both
sides of it. I don't think there's a name for it, but Swish and
Squeeze were the first games I used it in. I'm not sure if I've ever
encountered it anywhere else, but it doesn't seem a very far fetched
procedure and there are thousands of games.

Alas it's not a silver bullet. I'm sure there are artificial games 
where player 1 can set up a situation where whatever player 2 choses,
there's a certain win for player 1. A game with zugzwang would be
a good candidate. A position where one party can play to win, and the
other party can only play to lose.

So you'd need to introduce a pie stage into the process to make it
fair in the face of that. After creating the starting position,
player two should decide who takes on the roles of player 1 and 
player 2 in your above parity-switching choices. 

Yikes, what have I created?!

First of all I would have second thoughts about an initial position
with men in the corners, but if so I'd probably choose to move first.
But a single in the corner isn't wholly trapped: move a double on top
and leave as a triple. In fact trapping singles on the edge is a good
way to saddle the opponent up with time consuming liberation moves.

Of course there may be players who fix a final destination (by making
a stack of 4 or higher) while leaving a single on the wrong diagonal
subgrid. Those are not bright players.
It's also possible to make two stacks of 4. Stupidity is legal ;-)

I'm wondering if one player can simply use herding techniques to force
one of the opponents pieces to become isolated. After that, there's no
incentive to let it go, and the game becomes infinite.

Adding the possibility of breaking up larger piles doesn't prevent 
that.

Even adding a quite radical rule that every small-enough-to-move pile
must always be allowed to move doesn't fix it, as you'd try to herd a 
piece into a bigger pen. And of course, topologically, surrounding an
immobile pile is equivalent to penning in every other piece on the 
board.

So tactics would move towards avoiding being herded. So it's like
a game of just running away from threats, with less incentive to 
actually achieve a winning position. It still sounds too infinite.
