Here's a draw, on a small Twixt board.  Neither player can complete
their goal.
	. . O .

(Ugh.  Twixt is awkward to reproduce in text.)

My vague memory of Twixt's rules:

There are two types of pieces: pegs and bridges.  Pegs go on the grid
points.  A bridge joins two pegs of the same color a knight's distance
(a 2x1 rectangle) apart.  Bridges may not cross one another.

The object is to connect opposite sides of the board with a continuous
chain of bridges.  One player is trying to connect north-south, the
other player is trying to connect east-west.

A move is placing a peg.   I forget when you're allowed to place bridges.
But consider the possibilities:
a. one bridge per turn;
b. any bridges per turn;
c. all bridges per turn;
d. place bridges instead of placing a peg.

And I seem to remember there was something that happened when you ran
out of pegs or bridges, but I forget what.  This can probably be
ignored for now.
