I agree that this is a great list of abstract games!!  I haven't played all
of them, so my recommendations would be in the form of three lists-

1. Games I have not yet played, including Gipf, Zertz, Chebache, Octi, etc.
2. Games that are fun to play.
3. Games that are fun to learn.

Games that I would classify as fun to play include Quarto, Quoridor and
Cathedral.  You can quickly learn enough of the strategy and tactics to
enjoy playing them as games.  Personally I would include Abalone in this
list as well.  Try a game or two and you should be on your way.

Pente,  Othello and especially Go I would classify as games that are fun to
learn.  Rather than setting a near term objective as being able to defeat an
opponent, I recommend that you work together to try to understand the spirit
and depth of the games.  Long before the Internet or even game software
(back in the olden days!), I read about a professional Go championship in
Japan.  Sounded interesting, so I purchased a set and a couple of books on
how to play.  The "game" quickly became trying to make some sense out of the
sample games and the author's comments on them.   In today's world of the
Internet and inexpensive/free software, learning these games should be much
easier and a lot  more fun.

With Pente, I suggest that you start with Gomoku (5 in a row) until you
understand the strong first player advantage.  Then you can graduate to the
Pente or Ninuki Renju rules that are intended to negate the first player
advantage.  There is no sense confusing yourself with added rules, until
they are needed to keep the game enjoyable and competitive.

With Go there are two software choices and I'd recommend using them both.
The first is software that plays the game.  You and your husband can play as
a team against the computer.  Discussing the potential moves and
occasionally comparing your choice to the software's "Hint" should make
learning much more enjoyable.  The other is software that allows you to
display or replay games that have been saved.  Not only can you see and
discuss expert moves, but you can make your own game out of the process.
Before each move, determine what you think the next move should/will be.  If
you guess the exact move you score 5 points.  If you are close to the same
move, within one or two spaces, you score 3 points.  If you are at least in
the same area, within 5 to 6 spaces, you score 1 point.  At the end of the
game, the player with the most points wins ... whether you fully understood
the actual game as played or not.  I doubt that Go fanatics will agree with
my scoring logic, but it is intended to help you focus on the overall value
in various areas of the board, instead of developing the bad habits of
continuing to invest in a futile confrontation.  This way you can have a
"game" with competition, while having open discussions about the pros and
cons of certain moves, as you grow to appreciate the elegance contained
within this game's very simple rules.  And you'll also have someone to share
the befuddlement with, when an expert's move makes absolutely no sense to
you at all :-)

For Othello/Reversi I'd suggest using a method similar to Go.  Othello
software plays at a much higher level, so you may want to select a lower
skill level for the software, then graduate as your skills increase.  If you
play the "guess the next move" game, I'd only use a single 1 point scoring
option for selecting the correct move.  Playing "near" the correct move is
of little value in Othello.

You have made excellent choices for your first set of games, I hope you
enjoy them!!

However, I think it is a game you should have a taste of.

For the rest, Zertz, Quarto, Quoridor and Cathedral are games that I could

instead. Zertz is still one of my favorites.

Abalone, Gipf, and Othello are games that some people like, but that

Chebache contains dice, so I never tried it :)
