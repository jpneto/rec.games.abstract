One of the most appealing things about checkers is that it is a game
with a community, and a history. Regular international tournaments,
official titles, newspaper columns, etc.

What you say is true of international draughts, and was once true of
8x8 Anglo-American checkers.  Today, there is a small organized
checker community, a few tournaments, and little being published (my
weekly internet column is actually one of the few example, along with
some monthly association newsletters).  The checkers era really ended
with the coming of television in the early 1950s.

But to return to the topic of this group: a big advantage for chess is
that you can go virtually anywhere and play.  The rules are the same.
It is truly international.  Checkers / draughts is fragmented, and the
same thing is not true.  What you play in the U.K. will not be what
you play in France, and likely not what you play in Montreal, though
it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> likely to be what you might play in Winnipeg.  Even in the
U.S. you might play "straight" or you might play "pool" checkers
depending on the locale.  In Italy it's different again ... and on and
on.
