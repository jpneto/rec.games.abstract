Chiming in with my own congrats.  Very nice game.  Following up on
Bill's balancing issue, My favorite balancing mechanism for these
sorts of games is a sort of super-generalized pie rule, where the
first player may color in as many cells as he wants with any
combination of both stone-colors, and then the other player decides
which side to take.  I like it because it starts the game off with a
nice puzzle to solve, and means that even incredibly asymmetrical
goals can be made fair.  My pride-and-joy Mind Ninja would be
impossible without it, eg.

But as Mark says, on a cylinder it's not an issue and it's the
cylinder aspect that makes the game, so why bother with anything
else?
