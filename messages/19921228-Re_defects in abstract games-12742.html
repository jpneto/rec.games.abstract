I'll probably regret entering this discussion, but I do have a candidate
for a 'defect free' game.  First my characterization of what constitutes
'defect free' status.

1: state should be limited to position of pieces on the board and whose
turn it is, with no reference to 'previous board positions' and other
phenominon which must be tracked

2: the rules should not admit special cases and be symmetric to all
peices and positions

3: the rules should be stable in a concise way, and not too numerous

While I agree that defect free status isn't all that wonderful of a
thing (as someone pointed out, tic-tac-toe is quite 'defect free' in
this since, but in general is a lousy game), I do sympathise with the
aesthetic quality the original author was trying to put his finger on.

The only interesting games (above the tic-tac-toe level of complexity)
which I can think of the meet this criterion are Abalone, Reversi, and
Dots.  There has been enough talk about the games that I don't feel I
need to repeat their rules, but their simple accounting of score and
very simple rules which belie their complexity is quite inspiring.

Mel
