Addendum re: Two vs. Three Dimensions

If you were to take a regular hexagonal pattern printed on a two
dimensional rubber sheet, and morph it into a three dimensional shape,
creating an irregular pattern with convoluted cells, you'd still have
essentially a two dimensional grid.  Conversely, if you start with a
regular hexagonal pattern printed on a three dimensional shape (such as
a box) made of rubber sheeting, and morph it into a two dimensional
shape with an irregular pattern and convoluted cells, you'd still have
essentially a three dimensional grid.  The "essence" of the shape, in
my opinion, is its original form in its original dimensions showing a
regular hexagonal pattern, not a morphed version showing a distorted
grid with convoluted cells.

By analogy, a mountainous region can be depicted by various means on a
two dimensional map.  That doesn't make the mountains essentialy two
dimensional.

I would be thrilled if Box Hex were programmed for online play.
However, I would ask in advance that the original board as I created it
be used and not morphed in any way.  A morphed board would obscure the
origin of Box Hex as a game invented by me (Mark Steere). And it would
obscure the origin of Box Hex as a three dimensional game - to me its
most interesting feature.
