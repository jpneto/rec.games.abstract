Speaking of Pentominoes, does anyone know how many distinct shapes
you can make using 5 unit cubes (instead of squares) if you allow for
arranging them in space, rather than on a plane?

Don Woods here, reading news on my wife's account...

There are 29 distinct pentacubes, counting mirror images as different.
There's a company in Germany that sells a complete set and that also
offers cash prizes each year to people who solve a puzzle they give out
(to build some hairy shape using all 29 pieces).  I just got 100 DM
from them for coming in second (by random draw) on last year's contest.
Their address is (I think -- my German is nonexistent)

	Pentakubenspiele
	Schonrathstr. 79
	52066 Aachen

Kadon Enterprises, which has been mentioned many times on this group,
also offers a set of pentacubes, though the price was a bit steep for me.
(I don't know how much Pentakubenspiele charges for their set; I made my
own.)  Their set has 30 pieces, but a careful examination of the
accompanying picture reveals a matching pair.  I don't know why they
include the pair, unless it's to make it pack better into a rectangular
solid.  (29x5 doesn't factor too well in three dimensions. :-)
