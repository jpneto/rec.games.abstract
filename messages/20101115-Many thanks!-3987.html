To all those great many who have privately replied expressing
support, offers of help, and disgust at Mark Steere's
despicable (but laughable) attempts to get me into trouble,
MANY THANKS.

Your good wishes are very welcome.  You will also
be pleased to hear that Mark's complaints have been
investigated and found to be baseless, and that
I have been declared free of blame.  As I predicted,
he has confirmed his status as a vicious crackpot.
His penchant for posting private emails to him,
on the net, has also been noted.

You could further show support, by cut-&amp;-pasting and
reposting my message about the new group, every so often,
say once a fortnight, a different person each time, so
bilious Mark can't really make a personal attack on you
via whatever server you have.

Many thanks once again, your messages sing out hope
for Usenet after all!

Bill
