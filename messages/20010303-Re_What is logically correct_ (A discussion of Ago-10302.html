2. The difference between a sandwiched Guard and a sandwiched Queen is
   that a Guard can be placed on any vacant space in the outermost row
   whereas a sandwiched Queen can be placed on any vacant space on the
   board (henceforth called: the DIFFERENCE).

Although this may be in both sets of rules, this is definitely not
the case in Scherer's version of Queen's Guard. Although I do not
have Zillions on my machine to test it and make certain, I have read
the source.
The modification appears to be:

On your turn, if you have a piece which is sandwiched, you must move it,
according to normal movement rules, only it must be to the next outer
ring as opposed to the same ring or to an inner one.
Queen takes precedence over Guards for the forced move.

I suspect the modification comes from limitations in Zillions' engine,
however Scherer's version, accidentally, I assume, eliminated the
inconsistency in Waddington's version of the rules and left a variant
that looks playable, even if it may not satisfy the purist looking
for historical accuracy.
