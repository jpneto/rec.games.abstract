You know what your problem with me is, Clark?  You compliment my games and
you naturally expect me to reciprocate the good will.  Quid pro quo.  Wrong.
 I don't compliment people's games unless I like them.

I know exactly what my problem is with you. My problem is that you
thought your games gave you carte blanche to spam and troll the fuck
out of this site. That's my problem. Maybe the situation wasn't quite
as bad  as I thought it was but still what kind of bullshit is that?
You think people care about what Ralf Gering had for breakfast? No,
they don't they could care less. They don't want to hear what you
think of Arimaa. People want to hear about your games, heck even
Checkers and the Manual Typewriter which clearly had an agenda was at
least a relevant and interesting topic. Whether or not you think
you've ruined this site, you must admit those Tidbits threads
certainly aren't doing it any good.
