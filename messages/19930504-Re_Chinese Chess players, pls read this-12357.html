Hi everyone,

I want to clear some confusion about my program here.
On purpose, I seldom mention my program's features in my last posting.
This is bacause I tend to distribute the program
as a shareware at this point. And I was not sure if it is appropiate
to discuss its features by myself here.
But I found out this has caused quite a bit confusion. Many
poeple think it is not a real chess program, but a chess database or
notetaker.
I don't have time to answer these questions one by one. So
I will discuss the features here so it will save me the time to work
on the program.
It is a real Chinese Chess program. I don't know how strong it is.
But it is not bad. It plays much better than the two PC chess programs
I have. I am trying to improve the endgame, which is the weakest part
of this program. Hopefully it will get much stronger by the
time I release it.

The program has a feature that after you play or enter a game,
you can save it into the openning book. So you can build an openning book
to your heart. I will also put an openning book I built with the program.
One special thing about the openning book is I limit the length of any
openning to no longer than 10 moves. The reason I do this is because
I don't like to see you play a game to an end, and the program is still not
out of the book. Then you really play against a database instead of a
program.
That is why I feel funny when people consider my program as a database.
I do think it is good for people to learn the game if they play against a
database
with games from good players. So I may change this later. But for now,
no more openning book after 10 moves.
I am also considering strip this feature from the program for the first
release. The reason
is I don't have any way to identify different openning books right now.
And I don't want to see a situation where lots of openning books flying
around and people don't know which is which. I would like to hear people's
opinions on this.

The program can play same programs over AppleTalk network. If you use
AppleTalk Remote Access software, you can play over modem line also.
The program only run on System 7 and later.

You can also write and speak to your opponents over the network
just to anoy him/her. Fun stuff, also very useful.

For now, you can control the search depth to control the level of the
program and the time of the game. You can also set a time limit for
the game to play. I haven't implemented a time control by moves/ hrs. yet.
I hope to get it done when I release it.

It should also output the move list by notation. While it should not be
difficult to implement this, I am not sure which notation system to
use.

The above are the main features of the program. There is one thing that I 
didn't think it is that a big deal originally, but it turns out to be
something most poeple want is there is a slider on the board. You can slide
(or click the
arrows at the ends of the slider) to move the games back or forward.
So you can take the moves back. Or after you put a game from a newspaper
into
the program by playing it out,
you can move the game back and fore to study the game. I am considering
putting an learning mode into it so that someone can write their
comments on the moves. And people can read comments while they move the
game
back and fore. It seems to me it is a good way to distribute a game with
some experts's comments.

One feature I would like to add particularly is playing blindchess. But I
doubt
I will have the time to do it.

I plan to release the program in two weeks.  

Finally, I want to  thank specially Eric Slodan, an Apple DTS engineer. An
chess fanatic and a great programmer( my personal opinion), whose wonderful
work make this program possible. Many features of my program is from his
work.  If my program will have any impact on how people use a Chinese Chess
program, most credit should go to Eric.
