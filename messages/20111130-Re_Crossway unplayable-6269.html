I'm not entirely sure about Quaxtep, but the name does indeed sound
like dancing on mud. It looks very promising, but I feel a bit
uncomfortable with the exception, the surrounded C8 point. What made
you decide to implement that (since it clearly feels like a means to
an end rule)?

That one exception is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> an explicit rule, but just an implication
of the rule that you can only occupy a Black square by moving from an
adjacent White square. If all the White squares around a Black square
are occupied by the enemy, you can't possibly occupy that square. It's
inherent in the organism, as you see.

As for the name, Mark, it isn't written in stone. I just mentioned it
to make references easier. Still, most of the games in the quad-board
connection family are already minor variations of each other:
Crossway, Quickway, Query, Quax, Quadrex... In fact, none of these
five features movement of pieces, so the game I suggested does have a
character of its own. Of course, Slither is everything Quaxtep (or
whatever) always wanted to be, which is why I hadn't mentioned it
earlier, but I do believe that it's an improvement on Query.
