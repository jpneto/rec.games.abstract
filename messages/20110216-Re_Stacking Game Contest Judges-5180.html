Ok, let's ask Omar, that is, if there are no objections from

My only reservation about Omar is that he's obviously a huge Christian

The general public (or I must have missed all that fanmail).

As far as judging criteria, I think originality and quality of play are a
good start and maybe that's all we really need.  Thoughts?

Only that these judges presumably know what they're judging, and in
that case there's no need to point out the qualities that should be
taken into account explicitly.

Are all of the games programmed?  I think the programming links should be
included in the game links thread, so people can see the games and where to
play them instead of searching around for programming links after that.

Parquet is out, Splay, MQ and Grabber are programmed for Axiom and can
be freely downloaded from Greg's page:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html">http://splay.webstarts.com/axiomcontestgames.html</a>

Here's a link there to Dieter's Mixtour:

Grabber can now be played (turnbased) at mindsports.nl, MQ will follow
shortly.

Stax, Twisties and Kasanari Shogi have no applets as far as I'm aware.
