Abstract games are in a sense games without a strong theme or

Am I mistaken in thinking that a game whose mechanics could be as easily
explained without the theme is a suitable topic for this group, even if the
game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> presented with that theme? But that if the mechanics are

  Sort of, I guess.  At some level, even Monopoly is an "abstract game,"
albeit a really complicated one.  It's fuzzy around the edges.  I would
say that football is not an abstract game.  Neither is poker.  Neither
is Dungeons and Dragons.  Neither are Quake or Warcraft.  Risk is on
the cusp, IMHO: it's almost a perfect-information game, but it's got
little quirks and things, and it relies heavily on diplomacy whereas
"abstract games" rely most heavily on strategy of the sort that can be
expressed with a game tree.
  As for this newsgroup, IMHO it's <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>de facto<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> aimed at the abstract games
that are "less popular."  You ask or post here about relatively abstract
games that don't fit into any of the other Usenet games groups (i.e., not
so much chess or card games or Tetris; but new abstract games, or obscure
ones, or questions about implementing games using the game tree idea
mentioned above, might be on-topic).
