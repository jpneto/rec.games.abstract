Here is an idea of game.

First : the mover counters. 

Every token has k holes. On each hole a player can place a stone. So the token can move only up to k squares. A value of k will depend heavily on the size of board.
At the setup all the token carry each one k stones.
This condition will give to the players a freedom on where to move. A player can move a token in an direction one per move. As the player move a token he has to remove as many stones as the moves. 3 moves = 3 stones less.
No jumping is allowed.
No pass is allowed.
 
Second : Refueling 

As the token moves it has less stones. So at some step (zero stone) a token can not move (run out of stones). Here comes the second idea : refueling. A token can be refueled as it capture an opponent token by using its opponents captured stones to refuel. Friendly adjacent stone to the capturor token can be refueled too.

Third : Capturing system

A token can capture ONLY an adjacent token carrying the same number of stones or less. A token can either move from a cell to another or capture. On his turn a player perform one of the 3 actions :

- move 
- refuel 
- capture and refuel 

A token stone-free can not capture nor move. Must wait to be refueled to move or capture or refuel.

Using all those concepts the goal is to find :
- which kind of board will be optimal?
- witch kind of cell will be optimal : triagular, square, n polygon (n&gt;4)
- witch winning condition : last one to make legal move? annihilation of your opponent? scoring system at the end of the game?

Until now I have my ideas about how to build the game : on what to focus in particular.

I do not care about the originality of the game. Was it done before or not?
I still can introduce some new mechanism when it comes to the tiny details.

What I want is : few rules, no flaws, few pieces, at most 3 kind of pieces, a game duration around one hour, 

Those are my main ideas for now.
I will update each time I reach an answer.
