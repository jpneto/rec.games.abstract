<br><blockquote type=cite>The answer is - as always - pretty simple: it doesn't attract enough
<br>viewers!
<br></blockquote>
<br>Yes, but.
<br>
<br>The but is that back when we had three television channels, the 
audiences
<br>were high enough for one of those channels, admittedly the minority one.
<br>
<br>Today we have lots of channels, and a viable audience is much smaller.
<br>And chess is not expensive. So in theory it could be possible.
<br>
<br>The problem is I think that if it were stuck in the middle of programmes
<br>that were a complete mismatch to it, it wouldn't get found. And a whole
<br>channel of material that chess fitted into somehow is a lot tougher to 
do.
<br>
<br>In British terms, about your only hope would be BBC4. And to get it 
there
<br>would need someone who cared enough to make it happen. After all as I
<br>type this the next programmes on are foreign language film awards, the
<br>art of Spain and a comedian I've never heard of on what Sundays mean to
<br>him. There are more serious chess players than people who are going to
<br>watch any of those.
