	Then you have misunderstood.  Rather, I have pointed out

mostly bears little resemblance to your characterisation of it.
Certainly there are occasional abuses;  and there are more among
the top professionals than among the rest of us.  But not because
we all "don't look for winning chances".

	Your choice of the word "chances" is revealing.  DavidR
has pointed out elsewhere in this thread that chess is not a game
of chance.  Actually, my personal view is that he is wrong, and
that chess at the highest levels is predominantly a game of chance;
but that's a debate for another time.  But he is right that we
don't -- or at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> don't, for of course I have no access to
the thought processes of anyone else -- think of chess in your
terms.  I don't recognise your examples, elsewhere, where White
"calculates" [say] that he has a chance of 0.3 of winning, 0.5
of drawing and 0.2 of losing if he plays move A.  Chess simply
isn't random that way. ...

How many times do we read game analysis if words
akin to "he took the safe draw"?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	...  Actually, quite rarely;  and surely scarcely ever
with the GM draws that seem to be what you are complaining about?
If two players play a perfunctory 12 moves and agree a draw, then
it scarcely matters whether the draw was safe or not, the players
didn't want to fight, and such games almost never get more than a
perfunctory analysis.

	Of course, positions do arise that are obscure, and where
players have the choice of playing into these or avoiding them.
But if a position is objectively about level, then "punt and hope"
is really a pretty bad way to play -- certainly at the highest
levels.  You will lose a great deal more often than you will win,
unless you really can show reasons why your attack might expect
to succeed.  In <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>good<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> positions, your chances are much better;
and in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>bad<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> positions, any desperate throw may be worthwhile;
but those are not the positions in which draws are normally
offered and accepted.

	There you go again.  "Dominate the game"?  Outside the
very top GMs playing each other, you're talking about around 1/3
of the games in reasonably high-level chess;  and most of those
are hard-fought battles with the draw a fair result.

	You obviously play in different tournaments from the
ones I see.  Well, OK, I know of examples where this has
happened in situations where an outsider really would have
expected the players to work harder.  No doubt there are then
elements of mutual funk.  But we're not privy to the mental
state of the players.  I doubt whether many of them would be
in a better state if they scored only 0.4 for their last-
round draw;  in the example you gave elsewhere, the players
clearly weren't motivated [enough] by large amounts of money,
so the points for a draw can scarcely have mattered to them.

Not really.  You are going to get cases where player A
scores more points than player B [who gets more draws] against
the same standard of opposition, but B gets the higher rating
as a consequence.  Many players are somewhat precious about

	Well, actually the ECF grading system is based around
W-L.  But in any case none of the rating systems I know about
are "purely arbitrary".  They have analysable behaviours.  It
is far from trivial to "use a different definition" and expect
the result to have good behaviour.

	The prize fund [around $20K] is not to be sneezed at,

but because they get quite decent appearance fees, from the
"eccentric millionaires" who sponsor them.  And of course 4NCL
is only one event;  there are other leagues and tournaments
around the world where similar things happen.
