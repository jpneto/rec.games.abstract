Howdy, Steve,

I'd be interested in looking at the blocking pattern you referred to --- I
didn't know there was such a thing!  Is it quickly described, or is there a
webpage about it you can refer me to? I'd like to see if and how it can be
easily adapted to accommodate the orthogonally-attached rule.

The pattern is pretty simple (view the following with a monospace font, such
as Courier New):

    X - - - X - - - X - - - X - - -
    - X - - - X - - - X - - - X - -
    - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X -
    - - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X
    X - - - X - - - X - - - X - - -
    - X - - - X - - - X - - - X - -
    - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X -
    - - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X
    X - - - X - - - X - - - X - - -
    - X - - - X - - - X - - - X - -
    - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X -
    - - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X
    X - - - X - - - X - - - X - - -
    - X - - - X - - - X - - - X - -
    - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X -
    - - - X - - - X - - - X - - - X

Even without the orthogonally-attached rule, it would be difficult for an
opponent to achieve this pattern.  For example, if X makes a move somewhere,
O can play on the smae diagonal (to prevent X from completing this pattern).
X could then try to make this pattern on the diagonals sloping the other
way, but O can block that too.

So if X can't achieve it, what's the problem, right?  I think the problem is
in the density of the pattern.  X has twice the number of moves needed to
make this pattern (pattern requires 1/4 of cells, player X has moves to
cover 1/2 of cells).  So even where X can't make this, she has enough left
over moves to trowell over any holes that develop.

I think I understand the gist of your density argument, but I don't
see a specific way to apply it to the orthogonally-attached game. 
Would you mind demonstrating? (Let's not worry about the restriction
on Black's 2nd move for now.)

Thanks again,

Steve
