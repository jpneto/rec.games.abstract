Rive's game tree is huge in comparison with its boardsize, on any
size, but it is finite.

Go is not finite unless you bar repetition of the same position with
the same player to move. That takes care of ko, theoretically also of
superko. But that can amount to a lot of 'theory' already.

Imagine 3 teams of two players who at all times play <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>legal<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> moves.

Team 1 will try NOT to end the game.
Team 2 are two computers making random legal moves.
Team 3 are intelligent players trying to win, and implicitly trying to
finish the game.

With Rive, all teams will end the game eventually.
With Go, nothing will prevent players of team 1 to legally fill in
their own territory and having their groups captured over and over
again. Theoretically this is still 'finite' because eventually an
identical position will appear ... after 10 ^ 'the number of atoms in
the universe' or thereabouts.

For all computable means and purposes, Go's game tree isn't finite,
Rive's tree is.

So it's the other way around actually: in your metaphor, Rive is Tic-
tac-toe :)

PS. There are games where team 2 is interesting in its own right.
