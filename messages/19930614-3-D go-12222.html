This really doesn't belong to rec.games.go, they're awfully traditional.  I
was sitting watching a couple of friends of mine play go, one a 3 dan, the
other a five dan, when I offered the opinion that both go and bridge
should be featured on Startrek, The Next Generation (no, this doesn't
belong in any trekkie sig, either!).  The 3 dan said that chess would have
been solved by then, anyway, but never go.  The 5 dan suggested that that
might be why they played 3-D chess.  I then asked the question relevant to
this group:  had anybody ever considered 3-D go?  We speculated a 7-7-7
cube, which would approximate the surface area of a 19-19 board, 343
points to 361.  We also speculated chinese rather than japanese
rules,since territory could be problematic.  However, we found it
difficult to visualize live vs dead groups, what an eye would actually
consist of, ect..  So, the question remains: has anybody done any work on
3-D go?
