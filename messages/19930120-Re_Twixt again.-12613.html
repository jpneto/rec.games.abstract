Somebody very kindly posted the entire rules for Twixt ( I think ) but, as I
had no idea how to save the article at the time, I missed it. Could that
somebody ( or indeed somebody else ) post it again? Thanks

Here are the rules as the inventor, Alex Randolph, intended them (I hope!):

Twixt is a two-player (or two-team) game played on a 24X24 square grid of
holes. The players are designated "red" and "black." The edge rows are called
border rows; let us say for the sake of convenience that the top and bottom
rows are red's border rows, and the leftmost and rightmost columns are black's
border rows. The board is empty at the start of a game. Red moves first.
A move consists of three steps:
1. Place one peg of your color in any empty hole, except for those along your
   opponent's border rows. No one may play in the corner holes.
2. Remove any of your links that you wish to remove. You would almost never
   want to do this, except in tight situations where you need the room.
3. You may place a link of your color between any pairs of pegs that meet these
   criteria:
   -Both pegs must be of your color.
   -The pegs must be at opposite corners of a 6-holed rectangle, like a
    knight's move in chess. Theoretically, one peg can link to 8 others:

                    . X . X .
                    X . . . X         A peg placed at C is at the proper
                    . . C . .         linking distance to each of the
                    X . . . X         holes marked X.
                    . X . X .

   -There must be no link of either color which crosses your intended
    link. In other words, a link is a barrier for both sides.
   Usually, it is a good idea to immediately make all possible links to the
   peg just placed. It is perfectly legal, however, to choose not to link,
   and then on some later move make the link, assuming that the link has not
   been blocked. It is also perfectly legal, but not mandatory, to make a link
   that has just been unblocked in step 2.
The object of the game is to build an uninterrupted chain of linked pegs from
one of your border rows to the other. If neither player can build such a chain,
the game is a draw. Note that this chain of pegs does not have to include all
of the pegs and links you have placed on the board.

There is a 4-player version as well. The players are in two teams. Partners sit
opposite each other around the board. Play proceeds counterclockwise (I think)
with no consultation. Once and only once during the game for each team, a
player may call out "privelege" at the end of his/her move, which means the
opposing side loses a move, and the partner may immediately play. Generally,
bieng the first team to invoke privelege is disadvantageous.

Here are some suggested variations on the game:

Handicapping. Change the dimensions of the playing field. The stronger player
would have further to go. It may take some experimentation to determine the
best handicap between any two players.

Equalizing. Some people (myself, for example) may claim that Red has a strong,
possibly winning, advantage by virtue of having the first move. One way to give
both players an equal shot is by going through an "I cut the pie, you choose
the slice" sort of ritual. One player puts two red pegs (possibly linked) and
one black peg on an otherwise empty board, producing a position with black to
move. The other player then decides which side to play on. Play then proceeds
from this position. Another way of equalizing might be to give black a handicap
as discussed above. Maybe reducing black's distance from 24 to 23 would produce
an even game, I dunno.

Monster game. How about 100X100 including border rows?

I posted this instead of emailing in hopes of snaring an email Twixt opponent.
please email me any questions, comments, suggestions. Thanks for your time. :)
