Does anyone recall a game called TEEKO?  

I payed it as a kid, and recently found it (or parts of it) - a box  
of 8 checker-like tokens, 4 black, 4 red, each about 2 inches in  
diameter.  It brought back memories, but not enough...can anyone  
help tell me what the game is?  Am I missing a playing board?  Any  
clues would be greatly appreciated.

It's played on a 5x5 board.  The object is to get either four in a row
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a 2x2 square.  The players
alternate placing one token on any empty square, and if (as is likely!)
neither player wins on the fourth drop, subsequent turns consist of moving
one token to any of the (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) adjacent
cells.

For more details, look for a book by Scarne.

In practice, it sure seems to me as though this game is "clearly" a draw
under rational play, and the only way to win is to capitalize on your
opponent's blunder.  Agree/disagree?

Truly an awful game, even from Scarne's repertoire. A friend and I did
a state-space analysis of it a year or so back, and for the standard 
opening (i.e. without pointing) it is in fact a draw. 

'Advanced Teeko' - a variant where any orthogonal square is a winning
combination - is a first player win with the standard opening. 

The book gives little insight into the game, but a great deal into
John Scarne.
