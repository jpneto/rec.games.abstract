|&gt; Are the users supposed to peer and reach into the box, in order to

|
|No.  There's no need to cut the box out and construct it.  But if you
|were to do so, you would fold the side arms <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>down<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> so the hex pattern
|would appear on the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>outside<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the box, making it easier to play -
|not on the inside.

Then perhaps you should say so, in the rules. The small perspective
image shows the board upside down, does it not?

|&gt;
|&gt; This is essentially a two-dimensional game. It is equivalent to the
|&gt; image at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6972/smallgrid4tw.png">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6972/smallgrid4tw.png</a>
|&gt; Let the blue lines outline the cells which may be played in here.
|
|I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.

Suppose someone were to independently come up with the pattern of
blue cells I show in the above link. That person might argue that
such a board could be distorted into a box shape as you describe,
but it does not change the essential two-dimensional nature of
the game. How would such reasoning be different from yours?


Your game would certainly be easier to play on a flat grid; you could
use tokens instead of markers, and you could see the whole board at
once.

| ...In both cases, the game maintains the topographic
|characteristics of its original three dimensional shape:  Number one,
|the shortest connection paths are around the outside of the middle
|area, not through the middle area.  Number two, there are four
|shortest paths - two for each player - much different from the one
|shortest connection path you have in regular Hex, a path which is
|shared by both players.

Any winning path for one player in Box Hex, short or long, must share
at least one cell with any winning path for the opponent, short or
long. Do you agree?

How do you come up with just one shortest winning path in Hex? It
looks to me that an NxN grid would have N shortest winning paths for
each player. Do you agree?

|No matter how you morph the (three dimensional) box in Box
|Hex, its topographic characteristics will persist.

On this point, we completely agree.


|...  Even an inexperienced player of Hex can make some basic
|observations.  The well known strong first move advantage in Hex is
|due to a tempo asymmetry and a board <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>symmetry<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

So, are you suggesting the board should be asymmetric? Your Box Hex
board is just as symmetric as the regular Hex board.


| There is only one
|shortest connection path in Hex, as I mentioned.  This path is shared
|by both players.  An obvious deduction is that control of the center
|is paramount, whether you define "center" as the center point (in
|which case the first move player simply claims it), or the center
|small area (in which case the first move player easily dominates
|it).

What do you mean by "paramount"? And what does the center have to do
with the shortest connection path?

|I'm not claiming that Box Hex is free of first (or second) move
|advantage.  No game is.  My claim is that with Box Hex's four shortest
|paths (two for each player), all of which travel around the center
|(not through it), the simple symmetry of regular Hex is defeated,
|and the overwhelming emphasis on regular Hex's center area is
|greatly alleviated, as is Hex's powerful first move advantage.

How does changing the importance of the central
area have any effect at all on the first move advantage?

|
|&gt;
|&gt; There have been plenty of alternate maps suggested for Hex.

|Thank you for providing these links.  The boards are beautiful to
|behold.  Other variants of Hex have also been brought to my attention.
|So far, Box Hex is the only Hex variant I'm aware of which is
|essentially three dimesional.
|
|&gt;
|&gt; The pie rule is recommended for all these variants.
|&gt;
|
|As with standard Hex, their single shortest paths travel right through
|the center, making the pie rule an immediate necessity, even for
|beginners.

Uh- Mark, did you actually look at that second link? The square Hex
board? The yellow one? It's also on the second page from the first
link. Count the number of cells distance to connect the black border
rows, if you go adjacent to a white border row all the way. Now
count the cell distance if you go through the center.
