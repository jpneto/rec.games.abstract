This is a follow up post to my prior "Unsticking Chess" one.  To the
end, the purpose of the project is to come up with perhaps a bit of
standardization in names, terminology, equipment look and feel,
equipment needed, classification/taxonomy, and so on, relating to
chess and its variants.  These standards would act as a community
agreed to consensus, to provide a base upon which people can be able
to more effectively communicate with one another, and be able to share
their experience.  It is not meant to impose restrictive rules, but
provide a way to pragmatically facilitate change.  A possible end
result could be a development path chess can take, that would involve
variants in a more relevant way, and enable variants to be taken more
seriously, not just as some gimmick, but something that can contribute
to the discussion.

If this project seems irrelevant to you, and you question why it would
be needed, then it wouldn't be for you.  But I am putting it out there
for people to consider, and of interest, to say yes to, and get
involved.  I personally believe the whole thing should be treated in
an open-source manner, where what is developed from this is usable by
the community, but also has a way for people to plug their own
proprietary creations, and they lend to the conversation, without them
losing the rights to them.  For example, say the Omega Chess people
would want to get their pieces into the conversation.  They would
still retain the rights, and the project would have a way to
accomodate their pieces and rules into the conversation.

If this is of interest, please say so.  Also, please pop into this
thread on the Chess Variants wiki and sign in:

Thank you for your time...
