  Spherical Chess: You would declare every boundry tile to be adjacent.
  Alternately [I think preferably, but who am I?] you could have 
  an "extra" square off of the chess board that was adjacent to every 
  square on the border of the board.

    That's not enough, because chess is a geometric game, not a
topologic one.  You need to define what happens when a piece such as a
bishop moves through this square and out the other side without
stopping. 

    I question whether this is what you want anyway, because in standard
(plane-segment) chess a square is adjacent to three, five, or eight
others, but in your spherical chess, the special square is adjacent to
thirty (!) others.  (It might be an interesting variation; perhaps
strategy would center around control of the special square.)

    A good version of spherical chess would have all the squares be the
same, each adjacent to exactly eight others, or so it seems to me.
Perhaps you could accomplish it this way:

+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A8|B8|C8|D8|E8|F8|G8|H8|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A7|B7|C7|D7|E7|F7|G7|H7|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A6|B6|C6|D6|E6|F6|G6|H6|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A5|B5|C5|D5|E5|F5|G5|H5|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A4|B4|C4|D4|E4|F4|G4|H4|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A3|B3|C3|D3|E3|F3|G3|H3|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A2|B2|C2|D2|E2|F2|G2|H2|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
|A1|B1|C1|D1|E1|F1|G1|H1|
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

    First make file A adjacent to file H; square A,i (for some number i)
is orthogonally adjacent to H,i and diagonally adjacent to H,(i+1) and
H,(i-1) when these exist.  You now have a cylinder.

    Now pinch the ends together: x,g8 (for some letter x) is orthogonally
adjacent to (x+4 mod 8),8 and diagonally to (x+3 mod 8),8 and (x+5 mod
8),8.

    I think you'd at least want to tinker the castling rule, because the
rooks are not where you think: The queen's rook on A1 is already
adjacent to the king on E1 and the king's rook on H1, for example.
