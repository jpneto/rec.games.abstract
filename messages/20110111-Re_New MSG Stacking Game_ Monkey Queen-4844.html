Sorry for the criticism.
In my opinion this game could be improved.

Your feedback is welcome, Gert.

For example the single pieces move a bit too slow.

Excellent observation.  Sometimes there are lonely marches across the vast
board that put a damper on the game.  You're also much more likely to win by
making your opponent burn through all his checkers than by checkmate.

There is a solution here.  Just for information and comparison purposes, I
test played Monkey Queen on a 4x4 board.  I could hardly get through a few
moves without a checkmate occurring.  No lonely marches.  I then tried it on
a 6x6 board and there was a checkmate on move 23 with plenty of checkers
remaining in both queen stacks.  Again, no lonely marches.

Monkey Queen is scalable.  There's a correct board size and shape, somewhere
between 4x4 and 8x8, and it's going to take some play testing to determine
if it should be 6x6, 7x7, 6x8 or whatever.  Once the ideal board is
determined, the number of checkers in the initial queen stacks can be
tweaked.  I'll start it at 12 and if it needs to come down a tad, I'll bring
it down.

Maybe moving the single pieces two spaces per turn
would speed up the game.

I won't be changing the Monkey Queen rules at all except for cosmetic
changes like the board size and shape and the initial setup.  And if I did,
I wouldn't use that rule.  No offense intended.  I don't like multiple moves
per turn in games unless it's a sporadic occurrence like a jump sequence or
a fill-in sequence.
