There's a difference between the potential market for board games as
a whole and the potential market for specific types of board games.
Also the category 'casual games' is not limited to board games and
includes only certain classes of board games.  The market for the
types of games I keep on seeing you talk about (e.g., chess variants)
is unquestionably small.  But the market for other kinds of board
games is huge, especially when you consider that computer strategy
games such as Civilization III are, at heart board games.

This is just the electronic variety.  This is a large market.  Should
be enough to justify there being a table games network actually.

If you're talking about a television network, then I'm not
sure many people will want to watch board games on television
when they can play board games in real time and watch other people
play at board game Web sites like Pogo (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.pogo.com">www.pogo.com</a>) and Igfip
(<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.igfip.com">www.igfip.com</a>, instantaneous moves, no lag time)?  However, cable
networks have been showing people play video games on television for
a while now and even started a 'sports' league and dedicated channel
for it, so I suppose there's an audience for everything.

As far as the market goes, it's already being exploited.  Microsoft
and Electronic Arts (which bought the extremely profitable pogo.com
a while back and recently created a 'casual games' division) bought
exclusive licenses to the electronic versions of many board games
last year.  This is very old news.  The center of gravity is
online, not in television.  If you really want to do see something
happen in the area of television, then why don't you produce videos
of game matches with commentary and edit them down into Webisodes
for general download.  The chess on TV and board games on TV themes
you continue resurrecting under new names and crossposting all
over has gotten tiresome.  Just get out there and do something
yourself and see if it flies.
