With respect to voting, it should be a method everyone agrees on.  As
one possibility, I suggest condorcet voting among the contestants.

As for the proposed feature or mechanic, it should also be something
we're all interested in.  Here's one I'm curious about, because I have
trouble with it:

What you might call a cycling finite game.  The idea is to have a
stones-and-grid affair in which stones can both be added to the board
and removed, through capture or some other mechanism, but where
nonetheless the game is guaranteed to end and give one winner.  Ko
rule is not allowed, and the goal cannot be accomplished by limiting
the number of stones (ala Gipf).

So, one example of this kind of game is Steere's Cephalopod (sp?),
which uses dice instead of stones.  The challenge I have in mind would
restrict the designer to stones.

But there are many other possibilities.  One that Bill Taylor
suggested long ago, but which I find fascinating, is a pattern-
completion game with the Hex-like properties of one unique winner when
the board is full, but where the pattern is LOCAL instead of GLOBAL,
as in Hex.  By local I mean the pattern is not defined by anything
other than the relative arrangement of stones in the pattern.  4-in-a-
row is an example of a local pattern.  The Hex pattern, on the other
hand, is global because it's definition makes reference to the edges
of the board.

Here's another one  (which may be impossible.  I'm not even sure this
idea makes sense): a game with a single drawn state, which can only be
reached by two players who play perfectly.
