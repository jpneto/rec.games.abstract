Just last week I was thinking of using "simultaneous" moves as a general
mechanism for removing first mover advantage, and possibly allowing many
pieces to move in parallel.  This can be done with pen &amp; paper, two boards
with a screen in between, or a program.  One can capture his own pieces.
If opposing pieces try to enter the same empty square, they annihilate each
other.  But if opposing pieces try to enter an occupied square, (only) the
original occupant survives.  The king becomes a moving target!  I think
the game would be a blast :-)

My father and I used to play chess with simultaneous moves (on the honor
system). It worked
something like this:

1. If both moves can be made in either order with the same result, they're both
executed.

2. If only one order is legal, that one is taken.

3. If both orders are legal but give different results, neither move is taken,
and the players try again.

4. If only one move is legal regardless of order, that one is taken.

5. If different moves are legal in different orders, neither move is taken, and
the players try again.

6. There is no check. King capture is a win.

I hope that covers all cases! This was a lot of fun.
