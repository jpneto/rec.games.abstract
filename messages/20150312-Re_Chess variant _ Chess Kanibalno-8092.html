Easy to create a chess variant.
You play chess with all the classical rules but you add a new capture mechanics.
Queen can not capture an opponent queen
Rook can not capture an opponent rook
Bishop can not capture an opponent bishop
Knight can not capture an opponent knight 
Pawn can not capture an opponent pawn
King can be adjacent (orthogonal and diagonal) to the opponent king.

All the gameplay will change! 
Why? Because pieces are going to be used as blocking pieces.

Try it! 

I hope you will like it.

It's been done already. I actually looked at this because some think you are a decent designer, and if you hadn't been anticipated, I might have suggested you offer it to the chessvariants.org website. The best I can get out of this is now you seem to be using Kanibalno capture as a mutator, a la JP Neto. But it's been done. In fact, the inspiration for the anticipation is the Lion, an extremely powerful short range shogi piece: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/lion.html">http://www.chessvariants.org/piececlopedia.dir/lion.html</a>

How can you say that it was already done?
Even in the classical chess game you will find a rule a piece can not capture another similar (example of the king).
Does this mean that a particular rule aplly to all the pieces?
Let us take the example of checkers.
You need to jump over ONE checker to capture it.
Assume that I as game designer imagine a game where you need to jump over 2 checkers (not ONE) to capture them. Will my game be a simple variant of checkers or something else?
Is it a minor modification or a major one?
What you do not know is WHEN a new rule create a real new game?
WHEN a new rule add only complexity (or simplification) to the game?
WHEN a new rule broke the game making it boring to play?
Rules can improve the game or make it worse.
The best rules are the one`s reaching the optimal gameplay.
Not easy to produce them.

I'm going to surprise you Moh, and agree with you. It is extremely difficult to tell, beforehand, how a new rule or game is going to work out. As for optimal gameplay, that's a tough question also. What I aim for is good gameplay in an intellectually challenging game. Then I listen to the people who play it, and see if they think there is room for improvement.

I think we will always disagree on what is original and what isn't, because we look at games in different ways. I've said before you are a splitter and I am a lumper. That is a major difference that always leads to disagreements. We can just agree to disagree. I have no problems with that, and I accept that each of us will think he is right and the other is wrong. If everybody thought alike, the world would be dull and uninteresting.
