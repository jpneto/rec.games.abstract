It nearly fully fits my criteria, and it very nearly has the effect it
has on hex.  so havannah does fit my criteria (criteria 2.  draws are
not a concern in human play, so no draws, offensive and defensive play
both exist, but you are not limited to only offensive or only
defensive play with the available moves with or without pie rule, so
it isn't a concern.  Offensive and defensive play only indicate
whether you have to look at the moves if they are offense or defense
only [like chess with pie rule has all the best pie rule options as
defense only][and even if it was a concern, the fact that you don't
have to build off a move for it to give a positive effect would still
mean pie rule is advisable, just not as good as it is in hex]).

75% is my best guess based on my vs my best opponent (the AI program i
built).  I am about 200 elo better than the program.  I win just over
half of my games against it [15 seconds per move] when it plays white,
where was i a bit more than 90% of the time when i play black.  This
means that first move is worth about 200 elo.  the ai program playing
itself also comes to the same conclusion (75% of wins are as white[it
plays with the variables each attempt so that hte games arn't all the
same as it narrows in on the correct weight for each indicator]).  200
elo is ~75%.

As for the 72%, that looks precise, but really wasn't meant to be.
Based on the loss of mobility throughout the game, i have white as
holding between 80 and 90% of his advantage with worst first move, so
i guessed 85%.  85% of 200 is 170, 170 is 72.7%, which i rounded down
to 72% to give the pie rule the benefit of the doubt.  the computer
only wins 70% of the time against itself, though, however i beleive it
is playing the opening wrong, so i tossed it in as the secondary
number.  I do not have significant play vs the computer with pie rule,
so i can't be more precise than that.  Also human vs human play, or
play at longer time controls, is thus far untested.
