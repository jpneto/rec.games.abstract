Games without this feature, such as your own,
may still be very playable, but are much more in the nature
of "race games", wherein both can achieve a victory position,
but whoever does it first, wins.  There is nothing wrong with this,
but it is just not usually considered as part of the Connection
game tradition.

When you say it like that, I see something which might be important
for implementation of playing programs: In games without races, you
can just ask players to play out and check for a win at the end,
rather than checking after every move.
