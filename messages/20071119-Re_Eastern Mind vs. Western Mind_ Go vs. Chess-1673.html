The observation that both Chess and Go come from Asia, if I may say so,
misses the point. Chess, regardless of where it comes from, is more of a
"force on force" game that is more commonly popular in the West, and in
particularly in America, where such games as football and boxing have
helped shape the popular imagination and given us metaphors for war and
other forms of conflict.

In contrast, Go, a territorial game of maneuver, has had a hold on Asia
that Xiangqi, Shogi and international Chess have never attained
historically. Businessmen of Japan and military leaders of China often
express their strategies in terms of Go whereas their American
counterparts would never do so.

I can understand your "force on force" comment, but what does putting
stones on a board have to do with "maneuver"?

Is it a mere coincidence that many American businesses do not look

You are better off looking at the nature of eastern vs western minds
and how it relates to why games were adopted rather than this.
However, I believe that the idea of the way business works east vs
west is entirely different.

So, yes, to answer your question, Chinese Chess is less Eastern than Go
because it represents a "force on force" paradigm that has not been as
influential as the territory/maneuver paradigm of Go in China. The
former paradigm is predominant in the West in general, and in America in
particular.

I look forward to your reply.

Again, what does force on force have to do with maneuver?
