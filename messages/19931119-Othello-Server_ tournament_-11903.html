The new Internet-Othello-Server (telnet faust.uni-paderborn.de 5000) is
great!  Thanks are due to Michael and Igor for putting it together.  The
latest version is fantastic, with all the features I could want.

The only problem I've found so far is a lack of people using it.  Partly
this is no doubt due to the fact that Othello is a less popular game than
chess or go.  Nevertheless, I'd urge Othello enthusiasts and novices to
try it out!  It's a lot of fun!

I was wondering how many people would be interested in participating in
a tournament on the server.  I think the best way to run such an event
would be to announce the pairings for a round, then let the players get
together and decide on a time to actually play the game.  This would
avoid problems due to differences in time-zones.  Please let me know if
you're interested in something like this (and include your suggestions or
preferences if you think it would be better another way).  If there's enough
response, I'll organize pairings and we can get this going.

If you're interested, we're going to have to decide whether to allow computers
to play or not (or whether to have a separate tournament just for computers).
We'll also have to decide on time controls and the length of time given
to each round (if it isn't held real-time).

Hope to hear from you!

Colin
