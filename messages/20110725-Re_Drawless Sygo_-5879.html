I have to disagree.  Supeko is an ugly rule because applying it
requires the players to keep a record of all previous board
positions.  It's unesthetic, artificial, and impractical.  Why turn a
strategy game into a test of memory or record-keeping?

It may depend on what you call superko. The name addresses cycles of
ko situations in Go, and forbidding the repetition of an identical
position with the same player to move doesn't lack elegance but
practicality.

If you take the term as general for a problem in some abstract games,
there's no escaping the problem and it_must_be_addressed. Again:
nothing ugly about it except if you implement the solution in an ugly
way.

Also, you make it sound as if its a frequently encountered problem.
But it usually isn't, and those most likely to encounter it (other
than a simple ko, or a simple 3-fold) usually play at a high level and
have no memory issues regarding a game's trajectory.

I happen to think it lacks both elegance and practicality and I don't
see a way to implement it that is not ugly.  The 3-fold rule in chess
is one of its weakest and most problem-inducing features.  And the
argument that it doesn't bother professionals who can remember all
previous board positions doesn't relieve it of its relative
impracticality for other players who have not yet reached that level.
After all, no one is born a grandmaster.
