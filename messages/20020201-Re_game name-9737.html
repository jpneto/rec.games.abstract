"The Family Book of Games" by David Pritchard (1994, Brockhampton Press)
lists details of a very similar game with an initial allocation of fifty
points and no suggestion as to how large a lead in wins is required
under the name "Footsteps". I've never seen any other references to the
game apart from that so believe that to be definitive.

On the "other (possibly) relevant information" side of things:

I once ran a very similar game postally for nine players, on the basis
that each player's contribution was compared to each other player's
contribution that turn and individual win-loss records were kept for
each possible pair of players, a three-win lead being sufficient to win
the match between the two players. It was passably, but not hugely,
interesting.

A gentleman from London called Pete Birks gave six pounds to charity in
an auction at a games convention for the right to have a lady from Essex
called Lee Edwards name my postal game "Sudden Death Drag". Given that
you're posting from ox.ac.uk, you might want to ask one of the older
members of the Oxford University Diplomacy Society for more information
about it. It's a long story and not especially interesting...

Best wishes,
Chris
