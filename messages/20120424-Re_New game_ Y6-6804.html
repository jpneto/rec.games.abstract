Not to be a downer (well, ok, to be a downer) but this game does exist, and in fact has been invented by several different people. I don't have time to collect the references now, but they're out there. I don't know if Bill Taylor still reads this but I know that he could provide references as well.

I've also spent some time trying to remedy a problem associated with this game:

However, I would like to know more about problems associated with this game.. Whether the game has existed before does not matter much. I still would like to play it. Obviously with the pie rule in place there should be some opening moves where the result is not clear. So what is the problem? It seems obvious to me that playing on the edge is a poor opening move and playing in the center a very strong move. It follows that somewhere in between there should be a move / moves which allow an interesting play. I also cannot believe that on a hexhex board with side 10 there is a trivial winning strategy. In fact after playing for a while on a board with side 6 and side 8 I came to believe that side 7 would be enough for a quick but interesting play. That is why I posted such a board. I look forward to hearing more about this game.
