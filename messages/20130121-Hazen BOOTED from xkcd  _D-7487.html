When these "new game" threads first started appearing, I was a bit on the fence. They weren't puzzles, that much is certain, but there was some logical analysis that could be fruitfully engaged in, so, what the hell, I let it go.

Since then, there have been more than half a dozen topics about these games, and, what initially had some interest for logical analysis, now has very little. Having devolved into an argument over what constitutes plagiarism, I feel that this experiment has run its course.

So, new rule (or rather, a somewhat stricter enforcement of the old rules about what is and isn't suitable to be posted here)

No more abstract games or puzzles from Combinatorics123 [Monsieur Buffoon]. No more discussion in existing threads (I'll be locking them down now).

Where will you announce your "revolutionary" games now, Monsieur Buffoon?  I suppose you can still post them here [sigh] even though they're all either flawed, unoriginal, or totally pointless.  Some "revolution", lol

You came here to teach us "fake designers" something, Monsieur Buffoon.  Instead you treated us to the spectacle of your desperate, failed attempts to salvage your flawed games. 

Oh well.  Better luck in your next "revolutionary" endeavor, Monsieur Buffoon.  What a waste of a sperm cell.  You should have been aborted in a subway toilet.

Have fun at the mall, BOZO!!!!
