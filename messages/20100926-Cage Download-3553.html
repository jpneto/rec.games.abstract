This is really the place to start with Cage, for a couple of reasons:
First, just to make sure you understand the rules.  Cage is a little
complicated.  There's the notion of the centering move, one which
reduces the straight line distance between your checker and the center
point of the board.  Sometimes it's not real obvious to beginners
which moves bring them closer to the center.

Everyone has their own way of understanding centering.  You have to be
cognizant of the two main diagonals and the center point of the
board.  It becomes second nature after a game or two.

Another reason to play the download first is so you'll have a superior
opponent, someone (the AI) who can show you some proper tactics.

There are a lot of parallels between Cage and Oust.  Both are violent
games with very effective churning mechanisms, keeping the tension and
the violence going until someone is inevitably wiped out.  Both are
counter-intuitive in the sense that you should not kill everything
within reach in the opening game. Comebacks are not unusual in Cage or
Oust.  An army of one can wipe out an army of many.

Games have to be good.  They have to be robust and scalable.
Mirroring has to be either non-productive or easily thwarted.  Games
must have architectural interest.  They need an impressive game tree.
There are objective ways to measure game quality.  Let's focus in on
the state of the art.  There's too much "Oh I designed tickle me Elmo
on a fuckin' stick.  Or I programmed that.  Isn't that clever?"  No,
it really isn't.
