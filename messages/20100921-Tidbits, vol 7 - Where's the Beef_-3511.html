Clark, I don't have a beef with you.  You're a textbook psychopath,
but you've earned my respect as a designer with Particle Bond.

As long as I'm coming clean, Ralf Gering has also earned my respect
with Kauri.  I like the concept.  Oddly, Kauri is either non-decisive
or infinite, depending on which version, but as I've become fond of
saying, not everything has to be my thing.  Rest assured, Ralf Gering
is not flattered by my compliment.  In Ralf's tortured mind Kauri is
finite-decisive and I'm spreading malicious lies about his game.

Ralf has constructed a bizarre universe in which he is an unbiased
"scientist" who objectively "studies" me, a desperate rationalization
for his unbridled obsession.

Responses to Corey Clark's post "The Test of Time" on bgg:

"Are you joking when you say Go is a diamond in the rough?" - Patrick
Carroll

"It speaks volumes that you could not come up with the point of Canvas
when pressed for it here on BGG." - Benedikt Rosenau (Zickzack)

"I really feel you're changing tracks and dodging the argument here,
Corey Clark." - Kornfuck

"Dismissing the vast majority of people as "swine" isn't going to
endear you to anyone or accomplish anything beyond maybe swelling your
own ego." - Patrick Carroll

"Your outbursts and dramas help in clogging up one of the few forums
where it would actually be possible to have a decent discussion about
game design." - Benedikt Rosenau (Zickzack)

Man you're just getting abused on bgg, and rightfully so.  You
pontificate about which you know little. Kornfuck is certainly
flagging every one of your posts as offensive.
