the rule of the double-three is part of Go-Moku.  it is a "defect" in my
view, a necessary blemish on its purity.  (the "ko" rule in Go is its
"defect" and has had an accidental side effect of creating a very nice
feature, the ko-fight.  some "defects" in some games have absolutely no
function otherwise, such as "en-passant" pawn capture - now how in- what
was the circumstance that led to that rule??  i'd like to go back in time
and see where they came up with that one...:-))

Basically (as far as I understand from my sources), the original games of
chess (Shatarunga, and Chatranj) did not allow the pawns to jump forward
two squares atthe beginning. This lead to very slow games as it took
quite a while to actually bring the pawns into contact (this is why Burmese
and Siamese chess start their pawns on the third and fourth ranks). To
help solve this "defect", the pawns were allowed to makean initial move of
two squares rather than one if desired. However, it was felt that this gave
too much advantage to the player moving the pawn since he could skip by
a guarenteed capture if played at the right time. Thus, the "en passant"
capture rule which allows an enemy pawn to capture the first after the move
was made as if the player's pawn was only moved one swuare rather than two
(whewwww, that was rather long winded :-).

the search for a game without defects continues.....

Good luck!  If you want "no defects", try Hnefatafl (or any of its variants).
