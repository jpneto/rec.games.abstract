The Jungle Game also appeared in an issue of Games magazine a number of years
back.  I glued the board &amp; pieces to cardboard and cut them out, they had
very nice artwork.  Sadly, I lost them a long time ago.  Anyone who knows the
exact issue they appeared in, or better still, has a copy, I would very much
appreciate any leads!
