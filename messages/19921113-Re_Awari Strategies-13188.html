This is an old game with many versions and variations.  My e-buddy
and I know it as Mankala and have been playing it via e-mail
for over a year.  We like to do variations on the 'length' of
the board and the number of beans starting in each pit.  We've
also adopted the convention of keeping with single digits, which
first required going to hex, and then beyond!  Recently we used
up all the numerals and both lower and upper case letters...

The rules we play by allow multiple extra moves, and you can get
some real sweeps going if you play your, uh, beans right... :-)
We've recently added a new rule that allows a player to 'steal'
one bean from the other's home pit each time he or she passes it
on wrap-around play.

Very highly recommended -- try it, a fun, challenging, interesting
game, and easily playable by e-mail to boot...
