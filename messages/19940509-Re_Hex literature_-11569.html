Hmmm... I don't really have access to the magazine anymore, so I'll post from
memory  :)  

"Y" is a game played on a triangular board, with a triangular lattice a la
Chinese Checkers.  Almost.  In the original version, it was a normal triangular
lattice, but the game theory created an easy win for player one.  So then they
made three of the points have only five connections instead of six.  I think
the lattice has 8 points on a side, but I'm not sure...

That's how the triangular lattice works, I can't describe it much better than
that.  As for game play, it is just like hex: players take turns placing pieces
in an attempt to connect sides.  Here, you have to connect all three sides;
thus "Y".  

Hope that helps!
