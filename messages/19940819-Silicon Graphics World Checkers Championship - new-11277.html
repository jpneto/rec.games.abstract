For reasons of ill health, Marion Tinsley has resigned his
World Championship match against Chinook.  Six games had
been played, all draws, with 24 games remaining.

Chinook is now the "man-machine" world champion (as opposed
to the "man-man" world champion, a title reserved exclusively for
humans).

This is not the way we wanted the match to end.  While we wish the
best for Tinsley's health, nevertheless, we are all very, very
disappointed.

Don Lafferty, the world's number 2 ranked human player, has agreed
to come and challenge us for the title.  We will begin a 20 game match
with him on Saturday.
