Mark,

Although you may consider this a minor accomplishment, I think it's
actually pretty cool. I don't think that improving "architecture"
always leads to better gameplay, and in fact sometimes the two seem to
move in opposite directions. I end up rejecting a lot of my ideas
because they improve either architecture or gameplay but not both.

So it's a cool thing when a design choice improves both. It's too
early for me to level any verdict about Red, but the early signs
suggest that you may have done that here.

p.s. I wish there were a different word to use in stead of
"architecture".  While I agree there needs to be a word that stands
for "balance, finitude, drawlessness, and simplicity", "architecture"
sounds 10x too pretentious.
