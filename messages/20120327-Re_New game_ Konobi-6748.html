'a' is a legal move for Black. It's only weakly connected to c2, but all the available placements (b2 and d2) which would be strongly connected to it would also be weakly connected to some other stones.

I don't know Luis. The placement conditions may be sound, even 'architecturally sound', but I fear strategical clarity is blurred by the amount of visual dexterity that is required. Of course experience tends to overcome much of this in the long run, but it seems quite a hurdle to me in this particular game.

Yes, that's a reasonable objection. I just hope people will find its gameplay interesting enough to compensate for this. For me it does, but I'm most likely biased :)

Here is a (badly played) sample game:

I played the game (11x11) and won it by creating just one diagonal
(weak) connection. The game seems very interesting. It is similar to
Slither in that diagonal connections are prohibited. Similarly as in
Slither it takes a while to get a feel for what is allowed. The X
pattern serves only to avoid races, it has no other practical
application (it may have more meaning in advanced play). Konobi may
turn out to be more interesting connection game than Slither as in
Slither it is very difficult to make predictions and visualize the
effect of moves due to the "moving sands" effect. Congratulations for
another excellent game! Well done.
