I am trying to contact the person(s) who are responsible for all final
decisions regarding the game CHAR, formerly published by Bechter
Productions.  I am very interested in the game, and any information
that anyone can provide about the current owners and/or publishers
(who they are and/or how to contact them), or about the game's future,
would be much appreciated.

Please respond either to this thread or by e-mail.

There is of course the possibility that I'll get spammed from having
my e-mail address on USENET so I recommend that you do reply to the
thread, even if you reply by e-mail as well, unless you feel your
information is kind of confidential, as a mailing address might be.

Also, anyone wishing to discuss CHAR strategy, or the "History of
CHAR" in the instructions, please reply.  Restrict strategy and
history replies to rec.games.abstract please.

Thank you, everyone, if you're still reading :)

PS- I am posting from Google and for some reason I can't post to
rec.games so could somebody please do me the favor of copying this
post to that newsgroup as well?
