in games where there is a massive advantage to playing first, (most
of them !), how to try and overcome this.

But now we have just seen posted a simple equalizing method, by David
Bush, (in a post about Twixt).  It seems applicable to almost any
game, is very simple, hardly changes the play of the game at all, and
seems very fair.

PLAYER ONE just plays 2 moves for white and 1 for black. Black will
move next.

PLAYER TWO then elects to be either black or white. The game proceeds
normally.

This sounds like a brilliant General Principle.

However, I haven't been following the Twixt thread so can someone
explain why you need three moves rather than two?  Why not have PLAYER
ONE make one black move and one white move, so black moves next.
PLAYER TWO can then choose to either be black (and make the next move)
or white (and let PLAYER ONE make the next move).

Is the reason that it is harder to equalise a game in two moves than
in three?

As Bill points out, this is like the "one person cuts the cake, the
other chooses" algorithm.  Martin Gardner once gave a generalisation
of that to N people.  Could the same be done for an N-player game?

So Biggs, you're the idiot who bought all these IBM PCs.  You're fired!
