Equalization in chess doesn't seem to be a good idea.
It does not avoid the necessary of learning analysed
openings. Quite the reverse. Consider the following
situation:

Player A is a specialist in a certain opening.
Player B feels very uncomfortable playing this opening.
With his first two white and one black moves he can
force the situation on the board to a preferred
structure. Now he is able to play the game with both
white and black very well (because he has learned the
analysed theory of this opening). But player B hates
this opening, no matter whether he elects black or white.
So Player A has got a big advantage.
