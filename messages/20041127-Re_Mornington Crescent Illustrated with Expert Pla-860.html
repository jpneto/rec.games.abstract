I'm grateful to the contributor who requested more information about some of
the most famous players of Mornington Crescent.  I have limited my response
to players of the twentieth century and modern era, so as not to embroil
myself in the Asia-European "Mornington Divide" controversy of the
nineteenth century.  Reports of eighteenth century and earlier Mornington
Crescent figures mostly rely on Harley Moffat's "The Origins of Mornington
Crescent: A Historical Reinterpretation".  But in my view Moffat was misled
by biased sources, and I am still in the process of writing a refutation for
the Mornington Crescent Journal on this subject, so it would be premature
for me to publish my views in this forum.

Hall of Fame

The two greatest players in the first part of the twentieth century are
Hungarian genius Tibor Hugo (1909-1950), winner of the world title twelve
times in thirteen years, and the brilliant Englishman Sydney Ernest Hall
(1870-1950), who won an astonishing 1,821 of 2,155 internationals.

Although Mornington Crescent is traditionally a male-dominated sport, the
latter part of the twentieth century saw the emergence of some excellent
female players, especially from the United Kingdom.

Indisputably the most famous Mornington Crescent player ever is the
legendary Mrs. Trellis of North Wales, a life-long devotee of the sport, who
dominated the game for several decades after the Hall-Hugo era.  Now in her
90s, she has retired from active competition, but continues to make an
important contribution to the world of Mornington Crescent by her frequent
correspondence, in which she shares her insightful analysis and
observations.  While in her prime, the remarkable Mrs. Trellis won a grand
total of twelve international Grand Slams (the Singles, Pairs, Team and
All-In titles), a record that has stood unequalled to this day.  Despite her
advanced age, her advice is still much sought after and respected by
Mornington Crescent experts around the world.

The British in particular have produced some excellent female players, such
as Helen Michelle Long (1935-1966), whose brilliant career was unfortunately
cut short at a young age when she was accidentally electrocuted while
repairing her toaster, and Maxine Burnaby-Short (1925-1992).

One of the modern masters of Mornington Crescent is Boris Antonovich
Baryshnikov, who is again showing signs of the early promise displayed when
he won the 1983 World Championship Final.
