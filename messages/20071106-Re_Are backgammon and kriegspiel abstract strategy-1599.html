Bit of a can of worms, the difference between tactics and strategy.  But
I think that the absence anywhere of someone talking about "abstract
tactical games" suggests that the usage isn't military and for these
purposes there's no distinction drawn between the two.

But if your definition of strategy is 'anything that requires thought',
then there are a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of strategy games out there. Pretty much any
game that's not pure chance, in fact.

There's a line with pure luck at one end and none at the other (aside
from luck of your opponent making a mistake or the like).  My feeling is
that "strategy game" occupies an area starting at the pure skill end of
the line and working back down part of the way, though the fraction of
the full line it takes up is open to interpretation.  It would be a
reasonable thing to cut off at pure skill, as that does give you a clear
point, but OTOH Backgammon requires rather more depth of thought than
Noughts and Crosses, so is arguably more strategic...  Another can of
worms, in other words.
