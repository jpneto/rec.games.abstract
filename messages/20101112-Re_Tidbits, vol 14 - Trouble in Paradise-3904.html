If and when Bill wants to discuss anything game related, I'm in for
it. But I'm a prime target to be ignored, ridiculed and belittled in
some places no doubt.
Dave Dyer for instance has painstakingly ignored all my games,
although he found a better use for a Havannah board in Pünct. He
currently organizes a Hex tournament for humans, starting his
announcement with "There's quite a bit of activity writing programs to
play Hex and competing them against each other ...".

That's interesting stuff. But why would would the results of those
excellent programmers at LG who prepare for the 2012 base-10 match
against me, in which I must score 10 out of 10, be less worthy of
attention? The likes of Timo Ewalds, Ingo Althofer, Thomas Reinhardt,
Richard Lorenz, Richard Pijl and Magnus Persson, to name a few?
This has all the characteristics of a boycot of Havannah, and that may
go back a long way, to when it first disturbed the family that was
(and still is) wrapped up in Star and Y.

So I'm all for a polite exchange of ideas and all, but it takes two to
tango.
