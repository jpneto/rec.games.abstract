<div class="moz-text-flowed">I've never heard of the "exactly one" variant.&nbsp; That does not
<br>mean that such a variant does nto exist.&nbsp; However, every version
<br>of the rules I've seen has been the "all sets" version.

<br>When my father taught me how to play Reversi, I was told that when I
<br>placed a piece, I could "revert" exactly <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> line of my opponent's
<br>pieces, until I reached another one of my pieces behind them. So, if
<br>there were several lines leading away from the new piece I just played,
<br>I would have to choose one of them to capture. Only later I discovered
<br>the other variant (where you capture <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the possible lines of enemy
<br>pieces).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately we have misplaced the original rules insert to our Reversi
<br>game, so I can't check there. What I would like to know is this: Does
<br>the first rules variant I mentioned above exist at all, or is that way
<br>to play Reversi I mentioned above just wrong?
<br>
<br>Thanks for any information,
<br>
