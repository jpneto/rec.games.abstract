I have spent some time trying to figure out how to play a game called
Crossway and came to the conclusion that it is unplayable. The reason
is that there are 8 directions in which a chain can be extended
(compared to 6 in Hex) and only one blocking mechanism in the form of
the X pattern. Unfortunately the mechanism is very weak: you need 2
stones to cut off just one diagonal direction, all the other ones
still being available. As a consequence it is almost impossible to
stop an advancing chain - a minimum of 7 empty lines are needed for
that.

Blocking generally requires more room than one might expect. It took
me several games to figure that out. I played against fritzd in
Crossway game 109. I made lots of bad mistakes in that game. I believe
a better example, my only victory over Paul, can be found at

In particular, please take a look at the position after move 9:

My move 9.O9 is an example of playing the whole board in Crossway.
With the support of the three other black stones on row 9, a
connection to the top seems likely, and at the same time, I can create
a double threat on the bottom, either to connect down from O9, or to
punch between white's H12 and K10 stones. At least, that was my plan.
Just because it worked in the game does not imply it was a good move,
of course. But I believe O9 represents the sort of thinking one needs
to adopt in order to play Crossway well. It's a very fast and tactical
game, not unlike Twixt. But IMO it is not unreadable. I think it's a
great game.
