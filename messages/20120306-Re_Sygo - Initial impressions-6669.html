Sygo on hexhex would be very interesting I think, on a reasonably large board (assuming hexhex is a la Havannah). The reason I like the idea in principle is I think growth feels more organic to me on a hex board, and I think the capture dynamics will be neater. In our game, captures occur almost implicitly of separation of non-large groups, so I think draw rates will be low as there will be a lot of mutual separation going on. It also realistically takes 7 stones to create life on either board (without a crazy loss of momentum from a single stone move, which is unlikely to be worth it for a single small group early on). Territories will be smaller, but the inter-group dynamics will be more fluid I think - in our game, once I'd marked out my initial interests I just expanded without much you could do about it. Hex movement allows for a greater variety of interruptions on expansions.

I don't know, I just think there's a certain clumsy albeit unstoppable factor over the orthogonal growth that wouldn't be present on a hexhex board.

I have a suspicion that this game will be a "reasonable" Go variant, but an "excellent" go/hex hybrid, prior to actually playing the latter of course :D

There's an inventor in there I see :) Considering your arguments I see how you could be right. Maybe I'm just a bit tired of hexagonal translations where Go is concerned. 'Organic' as far as I'm concerned, is independent of the grid ('inspirited mechanisms' can emerge on any grid), but visually you may be right. On the other hand positions may become a bit blobby. I'm really not sure about it. 

Anyway, an applet isn't all that difficult to make, considering Ed just made a HexSymple applet:

For the record, Symple is a 'territory/connection' hybrid rather than a go/hex hybrid.
