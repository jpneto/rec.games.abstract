Yes, you're right. The Board Game Geek
database says that Milton Bradley published
the game under the name Domination instead
of Focus.

It seems to rate pretty highly on that site,
but I don't see any place to play it online
and no one seems to have written much about it.

I can't help you with your original question, but if you find any
articles yourself, be sure to send them my way.

A couple of months ago, a friend of mine and I played this just once,
not long after I purchased a used set on eBay.  I think we both felt it
was interesting, but the verdict, for us, is probably not out yet.  The
reason we played it just once was only because we were trying a bunch of
new games that afternoon.

In our game, my friend Adam seemed to have gain an edge early and was
able to convert it to a victory.  We both figured there is MUCH more to
than game than what we picked up in the one game we played.
