That's totally incorrect.  These two inequities compound each other.
There could be no game more skewed than an unequal goals connection
game without the pie rule, and that's exactly what bothers me about
unequal goals games.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It all depends on what the unequal goals are.  Here's an example:
Consider Craig Schensted's game of Star, leaving out the pie rule.
Star is an equal goals game in which the goal is to score more points
than your opponent.  The player who goes first has a significant
advantage without the pie rule.  On small boards, this advantage is
very big.  Now we can invent a variation on this game in which goals
are unequal, and which is more balanced than the equal-goals version:
instead of "the goal is to score more points than your opponent", we
can choose the rule:  "player 1 wins if he scores at least 2 more
points than his opponent, and player 2 wins otherwise."  The increased
difficulty for player 1 in achieving his goal compensates for the
advantages of his going first, and the result is a more balanced game.

when I read your announcement of a new game a few
posts back, about halfway through I realized that it was only a minor
variation of previous games, and it was deflating.

Heh. Originality wasn't one of the design goals of that game.
