This is a variant of Mark Steere's new game "Atoll".

Atoll is played on a board with internal hex-connections,
and globally square, divided into 8 equal(-ish) half-sides.

The winning criterion is almost identical to that of "Y",
except that the Y criterion is specifically adapted to
figures with an ODD number of sides, (Y has 3, but
variants with 5, 7 etc are simple).  Atoll, however,
is specifically adapted to boards with an EVEN number.

Mark is to be strongly congratulated on discovering
the natural criterion for even-sided boards!

However, having noticed that, it is perhaps most natural
to get away from Atoll's square-shaped board, and move
on to the new game, with its globally hex shape, being
a natural complement to its local hex connectivity.

Thus, I propose "HEXATOLL", which is essentially just
Atoll played on a hexagonal board.

Here is the board, with starting regions around the rim:

| 1               x x o o
| 2          o  .  .  .  .  . x
| 3        o  .  .  .  .  .  .  x
| 4       x  .  .  .  .  .  .  . o
| 5     x  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  . o
| 6       .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .
| 7     o  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  .  x
| 8       o  .  .   .  .  .  .  .  x
| 9         x  .  .   .  .  .  .  o
| 10         x  .   .  .  .  . o
| 11              o  o x x

(Apologies for the screwy ascii graphics.)
Obviously it can generalise to larger boards.

As before, each player must try to connect one of
his own rim regions with a directly opposite one.
As before, there would be a swap (PIE) rule.

As before, the game is win-loss complementary,
and iso-tasking.

Cheers!    Bill
