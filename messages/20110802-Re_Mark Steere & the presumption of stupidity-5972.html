Monkey Queen has a fabulous architecture, among my very best. The

We can't all be perfect, but how exactly did you discover the

Hi Christian,

My new "stacking" (?) game bears an obvious resemblance to your Monkey
Trap. As a tribute, I wanted to call it Monkey Queen. If you're not a
million percent comfortable with that name, I won't be the least bit
offended and it'll be a very simple matter for me to find a different
theme, or just not have a theme, which I usually don't have anyway.

May I also note that the only thing you need, apparently, to turn "an
uninspired, dime-a-dozen, ko dependent game" into a game with "a
fabulous architecture" is to add a rather artificial mobile drain
mechanism. Is that your whole definition of architecture?
