<br>Huh. I never heard of "game researchers" before. Except possibly folks like

<br>Thanks for the link. You might want to take a look at Games of No Chance
<br>by Richard J. Nowakowski. That's a starter. There's more theory in there on
<br>on combinatorial games than one could ever imagine. Also, there are several
<br>groups (not discussion groups though), that are studying games:

<br></blockquote>
<br>Well, it has as much "purpose" as any other theoretical research does, which
<br>a lot of people might argue is none at all. After all, it is theory. Some
<br>people are interested (believe it or not) in knowing which games are unsolvable
<br>by computers, and which aren't. Or upper bounds on the minimum # of moves it
<br>would take to kill and opponent in chess given your pieces remaining, etc.
<br>I'm particularly interested in how games can be classified and represented by
<br>computers. It's interesting to know that some games, (maybe only under given
<br>conditions) is equivalent to another game, etc.
<br>
<br>I suppose it's hard to answer that question... theory doesn't really apply
<br>itself so it's hard to tie a purpose to it. It's just fun to talk about, I
<br>guess :)
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Let's put it this way: I'd like a group called alt.games.theory or
<br></blockquote>
<br>alt.game.research.
<br>
<br>You have two choices: have these discussions in existing forums (like one
<br>for designers of games - and yes, perhaps players of games as well), or
<br>start your own forum.&nbsp; The process of making a newsgroup is not that easy,
<br>and nobody else is going to do that work for you.&nbsp; Why don't you go ahead
<br>and start your discussions now (I still recommend rec.games.design). Then
<br>once you've gotten a passionate enough group, then go ahead and start up the
<br>new forum.
<br></blockquote>
<br>That's exactly what I'm going to try to do. I don't expect anyone to do this
<br>for me, but I'm looking for my audience first.
