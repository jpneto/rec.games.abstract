   The thing is, in an unbelievable number of endgames,
the person who wins is the one who is able to sneak behind
his opponent's pawns with his King, so he can attack them from 
the rear (they can't move any faster than he can, so this is effective.)
  If you have to prevent the King from getting behind your pawns
in order to hold a drawn endgame, you obviously can't let him get
access to your back rank, which is also behind your pawns.  I'm afraid
that this quick-fix is really going to make almost no difference
whatsoever.  Sorry.

I disagree. If getting your king to the 8th rank before your opponent does the
same would win the game, most of the endgames you refer to would turn into a
king race. The pawns would lose their importance.
