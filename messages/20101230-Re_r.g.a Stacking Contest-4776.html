Hi again fizzy,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I like Stax, mostly.  I think it is more elegant than Hive and
promises sharp tactics, and possibly also good strategic depth based
on stack heights.  But I have two concerns.  Might it not prove very
difficult to win if an opponent concentrates on defense, keeping his
king high and working to keep adjacent stacks less accesible and
therefore short?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Maybe... maybe not. If this proved to be a problem I'd consider adding
the Ramping Up rule which stops pieces stepping down more than one
level at any step during a move.

This would mean that pieces at the top of pinnacle have limited
mobility as they could only move in the direction of adjacent
neighbours of height N-1. In most cases this would mean that they can
only move back in the direction they took to get up there. So a king
might escape to a pinnacle but find itself trapped there...

Regards,
Cameron
