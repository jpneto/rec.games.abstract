This may not be new, but I've not seen it before.

In brief:

Players place pieces of one colour onto a hex-hex board until one of
them instead declares that he can connect any two of them. At that
point the opponent adopts the opposite colour, and tries to stop that
connection happening through normal hex-like play.


More formally:

Overview
========
This is a connection game played on a hex-hex board. Players,
deferring to tournament director, must agree to a finite size in
advance. There are 2 colours for playing pieces to be placed on the
board, which I shall denote by the terms the "connector's" colour, and
the "separator's" colour. One player will have the role of connecting
pieces, the other, of keeping those pieces separate. A third colour of
piece, or a way of marking some of the pieces as special is useful,
but not compulsory.

The players take alternate turns. There are two phases to the game,
setting up, and playing out.

Setting Up
==========
For your turn, you may place a piece of the connector's colour
anywhere on the board.  Alternatively, you may declare "I will connect
two of those pieces", assume the role of the "connector", and the game
enters the second phase. If you have a way of marking the already-
placed pieces, such as replacing them with a third colour, do that now.

Playing Out
===========
The separator now plays a peice of his own colour, and as per most hex
variants, turns alternate with players placing pieces of their own colour.

Win/Loss Criteria
=================
If the connector manages to connect any two of the pieces placed before
his declaration, then he wins.
If the separator manages to build loops (as per havannah, say) isolating
(surrounding) at least all but one of the pieces placed before the 
opponent's declaration, then the separator wins.
If the board fills, and no declared connection has been made, the 
separator wins.
