That shit was hilarious.  That's why I don't talk to 19 year old women on
the Internet.  Just a19 year old willing to talk to me is highly suspicious.

What the fuck is wrong with Howe (Fizzy)?  First he rips Christian a new
asshole for some shit, I forget what.  Then he rips me a new asshole for
being "vulgar and insulting".  After years of holding court in
rec.games.abstract, now suddenly I'm vulgar and insulting.  Fast forward to
bgg where Howe is having a big tizzy over "References to male organ" and
other perceived anti-gay slurs.

Show of gay hands.  Does anyone care if Michael Howe is gay or not gay?
