Well, as Markus put it: 

"I´m affraid with the designers of the 13 finalist not voting, there will be only a few geeks caring about combinatorial games left."

Sadly funny :)

Sorry! mister Freeling.
You can not change the rules as you wish!!!???
Why my game Exasott published in 2012 was rejected and not another game published in 2012????????????????????
It is better than you cancel a contest than showing a big masquerade! 
No one is in hurry.
Ask how many people want to participate to the vote.
Give them the authorization to vote. If they are not busy they will vote. Anyway if you have 100 people willing to vote and only 90 are voting it is good. There is a credibility but if you have 20 people voting then cancel the ceremony.
