Yes, a programmer will spend a lot of time on that.  But this fact has
nothing to do with the claim "only-runs-on-Linux part, but I suppose that
can hardly be helped".  Is there something about linux that makes GUI
programming easier than on other platforms?

No, there's something about Windows that makes cross-platform
programming difficult.  Microsoft doesn't have any interest in making it
easy to write software that runs just as well on Windows and non-Windows
platforms.  And they have lots of ways to make it more difficult.  So,
when the developers are developing on Linux, it's quite hard for them to
write something that works well on Windows too.  So they usually don't.
