Does anyone have a FAQ or set of rules to 500 BID?  The reason I ask is that
I recently bought a card game rule book.  The rules for 500 BID in it where
somewhat different than what I have played.  For instance, there was no
'inkle' and the widow specified was three cards, while I've played with both
three and five card widows.  I always played that 7 was the minimum bid, while
in the book, they had a bids starting at 6.  I didn't see any optional rules
that would explain these discrepancies.  Anyone know if 'inkling' and five
card widows are optional rules or just things that people either intentionally
or mistakenly added?  Thanks.

Practically every card game that's evolved over time (which
I guess includes practically all card games) tend to have lots 
and lots of variants, which may be regional.  I swear every time
I look up a game in Hoyle, it's different in at least one
or two ways from the version I know.

In the case of 500 (I've always just called it "500" as 
opposed to "500 bid"), I originally learned to use inkling
and a 5-card widow from my parents.  We also use the
nello (spelling?) and double nello bids, but I've played 
with people who didn't.  I also originally learned to play
using a standard auction bid (like bridge), but then my
parents changed their story and started playing with 
only 1 bid per player (which I don't like nearly as much).

So I don't have any firm answers for you, but I would guess
that these are just all regional variations to the game...
