I recently bought a game called Celtic Chess, though I had read about
it under a different name: "tablut", where it was said to be a game

the northern part of Finland, I think). I have some problems with
understanding the rules, namely the rules for capture. Has anyone got
information?

White is dubbed as "the chieftain", black is "the attackers". The
warriors move like chess rooks. The chieftain moves the same way but
only one square until he has reached one of the edges of the board. He
may then move like a warrior, but only along the edge. No warrior may
stop on the corner square, they cannot stop on the the center square
but may pass through it.

The chieftain's goal is to reach one of the corners. The attackers'
goal is to capture the chief by circling him with 4 warriors
(horizontally &amp; vertically), or with 3 if the chieftain is along the
edge.

To capture a warrior, the opponent must put 2 warriors on the sides of
the former. If a warrior is aside a corner square, it counts as an
opposite warrior. What is imprecise with the rules is whether the 2
warriors should be at the opposite of the captured warrior (i.e. the
three form a line), or if the fact that any 2 warriors aside an
opponent suffice to capture the latter.

  Is this the first occurence of this set of rules?  I have seen several games,
both board and computer using the same rules.  The only difference being the
size of the board and the number of pieces on each side.  Well, the story
given is generally different too.  I can't believe that it is by sheer
coincidence that so many games can exist with this same set of rules.  So does
anyone know if this was the first game to use these rules, and if not, what is?
