Hello,
     I am trying to find out some information about Mancala style games.
I have heard several different names used for these games including
wari (awari?), kalah (kahala?), dakor and congklak.  I have seen
different descriptions of the rules for some of these games, but none
of them seem very complete.  I need to know the initial # of pebbles
for all of the holes (including the stores, I think its called), the
method for movement, variations, etc.
  
     Also, I made a trip to Kenya last Christmas.  While there I picked
up a board for a game called Ajua.  The board was made of two
boards hinged so the set could close on itself, presumably for
transport.  It differs radically from Mancala boards in that it has 32
holes in four rows, two rows to each half of the set.  Two of the holes
are square and somewhat larger than the rest, which are round.  The
board looks somewhat like this (O = round hole, S = square hole)

       O O O O O O O O
       O O O S O O O O
     -------------------  Hinge
       O O O O S O O O
       O O O O O O O O

The board came with a photocopy of a newspaper article describing how
much fun it was to play the game, but very little about how to play
the game.  Anyways, I lost the article.  In general it seems to be a
Mancala game, but the board does not fit.  Is it possible that there
is a very different game here, or maybe I got suckered into buying
a flawed Mancala board  :)  If anyone knows of specific rules for
Ajua, I would like to find out.  Thank you
