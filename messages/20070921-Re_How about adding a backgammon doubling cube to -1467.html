You'd be missing an interesting feature of backgammon, the gammon,
so that if you are winning too strongly you don't want to double.

Well, I was putting this out here as an addition to other strategy
games.  How would you add the gammon to the mix?  My idea is to try to
add another level to make abstract strategy games more interesting to
watch over television, like chess, by adding a play with the odds
factor to it.  How would you add a gammon to other games?  I am not
sure how you would pull this off personally.  Also you need a way to
deal with draws.  The idea wasn't to make other games more like
backgammon, but borrow something from another game (backgammon) and
see if it addresses the issues  of the likes of chess.

Here is another situation approach off this original idea (inspired a
bit by poker):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Inverse variant (based around poker):
1. Players start with a fix number of points (player uses chips to
track).  Each player starts off by offering to risk 2 points.
2. Player can pick however many points to risk (like chips in poker).
Player then can raise the amount, call or fold.  If player folds then
that player loses his or her points he risk.  Other player keeps their
points.  Keep track of the last amount of chips that were offered into
the game.
3. If player doesn't fold, then the bet marker goes to the player
being challenged.  That player has an option to raise on an opponent.
4. If either player wins the game, then the losing player in the full
amount.  If the player to do raise last happens to lose or draw, he
puts his full amount of money.  The other player(s) in the game, will
only lose to last level bet if they draw, or none if they won.
Example:  If a prior bet level was set at 6, and then raised to 10, on
the case of a draw, all other player(s) in the game would end up
losing 6, while the person who bet last would lose 10.
5. Players can only wager as many points as they have and no more than
the player who has the least amount of points in the game at the time.
6. If keeping scoring for match, the player's final score is equal to
the number of points they had.
