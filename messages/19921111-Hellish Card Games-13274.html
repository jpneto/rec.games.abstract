Okay, Maybe this doesn't belong here, but here's a try:

This is a card game called variously mao, mau, or quasi-mao (a REALLY
nasty variant thought up by a friend of mine)... I'm sure it's played
all over the place but I learned it at the American Regions Math League
meet a few years ago.

Best with five players.  The following rules are 'basic rules':

1  Each player takes a turn in rotation to the left.
2  The dealer deals seven cards to each player, eight to himself and
then selects one to be the first card played.
3  A turn consists of playing one card or drawing one card from the pile
of unused cards.
4  When the pile is exhausted it is shuffled (some variants have "mercy"
rules that state that all players with more than twenty cards discard all
but twenty of them) and play begins again with the top three cards from the
old discard pile.
5  Rules may require players to play certain cards or do certain things
based on the last three cards played and who played them.  No rule may reach
more than three cards back.
6  (oops)  To play a card it is laid on the last card played.  No one may
look through the pile of played cards.
7  The winner of a hand is the first player to play his last card and say
"Mau" (or whatever the name of the game is).  A player going out but failing
to say "Mau" commits a foul.
8  A player violating any rule commits a foul and is penalized by drawing
a card.  A player falsely accusing another of committing a foul himself
commits a foul.
9  A player taking more than fifteen seconds for his turn commits a foul.
10 When two people have won hands, the two of them confer and create a new
mutable rule which is not initially known to the other players.  This rule
may require players to do or play anything (within reason as determined
by your player group...)  This occurs after every second hand, or less
often if one player wins consecutive hands.

Then there is a first rule, which is (highly) mutable:

1  A legal play consists of playing a card which is either of the same suit
or the same rank as the last card played.

Only mutable rules may be changed by other mutable rules.  If a lower-numbered
rule is not SPECIFICALLY changed or repealed by a higher-numbered rule, then
the lower rule takes precedence.  (Rule numbers must go in sequence...)

The "quasi-mao" variant I mentioned now has a total of twenty-one mutable
rules.  It's really hellish especially since I don't know but about six of 
them.  And there's no mercy rule.  (I prefer to play with a 20- or 25-card
mercy rule, but others are nastier.)
