It's a subjective matter as to whether or not a class of games

Which would seem to be a difference between you and everyone else in the
thread. I personally consider a generalization of a game to be a class
of games defined by some rules (for example, the constraints on possible
boards in Atoll) that keeps some properties of that game.

I've had to backpedal a tad here.  Instead of insisting that Mind
Ninja can't possibly be considered a generalization of Hex I've taken
the softer stance that to me it seems absurd to call a game that
shares half of one property of Hex a generalization of Hex.  And if MN
is a generalization of Hex then Whopper is a generalization of Chess.
The word "generalized" can itself be so generalized as to have
virtually no meaning, which has been the whole thrust of the counter-
argument here.

Now, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>would<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
consider some generalizations to be more interesting than others (i.e.,
they keep more of the interesting properties of the original game
intact), and in that sense, Atoll looks to be the most interesting
generalization of Hex that currently exists (with the caveat that I
don't know much of what is out there).

Thank you.  There doesn't seem to be a whole heck of a lot out there
in this specific class of games.  Not that I have an encyclopedic
knowledge of connection games - far from it.  But I'm relying on those
who do.
