I think that's exactly what you did.  Your claim that Ecalper has a
particularly large game tree for a given board size is a very
provocative invitation for comparison with other games played on the
same size board having possibly an even larger game tree.

I did it just
for explaining Ecalper is a deep game, also with just 127 stones.

....compounding your chicanery.  A big game tree doesn't guarantee a
deep game.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The reason why it has a so big game-tree complexity is because Ecalper
is (more or less) a three-move game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Wrong and completely irrelevant.  One move per turn, three moves per
turn, 63 moves per turn...  Moves per turn translates to jack squat.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
How many possible moves in Oust does the player have in the second
turn? I think it's 120. In Ecalper, however, during the second turn
player has 930372 possible moves to choose from.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Mathematically absurd.  By partitioning the total number of turns into
n-move stone placements you reduce the total number of turns by a
factor of n.  It's like we both have 127 Gummi bears and you, after
partitioning yours into 42 bags of 3, claim to have an astronomical
number of Gummi bears.

This, to me, is a strong clue Ecalper has a bigger game-tree
complexity than Outs (with a fair and meaningful number of turns).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

"Fair and meaningful" has nothing to do with the overall game tree
size.  It's just a subjective way to prune the tree.

There's a huge amount of tree-shrinking redundancy in Ecalper.  If
you're putting three black stones on cells x, y, and z, does it matter
if you instead place them in the order y, z, x?  No, it doesn't.  All
that tree-expanding freedom of movement has a tree-shrinking
redundancy counterpart.
