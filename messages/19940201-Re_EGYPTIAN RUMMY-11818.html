 &gt;Anyone know the ruled to this card game?

 &gt;a number of rules that made it more strategic and complex.

 &gt;If you can help me out I'd appreciate it.

  The game you are referring to I've played as Egyptian Ratscrew, which is
 indeed a sort of combination of Slapjack and War. The gist is -- you
 divide the deck into two stacks (as in War), giving one to each player.
 The game is played by each player taking turns flipping over their top
 cards, one after the other -- not simultaneously like War. 
  To begin, one person flips over their top card. If this card is anything
 but a face card (A,K,Q,J) nothing happens, and the other player flips over
 their top card. If it is a face card, the other player is faced with the 
 challenge of likewise flipping a facecard or losing all the cards 
 involved thus far. He/she has a varying amount of opportunity to do 
 this, as well. If the card was an Ace, he/she has 4 chances (flips) to 
 counter with another face card (any one, it doesn't have to be the same); 
 if it was a King, 3 chances; Queen, 2; and if it was a Jack, there is but 
 1 chance to avoid losing cards. If no facecard is turned over, the 
 original player takes all the cards in the "played" stack (like winning a 
 battle in War).[Note of course that if the player successfully flips over 
 another face card, the onus is now upon the original player to 
 successfully defend the "new" challenge!]
  If at any time two cards of the same # (i.e. 2-Ace) are flipped over 
 consecutively, the first person to slap the deck gets all the cards 
 therein (a la Slapjack). This is true even if the cards were played 
 during a "facecard-induced challenge", so keep your eyes on the discards 
 at all times!!!
  As in War, you replay the cards you win as your unflipped cards are 
 used, and also as in War the game ends when one person has all the cards.
 
  Many thanks to Lauren Bienstock, who showed me this game years ago.
