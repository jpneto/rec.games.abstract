Depends on what you mean by "about even".

Hex.  Since draws are impossible, every position is an advantage for
one side or the other.  If you play hex on a small enough board, then
this becomes obvious---it's impossible to equalize 4x4 hex to be an
"about even" game for experienced players.

In games where there are few moves, it would also be impossible to
equalize (in the extreme, if the game only has two moves by the first
player and one by the second, then three-move equalization becomes
obviously silly).  But offhand, I can't think of any interesting games
which usually have less than a dozen moves... unless you think of
tic-tac-toe as an interesting game :-).

Heavens yes!  I've been grouching about this for years.  So has
everyone else with a bit of game-theoretic sense, of course.  But have
you ever tried talking to a chess expert aboput this?  Cripes; talk
about wild-eyed paranoia!  You'll get the most amazing spiel of
nonsense arguments about it. It's the same in any game, seemingly; the
expert doesn't want his pet cabbage patch messed up!

While I tend to agree with you about stalemate, YOUR wild-eyed,
spittle-flying rant against stalemate forces me to play devil's
advocate :-).

For chess, I think a good (i.e., sensible) argument for stalemate is
that it makes end-game theory more interesting---which has implications
throughout the entire game.

And there is a natural explanation for the stalemate rule:  Clocks are
a relatively recent addition to the game.  Without a clock, a player in
stalemate simply doesn't (can't) move, and never loses.  One of the
historical reasons for adding clocks to chess is that players who were
losing sometimes started "thinking" for outragous lengths of time...

To note the opposite bias about the game:  End-game theory tends to
only be a major issue for strong chess players.  Amateurs rarely
reach the end-game, so the stalemate rule seems pointless.

I used to agree with you that stalemate was a silly rule.  But as my
chess skill improves, and I begin to occassionally reach endgame
positions (not often---I'm certainly still an amateur :-)), it makes
more sense.

Fundamentally, chess is not a game for those who want "elegant" rules.
Too many different types of pieces, too many exceptions to movement
rules (pawns!).  For elegance, I recomment Go with chinese rules.
