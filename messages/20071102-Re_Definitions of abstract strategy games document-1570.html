Now I've learned that there is some degree of consensus that abstract
games may be "lightly themed."  People who play lightly themed games
will tell you that the light theme has absolutely no bearing on the
gameplay and that such games are "essentially" abstract.  Still, I
have some difficulty letting go of my view of abstract games being
themeless, Reversi, Go, and Checkers being good examples.

I wrote two follow-ups to Mark's contribution and accidentally posted
the wrong one. I won't bother to replace it, as the correct one said
much the same thing only a bit more briefly and less pompously. I'm
useless at newsgroups. They go much too fast for a slow thinker like me.

No problem.  You do what you can.  Point here is to stimulate
sufficient debate that conclusions can get reached.  I will comment
here that I believe Chess960 is perfectly acceptable as an abstract
strategy game IF players play duplicate positions both black and white
during a match (in other words both sides are played twice).  The
issue of randomness in this case is that it is fair to all players
involved.  If you happen to go with a version of Chess960 where
players end up alternating putting their pieces on the board before
they start, and players get to see where they put their pieces and
respond, that counts.  It fits along the lines of a positioning game.

Of course there is games like kriegspiel and backgammon, that have
their own issues.  Kriegspiel seems just plain odd that it wouldn't be
included.  And backgammon is sufficiently popular, and requires
sufficient strategy, that to say it is forbidden to be included, would
be odd (it is currently placed under the Fortuna category).  The key
to randomness is that it is fair to all players, during a match.  This
would mean that there is deterministic outcome from what player does
during their turn, and things balance out over the whole.

Anyhow, I am proposing another category for abstract game playing,
that isn't a category for games, but for tournaments.  It is the
Athlon:
6. Athlon (Tournament): This is another unique category. It does refer
to specific types of games but types of multiple games (each of
different types) tournaments IAGO would sponsor. It is included to
discuss the parameters of what kind of tournaments that have IAGO
involvement.
* Standard: All the games in Standard Athlon tournaments involve no
games that aren't officially recognized for tournament play in IAGO.
Hybrid (see below) covers cases of where at least one of the games
isn't an officially recognized abstract strategy game for tournament
play. An Athlon tournament involving chess, go and backgammon would be
considered a Standard Athlon tournament.
* Hybrid: For a game to be a Hybrid Athlon tournament, a minimum of
50% of the games involved in the tournament structure must be
officially IAGO recognized abstract strategy games for tournament
play. If this is the case, then a tournament involving these games
would be a Hybrid Athlon tournament. For example, a tournament
involving just chess, poker and bridge would not be consider a Hybrid
Athlon tournament. However, if the tournament consisted of chess,
backgammon and poker, it would be a Hybrid Athlon tournament.


IAGO could sponsor a tournament that had poker in it, under the Hybrid
version, if at least 50% of the other games are recognized games by
IAGO.  Under how I have argued for backgammon, then if backgammon is
recognized as an IAGO abstract strategy game, a poker-backgammon
Biathlon tournament would be acceptable.
