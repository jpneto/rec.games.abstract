1. Voting Instructions:

  In order to vote for or against this newsgroup, you must send a MAIL
message to the address:

 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu">mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu</a>

Posted votes will not be counted.
Votes mailed to the poster of this message will not be counted.


   Your mail should contain one of the following three lines, in the
BODY of the mail message:

    vote rec.games.miniatures yes
    vote rec.games.miniatures no
    vote rec.games.miniatures abstain

The first two lines register a vote either for or against the creation
of the newsgroup.  The third line cancels any previous vote for or
against the creation of the newsgroup.  Multiple voting messages from
the same person must be sent from the same address.  If multiple votes
are received from the same person, the last vote received is the only
one counted.

The subject line of your mail will be ignored.

  You should receive a response to your vote, acknowledging its
receipt, within two days.

2. Mail problems.

If you do not receive a response to your vote or if you have some other
problem with voting, you can get help by sending mail to

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:postmaster@pit-manager.mit.edu">postmaster@pit-manager.mit.edu</a>.

If your site does not understand that address, you might try:

    <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:mail-server%pit-manager.mit.edu@athena.mit.edu">mail-server%pit-manager.mit.edu@athena.mit.edu</a>
    mit-athena!pit-manager.mit.edu!mail-server
    uunet!pit-manager.mit.edu!mail-server

If none of these addresses works, talk to someone at your site who can
help you address the mail properly.  


3. Call for vote procedure

The Vote

1) AFTER the discussion period, if it has been determined that a new group is
   really desired, a name and charter are agreed upon, and it has been
   determined whether the group will be moderated and if so who will
   moderate it, a call for votes may be posted to news.announce.newgroups and
   any other groups or mailing lists that the original request for discussion
   might have been posted to. There should be minimal delay between the
   end of the discussion period and the issuing of a call for votes.
   The call for votes should include clear instructions for how to cast
   a vote. It must be as clearly explained and as easy to do to cast a
   vote for creation as against it, and vice versa.  It is explicitly
   permitted to set up two separate addresses to mail yes and no votes
   to provided that they are on the same machine, to set up an address
   different than that the article was posted from to mail votes to, or
   to just accept replies to the call for votes article, as long as it
   is clearly and explicitly stated in the call for votes article how
   to cast a vote.  If two addresses are used for a vote, the reply
   address must process and accept both yes and no votes OR reject
   them both.

2) The voting period should last for at least 21 days and no more than 31
   days, no matter what the preliminary results of the vote are. The exact
   date that the voting period will end should be stated in the call for
   votes. Only votes that arrive on the vote-taker's machine prior to this
   date will be counted.

3) A couple of repeats of the call for votes may be posted during the vote, 
   provided that they contain similar clear, unbiased instructions for
   casting a vote as the original, and provided that it is really a repeat
   of the call for votes on the SAME proposal (see #5 below). Partial vote
   results should NOT be included; only a statement of the specific new
   group proposal, that a vote is in progress on it, and how to cast a vote.
   It is permitted to post a "mass acknowledgement" in which all the names
   of those from whom votes have been received are posted, as long as no
   indication is made of which way anybody voted until the voting period
   is officially over.

4) ONLY votes MAILED to the vote-taker will count. Votes posted to the net
   for any reason (including inability to get mail to the vote-taker) and 
   proxy votes (such as having a mailing list maintainer claim a vote for 
   each member of the list) will not be counted.

5) Votes may not be transferred to other, similar proposals. A vote shall
   count only for the EXACT proposal that it is a response to. In particular,
   a vote for or against a newsgroup under one name shall NOT be counted as
   a vote for or against a newsgroup with a different name or charter,
   a different moderated/unmoderated status or (if moderated) a different
   moderator or set of moderators.

6) Votes MUST be explicit; they should be of the form "I vote for the
   group foo.bar as proposed" or "I vote against the group foo.bar
   as proposed". The wording doesn't have to be exact, it just needs to
   be unambiguous. In particular, statements of the form "I would vote
   for this group if..." should be considered comments only and not
   counted as votes.

7) A vote should be run only for a single group proposal.  Attempts to create
   multiple groups should be handled by running multiple parallel votes rather
   than one vote to create all of the groups.

The Result

1) At the completion of the voting period, the vote taker must post the
   vote tally and the E-mail addresses and (if available) names of the voters
   received to news.announce.newgroups and any other groups or mailing lists
   to which the original call for votes was posted. The tally should include
   a statement of which way each voter voted so that the results can be
   verified.

2) AFTER the vote result is posted, there will be a 5 day waiting period,
   beginning when the voting results actually appear in 
   news.announce.newgroups, during which the net will have a chance to
   correct any errors in the voter list or the voting procedure.

3) AFTER the waiting period, and if there were no serious objections that might
   invalidate the vote, and if 100 more valid YES/create votes are received
   than NO/don't create AND at least 2/3 of the total number of valid votes
   received are in favor of creation, a newgroup control message may be sent 
   out.  If the 100 vote margin or 2/3 percentage is not met, the group should 
   not be created.

4) The newgroup message will be sent by the news.announce.newgroups moderator
   at the end of the waiting period of a successful vote.  If the new group is
   moderated, the vote-taker should send a message during the waiting period to
   Gene Spafford <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:spaf@cs.purdue.edu">&lt;spaf@cs.purdue.edu&gt;</a> and David C. Lawrence <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:tale@uunet.uu.net">&lt;tale@uunet.uu.net&gt;</a> with
   both the moderator's contact address and the group's submission address.

5) A proposal which has failed under point (3) above should not again be
   brought up for discussion until at least six months have passed from the
   close of the vote.  This limitation does not apply to proposals which never
   went to vote.

4. Precis of group proposal.

PURPOSE

  The newsgroup "rec.games.miniatures" would be a forum for discussing
  the all aspects of the hobby of tabletop miniature wargaming of all
  periods, from figure painting, terrain construction, historical information
  and army and unit composition through to rulesets, tabletop tactics,
  scenarios, campaigning and competitions.

  A "rec.games.miniatures" newsgroup would provide its readers an opportunity
  to discuss their experiences with other hobbyists, sharing skills, ideas,
  information and techniques on topics discussed.

  One major aim of the group is to provide a focus for hobbyists on the net
  to gain assistance from others in finding solutions to specific
  problems, e.g. locating information and sources for a topic or range
  of figures, rules or terrain materials or providing information on a
  new period a player wishes to try out.

and genres.      The periods concerned are too many to enumnerate here.
