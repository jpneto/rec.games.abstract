The original version of Pentominoes has been proven to be a first-player
win.  I heard a talk about this a few months ago from Hilarie Orman
(<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ho@cs.arizona.edu">ho@cs.arizona.edu</a>,) who proved the result.  Here's the abstract of
her talk.  I think the analysis required looking at ~10^8 positions.

----------------abstract follows------------------
The game of pentominoes uses 12 pieces of 5 squares each (the
pentominoes) and an 8x8 board.  Players alternate play by placing a piece
without overlap (rotating or flipping as desired) onto the board.  The
last player to place a piece wins.  That this game is a win for the
first player has been shown by exhaustive examination of the game tree
for a particular first move, one of two that were analyzed.  The
search was greatly facilitated by using DEC Alpha workstations with
64-bit word sizes; however, much of the work was done by using up to
32 nodes of an Intel Paragon with a 32-bit word size.

Some aspects of the game tree will be discussed, showing that
hypotheses about the number of winning moves and a winning strategy
(bifurcating the board) are refuted.  Three variants of the search
strategy were examined.  The most efficient strategy, which considered
placement before shape, was better than one which preferred moves near
the center of the board.  A third strategy, which considered shape
before placement, was much worse than the other two.
