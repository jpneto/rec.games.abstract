What a relief to see Corey Clark psychotically obsessed with someone

Glad to take the heat off you for a while.

lol thanks.  I wish I could say there's nothing to worry about from
Corey Clark, but if that were true, why am I looking over my shoulder
and not answering unrecognized phone numbers?  In all seriousness, I
really am relieved.  Clark's (hopefully temporary) psychotic obsession
with you just makes it a lot less likely that he's living in my
crawlspace.

But now I have reservations about showing up on igcc.

Clark does seem to have taken up residence at IGGC.  That's where I
first encountered him.  But that's not a reason to avoid IGGC, at
least not for me.  Corey Clark did stalk me at IGGC by relentlessly
joining all of my challenges, but if he does that, just mention it to
Arty.

Clark actually did sit down at one of my challenges after Arty talked
to him.  He was muttering something about how I ignored his request to
join that particular game.  I had told him the day before in Arty's
presence, and countless times before that, that I would never play any
game with him again - ever.  I had to explain to the psychopath that
"ever" included that day.  When I asked him to leave the game he
jumped up like his pants were on fire.  He's terrified to death of
Arty.

On a different note, I love all the programmers and their game sites,
especially Aaron, Arty, Bram, etc. etc. etc.  They've all done
inestimable good in helping promote my games over the years.  But in
the long run, and abstract game design is a very long term investment,
I don't strictly need them.  Mark Steere Games is chiseled in
granite.  Deep chiseled in hard granite, high in the mountains.  Game
sites, in stark contrast, are etched in wet sand on the beach, at low
tide.
