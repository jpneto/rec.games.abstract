 &gt;&gt; Isn't it possible to prove, in a more general way, that playing to the

 &gt;&gt; It cannot be a draw, and having the first move cannot be a disadvantage
 &gt;&gt; for the first player (since the game is monotonically increasing), so
 &gt;&gt; it is a win.  All that needs to be shown is that playing to the center
 &gt;&gt; hex is at least as good as any other move, which seems obvious, at
 &gt;&gt; least intuitively.
 
 &gt;What you have just argued is that the center move seems intuitively
 &gt;likely to win.  Everyone understands that.  The difference between that
 &gt;and a proof is rather vast.  The lacuna is that little matter of
 &gt;"playing to the center hex is at least as good...."

Well of course good intuition does not constitute a proof -- but I never
claimed the above argument was a proof sketch.  What it does suggest is
that such a proof may be feasible, unlike your Go example.
 
 &gt;It's like looking for a proof that moving first is an advantage in go.
 &gt;That is obviously true, and from experience we can even quantify the
 &gt;advantage fairly precisely.  But a proof is not only not forthcoming, it
 &gt;is so far beyond what we know how to prove as to be completely
 &gt;inaccessible.
 
It's not like that at all!  Go is non-monotonic.  Stones can be added or
subtracted.  Making a certain move may be worse than not making a move at
all.  In fact, making <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> move may be worse than passing (in the case of
seki, for example).

Trying to formally prove that the first move in Go is worth, say, seven
points appears to be prohibitively difficult, now or in the future.
Showing that Black can always win with a half-point komi (to eliminate the
possibility of a game-theoretic draw) would be much easier -- compare it
to the proof that the first player in Hex has a win.  (It may be necessary
to add a proviso or prove that best play does not lead to one grand seki,
in order to avoid the possibility of zugzwang).

There are many things about Hex that can be proven, despite it's inherent
complexity.  Generalized Hex was the first example of a PSPACE-hard (and,
in fact, PSPACE-complete) problem.  Does that mean that all things about
the general game are unknowable?  Absolutely not!

We know that the first player has a win, regardless of the (regular)
size of the Hex board.  Showing that the center hex is one such winning
move need not be difficult at all.  Showing that an arbitrary hex is
winning (or losing) must be prohibitively difficult (unless the hierarchy
of complexity classes collapses [P=NP]).

Hex is monotonic, by which I mean that making <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> move is at least as
good as passing, and stones are never removed from the board.  As such,
it is possible, in principle, to measure the value of each move with an
admissible evaluation heuristic.  This heuristic may be quite weak, and
totally unable to distinguish a winning move from a losing move.  But as
long as it is able to say that move A is no weaker than move B, in terms
of game theoretic value, we are done.  I claim that applying such a
heuristic to all of the initial hexes would show that the center hex is
at least as strong as any other hex on the board.  This (possibly weak)
statement, combined with the well-known existential proof, is sufficient
to show that the center hex is a winning move.

The hard part, of course, is to come up with an admissible function.  
For Go, with stones being added and removed, I would immediately throw my
hands up in despair.  With Hex, we need not be so pessimistic.  I don't
know enough about the game to make any informed suggestions, but the idea
that such a function is possible should not be dismissed without good
reason.

It is possible to identify and at least partially quantify certain relevant
relationships between hexes, in terms of connectivity, independent sets,
branching of variations, and so on.  This is what humans do when they play
the game, and what computer programs use in the form of common heuristics.
Can you offer a single reason why the discovery of an admissible function
for an empty board should be impossible?
