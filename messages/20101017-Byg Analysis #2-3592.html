Reposted from blog: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nickbentley.posterous.com/byg-analysis-2">http://nickbentley.posterous.com/byg-analysis-2</a>

In my last post I pined for more game-analysis, and mere hours later
Benedikt Rosenau posted an analysis of Symplex and subsidiarily (not a
word) of Byg.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/574830/byg-preview-of-symplex">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/574830/byg-preview-of-symplex</a>

Now I'm excited and will record some thoughts inspired by Benedikt's
post.

First, he says that a one-stone pie rule may not be enough to balance
either game.  The given reason is that the first-mover can force an
advantage by waiting to grow until just after his opponent does, and
thereby have an extra group to grow through much of the game.  So
there's no balanced first move and you should always swap the pie.

My experience with Byg is consistent with the claim (although I'm
uncertain because in this early stage of understanding, new insights
can change things.  For example, because it's sometimes better to
avoid connecting, extra stones might be turned into a liability. This
may apply especially for small boards, which get cramped quickly)

Benedikt suggests that a 3-stone pie rule might solve the problem.
I've grown wary of multi-stone pie rules, because a) they confuse new
players; and b) they allow player 1 to study and then use a particular
opening set-up, giving him an informational advantage over player 2.

Groping for another solution, I had an idea which I hope will resolve
not only the pie-rule issue (if it exists), but also a problem Harald
Korneliussen raised in a comment to another post.  He says that:

"...the game has the minor problem that you need to keep track of
which pieces you placed in this turn, and there could get quite a lot
of them." (this applies both to Byg and Symplex.)

I agree.  We've been playing Byg on a small board on which neither
player usually has more than 5 groups, and then only briefly.  More
than that would feel clunky to me (Benedikt alludes to having 9-11
groups on his larger boards while playing Symplex).

My proposal: a hard limit on the number of groups you can grow. For
example, even if you have 9 groups on the board, you may grow no more
than 4 (we should test to find the best number).

It solves Harald's concern about too many moves, and it may also solve
Benedikt's problem, because the first-mover can no longer ensure that
he grows one more group than his opponent.  It's worth testing
anyway.

Thinking about Benedikt's balance issue has me reconsidering an
earlier thought.  I suggested that Byg might benefit by making group-
growth more powerful, so that it happens earlier.  This I now see I
might be wrong.  If group-growth is more powerful than group creation,
then a person who sets up more future group-growth may have an
advantage over someone who chooses moderate group growth now.

If so, then maybe it's best to wait as long as possible before
starting group-growth.  If so, I don't like it because the the game is
most fun after group-growth begins.

Therefore, perhaps it would be best to make group-growth weak, as
would a hard limit on the number of groups you may grow.  I don't
understand the game well enough to know whether this idea is right.

Curiously, Benedikt says that in most of his games of Symplex, the
outcome would have been the same as if he had been playing Byg.  It
caught my eye because I've seen the opposite: of the 16 Byg matches
I've recorded, 10 of them would have given the opposite outcome if
we'd been playing Symplex.

The reason is that, when playing Byg, the eventual winner often
ensures that his opponent can't connect some of his groups.  As a
result, the opponent ends up growing more groups throughout the
endgame and ending up with so many more stones on the board that his
Symplex-score would be sky-high.

Maybe this dynamic doesn't occur during Symplex, and that's why our
experiences differ?
