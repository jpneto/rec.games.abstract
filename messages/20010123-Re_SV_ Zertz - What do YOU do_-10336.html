I don't mean this in a mean spirited way, but after reading your post
Justin all I could think about was someone saying something like...

It did?  I just wanted to know, from people who are much more experienced
than my wife and I are, whether the early stategies we were trying were on
the right track.  I thought it was clear that I didn't understand the game
much in the least! My questions were more like, "It seems like it's easier
for a left-handed hitter to hit against a right-handed pitcher...is this
true?"

I've already found out that:

a)  Isolations indeed should happen more often than they do in our games.
b)  The first person really should not have an disadvantage.  
c)  Perhaps one white marble is a good start, but it probably isn't a good
second or third move.  (Opening stategies seem the most opaque to us, so
I'm glad we now have something to start off on.)

I expected and hoped for answers like this, and that's what I got (but I
want more!).  Maybe it's the title of the thread that got your goat.  How
would YOU start a discussion on Zertz strategy?  Believe me, if I just
asked, "What's good Zertz strategy?", I'd get nothing...very
disheartening.

Anyway, back onto the subject.  I've only played a handful of times, and
I'm impressed how early in the game I've started planning things out.
At first, I played the first 4 or so marbles in a random sort of way.
Now, I'm trying to set things up from the start.

This is just the sort of comment I was fishing for.  Can you start
"setting things up" from the second marble?  From the first?  For us,
sacrifices usually occur when three marbles are on the board (which
possibly explains why the first person loses a lot in our games).  It
looks like we need to learn how to either:

a) make a nice move with 2 marbles on the board 
b) be able to form a 3 marble configuration that isn't a good "set up" for
the next player

A very nice game.

Agreed!  And a very rich game (as far as I can tell so far)...which is why
I brought up the subject!
