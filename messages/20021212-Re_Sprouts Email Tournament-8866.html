UT (1) has the value {*2|*2}, which is equal to 0.  This means that,
with competent play, it might as well not exist.  But if you can't
evaluate the position and you think that your opponent may be able to,
it is a good idea to avoid moving in a UT (1), as it increases your
opponent's options.

A simpler and more accurate statement would be, "It's always wrong to
move there," rather than, "It might as well not exist."  It does, after
all, provide a losing option in some winning positions.

As I mentioned to Nick, there are two types of UTs.  The "type 2" UT
includes a 1-liberty spot which communicates with a spot or spots that
are not part of the UT.  A move from the 1-liberty spot to one the
other two spots that make up the UT can actually be a good move, even
the only good move.  I've been calling that move "crashing" the trap.

Moving to a type 1 UT, on the other hand, is never necessary in a
winning position.  For that reason, we might call such a move "wrong"
from a practical standpoint.  But such a move does not necessarily
screw up a winning position either, so a lawyer might take exception
to your calling your statement "more accurate" even in the case of
type 1 UTs.
