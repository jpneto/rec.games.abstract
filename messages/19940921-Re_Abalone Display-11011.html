Why not just use the NAFA notation?  I personally don't have a copy, but 
I know I've heard others on this newsgroup talking about them.  They go 
something like this:

The rows are lettered A-I from "bottom" to "top" (just the opposite of yours)

The # of spaces from the "left" side of the board are 1 through however 
many spaces across the row lasts  (row D, for example, would be 1-8)

To denote a move, you state the string of marbles you are going to move 
(the beginning position and the end position) and the coordinate to which 
you are going to move the group to.  It may sound confusing, but think 
about it for awhile, try it out, and you'll see it really works.

Hope this is some help.  Any questions, just post 'em.
