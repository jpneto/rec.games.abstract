Just kidding  lol

People are complaining that I'm using this group as my own whatever.
I am obviously not an owner or a moderator of this group.  Anybody is
free to say anything they want here.

Do I verbally assault people?  Yes I do.  Ant bullies who couldn't cut
it in math and come to rec.games.abstract to heckle the designers,
thereby disrespecting the art, will be met with sharp ant incisors.

Snots who purport to own the group because they designed one or two
interesting games last millennium are also flesh tearing candidates.
Zeros who suck the snots' asses are also disfavored.

Oh, I almost forgot Nim variants.  If I don't take a stand against Nim
variants, who will?

What's left after all that?  Me, Leroy Quet, a handful of true
abstract fans, and the mopers -  grumpy old men who stop in to make a
mopey little comment once a month or so.  Any more often than that
might give the appearance of being interested.
