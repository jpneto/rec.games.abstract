Hi folks,

At least one of you said he wanted to read this, so here goes:

This text is about an example for what I call a declarative game. The game is
called PARTY-ANIMAL and does not exist in any form other than in my mind and in
yours when you're done reading this.
The game does not fulfill every single condition I would want to be taken up
by a truly declarative game, but it is only supposed to be a good-enough first
try. Also, please take into account that this specification is far from being
a formal description easily implementable. However, I don't think that it would
be difficult to implement P-A in, say, Prolog, although it sure would be a lot
of tedious work.

                             PARTY-ANIMAL

Party-Animal (henceforth referred to as P-A) is a game suitable for... let's
say 17 players. (For all I care it COULD be run with 174 players, too)
The players can be users connected with each other and with the
MasterControlProgram (MCP) over a computer-net (e.g. like UseNet) or they
can be participants in a PBM-game with the MCP being a commercial or
non-commercial PBM-company. Finally there is a version of P-A imaginable,
where 16 of the players and the MCP are run by a computer and only the 17th
player would be human, thus the game could be sold as a regular computer game.
The MCP, btw, is needed to resolute player actions and generally conduct play,
but it doesn't necessarily have to be a machine. In fact if someone is willing
to put in a tremendous kind of effort, he may hand-moderate P-A.

The idea:
Each player is a fervent party-goer and the goal of the game is to become a
P-A, i.e. someone who - amongst other things - is:
1.) invited to all the cool parties and not invited to the uncool ones, because
uncool parties are thrown by uncool people and they wouldn't dare ask a P-A
to come.
2.) never at a loss for the right thing to say when small-talking.
3.) always the focal point of a party, never standing around by himself.
4.) sucked up to by all uncool people.
5.) generally one of the major VIPs in town.
6.) the winner of the game, reaping whatever benefits there are to be reaped
from winning a game.
Apart from the 17 players there are also lots of other guests at the party,
whose behavior is not necessarily known to the players. Each party a different
set of 'other' guests is generated more or less randomly, along with some
regulars like the mayor.

The start-up situation:
Every player belongs to a social group, like yuppies, punks, hunks, athletes,
cheerleaders, joe_averages, nerds, brainies, rockers, freaks, high-society and
so on. His social group determines what kinds of abilities he has, e.g.:
A brainy can always talk to sophisticated people, whereas a cheerleader cannot.
A cheerleader on the other hand is well-liked by everyone on looks alone,
whereas nobody will remember a brainy the day after the party.

Social group also determines the strategic party movement of a player:
A yuppie will not go closer than 15 feet to a punk even if that means not
getting to talk to the mayor. A nerd will always have one eye at the buffet
to be the first one, when it opens, so he will not go further than 20 feet
from it. A cheerleader will always be on the look-out for any of her friends
to go to the bathroom in order to follow her to catch all the newest gossip.
A rocker will hang around the band, the high-society people will only
associate with themselves and so on. Think of all the prejudices you have and
bingo! Strategic party movement actually is a very important part of the game,
because you can:
1.) block out other people, who won't go near you, from an interesting
conversation.
2.) bribe others with the last bowl of caviar you were able to secure, because
you hung around the buffet all the time.
3.) determine the kind of music played by the band, when you stick around there
and bribe them with alcoholic beverages.
4.) generally get to interesting points of the party, if you are able to move
about pretty well.

Every player also knows several other party-goers, you can always break into a
conversation, if you know one of the small-talkers (other hinderances like
yuppie &lt;-&gt; punk notwithstanding). Talking to someone you don't know is only
possible if someone else introduced you before. However, once you have broken
into a certain social group, it becomes much easier the next time. By getting
'into' a social group you will also catch some of their abilites, but also some
of their strategic party movement and other drawbacks.

The currency of P-A is gossip, when you are part of a conversation you will
catch some of the gossip there, but are in turn also expected to produce
other gossip not already known by the majority of the conversationists. If you
are unable to come up with something, you are ejected from this conversation
and have to look elsewhere. When you have acquired interesting gossip you
can always get some more gossip with it and will eventually get that piece
of gossip you need to become a party-success. This will score you points and
when you have enough points you will become a P-A. Other ways to score points
is to make the band play the kind of music everybody likes, to stand in line
at the buffet for the mayor and to impress unto the hosts of the party that you
are a starving artist or an excentric philosopher.

The game itself:
Every player can perform certain actions during a game turn and the actions
are resoluted by the MCP either in random order or according to which players
press really hard to move first. Of course there should be some kind of penalty
for pressing hard.
Possible actions include:
1.) altering one's strategic party movement by defining additional constraints
    like:
       -I won't talk to Ed McMahon.
       -I will only associate with people, who wear a tie.
       -I will always try to get as close as possible to a politician.
       -I will try to grab every drink coming my way within 3 feet.
Of course it should not be possible to alter the strategic party movement
imposed upon the player by the social group, but adding some more definitions
should be unconditionally permitted. So it probably is a useful idea if the
constraints determined by the social group were only one or two in number,
so that the player has some room to define additional ones.
2.) implicitly altering other people's party movement by:
       -wearing a tie.
       -telling tasteless jokes.
       -ranting about the incompetent government.
       -trying to make a pass at some beautiful man/woman/whatever.
       -etc.
3.) actually performing some strategic party movement. A player says for
example that he wants to go to the bar or to the conversation, where he sees
the mayor. Resolution of this movement is done by the MCP, which takes into
account other people's movement plans and everyone's strategic party movement
constraints.
4.) taking part in a conversation. The player can catch the newest gossip and
must deliver some himself.
5.) pushing (or popping) some drugs in the bathroom. (Only in the Hardcore P-A
variant :-)
6.) trying to make the party die by doing something really embarrassing

Finally some more juice will be injected into the party, when the MCP randomly
determines that some surprise guests or even party-crashers come by or the
Mayor's secret lover makes a scene.

After every game turn the player gets an evaluation, which tells him which of
his actions took place in what order and why they maybe didn't happen as he
planned. For example:

"You planned to go to the bar, if a barman was there, but there wasn't, so
you walked into the next conversation. They talked about 'gossip#429', which
you learned and can use from now on. Then they looked at you and according
to your specification for yuppie-conversation you produced 'gossip#12', which
everybody already knew, so you were ejected. Then some punk came near you
and you moved on. You briefly caught a glimpse of the mayor, but when you
arrived at the conversation the maximum number of people already took part
in it. At that time the buffet was opened and according to your specification
'buffet#3' you proceeded to stand in line. You secured a bowl of caviar and
according to your specification 'suck_up#5' offered it to the mayor, who
declined. Since none of your further plans were applicable (wrong music,
wrong people) you switched to 'default_routine#2' and stared thoughtfully at
the modern art sculptures. However, apparently no-one with the specification
'look_for_artsy_type#3' came along and the game turn ended. You are now
standing close to a rocker and the band and can interact with them next turn."

OK, that is hopefully enough to give you some kind of an idea of what a 
declarative game could be like in contrast to a procedural game.

Features of declarative games included in P-A are:
1.) Variable (maybe influencable) order of play and resolution is highly
dependent on who gets to move when.
2.) Resolution of actions driven by the current state of the party and the
actions of other players, not by a static set of rules.
3.) Players can influence resolution by changing the state of the party. When
they do so, they not only change the data, which the resolution algorithm
takes to compute something or other. Instead they change the data, but the data
is in fact the resolution algorithm itself, so they change the algorithm and
the order of when to compute what as well.

Features of declarative games not included in P-A are:
1.) Players cannot enlarge the party world by creating new guests with new
abilities and drawbacks, by defining new rules for the band or by making up
some new gossip.
2.) Players cannot throw a party themselves and determine who to invite.
3.) Players cannot define recursive plans. This is simply to make the
implementation easier and keep more control over what the players do.

The reason why these features are not included is playability, there is in fact
no implementation-related reason, why they couldn't be included. OK, that's it
so far and please feel free to comment on P-A and volunteer to implement it.
