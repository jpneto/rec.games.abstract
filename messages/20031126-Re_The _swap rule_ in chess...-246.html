Gosh, changing a rule will change the game. Amazing...

Just in case you're really this stupid:

Obviously, changing a rule changes the game. That isn't what I was 
talking about. I said it would change the CHARACTER of the game.

As an analogy, suppose you change the spot for a penalty kick in soccer 
(or football, depending where you're from) by 2 yards. Does this change 
the game? Yes. Does it change the character of the game? No, because the 
strategies are still the same, the play of the game is still the same, 
and the teams that were good before will still be good.

OTOH, if you change the rules so the goalie can no longer use his or her 
hands, that completely changes the character of the game. Some teams 
that were good might not be so good anymore. Scoring would go way up. 
Changes in game play might occur that we couldn't predict. THAT'S what I 
meant.
