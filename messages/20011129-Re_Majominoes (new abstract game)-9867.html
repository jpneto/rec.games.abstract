2) One player is 'X', the other 'O'.  X goes first, and players take turns
marking a cell with their symbol.  To offset the advantage of X going first,
O is allowed to make two marks during one (just one) of her turns.  Once a

I believe Torben is right in stating that this make the game a win for
O. A modification of the rules (which may or may not drastically alter
the game strategies) could be to allow X a double move after O has
made hers. This could be made a general rule - at any time, the player
in turn may mark two cells, if she has currently fewer marked cells
than her opponent.

Looking forward to trying it in real life.
