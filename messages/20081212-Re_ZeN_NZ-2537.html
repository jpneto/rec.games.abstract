If I may humbly suggest to all reasonable group members,
we might stop treating Mark Steere as an adult, and responding
to him as such.    He seems to have little idea of adult behaviour.

IMNSHO that's mostly irrelevant. I'd rather have someone who 
had a good grasp of the history and evolution of board games to 
post interesting, new and proven discoveries, and to attribute
to others that which was discovered and developed by others, 
to be an insulting sweary-Mary but <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>right<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, than someone who
takes into consideration other people's feelings but was ill-
versed in the field and wrong. (I could replace 'board games' 
with any other field I'm interested in, it applies to them all.)

It seems the problem with Mark is that he doesn't satisfy all 
the former criteria, the ones which would make an anti-social
attitude more forgivable, namely those about being well-
researched and giving attribution correctly.

Sure, his (re-)discoveries are interesting, but he really needs
work on the other components. (From my opinion, the thing he
needs to work most on is the 'proven' part, there are many 
suggestions put forward, but none seem to be given more than 
the most superficial testing to see whether they make sense at
all. I.e. I don't think he's ever actually played more than a 
tiny fraction of his 'games'.)

I tried the Vista speech recognition by running the tutorial. I was 
amazed, it was awesome, recognised every word I said. Then I said the 
wrong word ... and it typed the right one. It was actually just 
detecting a sound and printing the expected word! -- pbhj on /.
