Hi folks,

this is just a thought that crossed my mind this morning - the shower is a
really creative place.

I was thinking about card games and realized, that all (at least the ones I
know) card decks are two dimensional (value x suit or colour).
Has anyone ever thought of a three (or even four, five - well, I could go
on like this for quite a while...) dimensional card deck? The obvious (?)
design I came up with was: 
	VALUE x COLOUR x SIZE
If you give each dimension four possible values, you get 64 different cards, 
which looks like a nice deck-size to me.

Now, that we have the design - or at least a first attempt - we have to
find an application for it. Everything I could come up with up to now, is
very mechanical (i.e. boring :( ) so all comments on this thought would be
greatly appreciated.

	Ciao,
	   Uwe
