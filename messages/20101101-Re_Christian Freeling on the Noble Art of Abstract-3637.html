Michael, I tried ignoring Mark Steere but every now and then he makes
a personal attack and unlike the rest of the pussies in the abstract
games community I do not take these attacks lying down. I understand
why you say I should ignore him, don't feed the trolls, but a user on
RGA who constantly heckles designers and their games only to bolster
his own ego needs to be derided with extreme prejudice. All year Mark
has consistently made this the crummiest abstract game forum on the
face of the internet. It's a veritable ghost town here and I believe
that to be a direct consequence of his perpetual inane trolling
threads. In fact this isn't even my own theory, it was Nick Bentley
who told me this used to be a collection of some of the greatest minds
in the abstract games community until Mark drove them away with his
petulant behavior.
