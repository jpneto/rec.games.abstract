I am looking for help locating a program/s for the game Life.

I first heard of it a couple of weeks ago while reading David
Brin's latest novel, Glory Season.  (It's okay, but I prefer
his Sundiver universe.)

Then I ran across an article in Byte magazine, March 1994, about
how the author was trying to use Newton Script for programming
the same game.

It referenced a Scientific American article by Martin Gardiner
way back in Oct. 1970.  This article speaks of the works of 
John Horton Conway, Univ of Cambridge.  John started the game
apparently.

Anyway, those are my sources, here is my attempt to explain
how it is played...

---
Using a grid, with flat pieces of two colors, you lay down a
pattern and then apply some 'genetic laws' to determine how
pieces are born, killed, or survive.  You apply X number of
generations and watch.  The rules are:

 1. Every counter with two or three neighboring counters (out
    of the 8 possible) survives to the next generation.

 2. Every counter with &gt;= 4 counters dies. (overpopulation)
    Every counter with &lt;= 1 counter dies. (isolation)

 3. Every empty cell next to exactly 3 counters is a birth cell.
---

After following these rules patterns may emerge.  In the book,
it is played as a game with one team working against another.

My problem is that I know nothing about programing.  And I am
sure that this is already out there somewhere.  Anyone know
where? [Well, I do know some basic...]

Particularally, is there a program with variables for grid 
size, and the possibility to program how many generations you
can jump to, and even for changing the numbers related to
live, die, be born?

Thanks for your time,
Jeffrey S. Davidson
