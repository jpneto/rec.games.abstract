Well, I think I've actually found a newsgroup that can answer a question
like this:

I've been playing a solitare game called "Seahaven Towers" on my Mac.
(it's one of those solitare games that are a real pain to play
physically, so playing it on a computer really helps). It's a lot of
fun, and actually rather ADDICTIVE...

Quick rules: 52 cards, standard deck. Deal 10 columns of 5 cards each,
all FACING UP so you can see every card. Put the other two cards on two
of the special "docking" piles at the top. The object is to get all the
cards in four "finished" piles-- one for every suit, ace first. 

However, you can only move cards 3 ways (all ONE AT A TIME, only from
the buttom of a column)
	a. to one of the docking piles (anytime you want)
	b. to one of the finished piles (only if it is the next one in
		series.)
	c. to the bottom of another column, but only if you put it on 
		top of the next higher card in its suit. 

(if you are confused, let me know. It's something that is hard to
explain without actually seeing someone play)

ANYWAY, my question is this: from a theoretical point of view, should
this game be always win-able? How can I find out? Is there any good
books on this subject? I tried to sit down and work out some sort of
statistical sort of thing, but the game did not lend itself well to that
sort of analysis. 

(BTW: the game is shareware for the mac, so I'd be happy to email you a
copy... but... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED... :) )
