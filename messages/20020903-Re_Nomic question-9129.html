<br>Actually, if you've ever played chess online ... there ARE cheaters.

<br>You're right :) I've often thought that someone may pull that move on 
me... what's the point of playing if you can't win on your own? Of 
course, you're talking to a guy that got beat in chess by a friend who 
had his back turned the entire game and played from memory... ;-)

<br></blockquote>
<br>True, but the feeling I get from wasted time is worse than shame from a 
loss. At least in a loss, you may have gained by learning something from 
a fair game or appreciated the winner's winning strategy. Wasting time 
is just.... futile :)&nbsp; (redundancy check-- survey says: 92% !)
