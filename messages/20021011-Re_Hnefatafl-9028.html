But I've always assumed these may have been &gt;folk games" with rules that

are like languages -they have dialects that change as they move from

Exactly. Boards, rules &amp;c changed from place to place and over time. That's
why I reject the idea of 'the rules of Hnefatafl". They don't exist. When I
produced <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> version I gave it a different name (Maldon) because I
couldn't pretend that it was Hnefatafl, Tablut, &amp;c even though it's clearly
of that genre (and advertised as such).
It's the same with chess and draughts where one modern standard has taken
over nearly all - thankfully not quite all draughts (yet). having
experimented with an alternative version of chess I'd like to comment that
non-'standard' versions can be very refreshing - you can throw off the
weight of all those volumes of analysis and play a game for the fun of it!
