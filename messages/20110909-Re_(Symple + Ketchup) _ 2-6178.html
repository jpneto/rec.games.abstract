You can always play it with the Ketchup and Byg goal, but maybe that's
too similar to Ketchup (not sure if better or worse, though).

I'm very curious about this. I see some chance that it could turn out
to be better. Maybe.

It could end up that the feedback is too strong for the Ketchup goal
(so that both players fill the board with singletons before growing),
or it could lose some of the tactics due to the rule being invoked too
frequently in the mid to late game (much of the tension in Ketchup is
owing to the fact that you usually have a choice about whether to
activate the feedback rule, and the choice is hard).

 But if the rule doesn't suffer from these two problems, it could be
better.  At the very least, you'd no longer need a scoring track.

In any case, I'll try it out. If they work, I'd like to write about
them on my blog, with your permission, as a new game. Perhaps
coauthored, since it'll be your feedback goal + my win condition?
