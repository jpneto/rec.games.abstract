For all of you out there interested in the rules of awari.

Awari is played on a board where each side (south and north) has 6 pit
plus a auxiliary pit on the players right side of the board.
The board looks like this:

                     (North)
                f   e   d   c  b  a
aux.north                           aux.south
                A  B  C  D  E  F
                     (South)

Initialy each of the 12 pits (A..F for south and a..f for North) contain 4 stones.
(no stones will be put in the game later so 48 (12*4) as the maximum.
South makes the first move, then black, south, black, south...until the player
to can make no more moves. In which case the game is lost for the player
who is unable to move.

A move is made by picking up all stones for one of the pits on the player's
side of the board. He than "sows" them, anti-clockwise, one by one,
into the pits, starting at the pit on the right of his emptied pit.
If the last stone in a sowing lands in an enemy pit which already contains
1 or 2 stones, the player making this move captures all stones  in this pit
and puts them into his auxiliary pit  (the big one on the players right side).
If this happens the preceding pit also contains, after sowing, 2 or 3 stones,
they are also captured. This "harvest" is make in a clockwise direction,
and stops as soon as the player who made the move reaches a pit
containing less than 2 or more than 3 stones (after sowing), or when
he comes to the end of the opposing row.
It is not allowed to leave the opponent without stones!
So if the player to move has (for instance) 2 moves and when one
leaves the opponent without stones (because the move captures
all opponent stones), then the other move must be played.
(If all moves leave the opponent moveless, then it's allowed to capture
 all stones of the opponent and thereby winning the game)

The game ends when:
(a) One of the players has captured more then 24 stones. (he wins)
(b) One of the players can't move. (he loses)
(c) Both players agree to stop the game because the board position
     is continually repeated. (draw)

For normal non-capturing moves the notation is as follows:
[name of pit from which the move is made][number of stones moved]
(for instance: A4)

For captures the notation is as follows:
[name of pit from which the move is made][number of stones moved]x[number of stones captured]
(for instance: c7x2)

Changes (if this word can be used in this perfect information game) are about equal for both sides,
although tournament results show that 1. F4 gives south the better changes of winning.

The better programs use: alpha-beta search, proof-number search, transposition tables,
openingbook and a large endgame database for all positions with (currently) 17 stones
or less on the board (approximately 50Mb).

Have a nice time programming this.
If you have a working program, I am prepared to let it play against MyProgram by email!

P.S. a good source for more information on the subject are the books:

I forgot to say the when sowing more than 11 stones in Awari,
you have to skip the pit you started from.
