1.  Is there any sublte difference between Othello and Reversi?

Dunno about subtle, but there are differences.

In Othello, the game starts with two black and two white discs
in the central four squares.  In Reversi, the board starts
empty and the players' first two turns consist of placing a
disc in the central four squares.  Reversi, therefore, has
twice as many openings as Othello.

In Othello, if you can't move, you simply miss a turn.  In
Reversi, you hand your disc over to your opponent, who places
it (his side up, of course) and then has his own go.

2.  I believed that there are tow names for trademark reasons.
     Is that true?
     Are the games (names) protected?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The game first appeared under the name Annexation in the late
1800s.  It was relaunched as Reversi in the early 1900s (quite
possibly the 1920s, but I may be out by a decade or two).  Then
Othello appeared in the 1970s.  I do not know about the legal
status of any of these names, but the changes were made largely
to avoid clashes in the public mind.

3.  If I'm not mistaken I read some time ago about a winning
     strategy.
     Does one exist?
     If so, is it simlpe enough to spoil the game for humans?

I don't know, and almost certainly not, respectively.
