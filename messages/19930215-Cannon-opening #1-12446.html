From Xiangqi Game 1 to 3 I commented, noticed that Black's favourite
reply to the central opening is the contra-cannon or same direction
cannon opening. Of the 2, I personally favoured same direction cannon as
Black's chances of winning seems to be better.

Discussed below is a brief history of same direction cannon opening,
opening lines mainly adopted from mainland Chinese players.

Notation adopted is that accepted by Asian Xiangqi Federation.

Wayback in Ming dynasty, as published in "Sugar in the Plum" (literal
translation), same direction cannon opening was already conceived as a
strong response to Red's 1. C25

1  C25   C85
2  H2+3  H8+7
3  R12   R9+1
4  R2+6  R94

Of course, there is also the variation 3. R1+1 which I shall not discuss
here.

5  R23   H2+1
6  H8+9  R4+3
7  C87   A4+5
8  R98   R12
  
Main theme as described above. There may be some slight variations to
the above opening lines, but generally this opening had remained
stagnant from Ming dynasty up to 1960's. This contrasted with the
flourish and wealth of opening developed in Internation Chess during the
past hundred over years....

During 1960's, Hu Rong Hua (arguably the best Xiangqi player China ever
produces) introduces a very sweeping transformation to this opening. His
ideas came partly from Int Chess as he is also quite adept in Int Chess.

1. C25    C85
2. H2+3   H8+7
3. R12    R9+1
4. H8+7 !! ...

Though only 1 single change in the moves, but this has brought enormous
changes to the face of this entire cannon opening. His main idea is:
having two Horses at the central positions would bring more flexbility
and strength to both attack and defense.

However, this has brought another question: Red Horse on 7th file would
be under threat from Black's rook:
4.  ...    R94
5.  S3+1   R4+5  

How Red should counter this Black's Rook threat would determine the
success or failure of Hu's theory. Looking back now, I would say that
Hu's bravery in reforming this opening and many other openings have
brought much wealth and beauty to Xiangqi. Luckily, this modern opening
variation stood the test of time and has been successfully adopted in
many other opening lines.

In the next posting, I shall describe how Red counter 5 . ...  R4+5
threat.
