I'm lost.

Other than this the game looks pretty cool.  I made a board already.

If it's indeed in the contest then I'll need an answer soon as
tomorrow I'll present the hopefully finished boards and rules to the
people who come to the abstract games workshop at the spielwiese and I
don't want to waste peoples time with a game which isn't in the
contest or has a rule nobody can decipher.

I'm not sure if anyone will show up other than Dave, but here's the
advertisement I posted on the website to the games shop:
