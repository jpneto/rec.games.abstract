I don't see any of my chess training helping me at all in GO,
GO-MOKU, CHECKERS, PENTE or OTHELLO. So of the mental and
physical training though -- brain nutrition, meditation and
concentration exercises etc... , of course carry over to all
games of the mind.

I did a stint as a tournament checkers player in the seventies,
after I had acquired a rating around 1900 in chess.  I found my
chess skills helpful, but I also found that most checker players
were excellent players for people who had never played in a
chess tournament.
 
Rick Callaghan was a former Virginia State Chess Champion in 
the sixties, and a member of the US Postal Chess team.  In the
1970s he took up checkers and talked me into doing so.  Within a
decade Rick won a state championship (Utah) and a regional
championship.  I doubt a man who started serious checkers at his
age would have gotten that far without the training of chess --
if only through the acquisition of habits of analysis,
concentration, and the researching of positions.  
 
An alternative is that similar spacial abilities affect both
games. Thus, both may be tapping from the same pool of innate
abilities. 
 
One last comment is that I have met a few other chess players
who took up checkers.  One common thread is that most liked
endgames in chess.
