Two questions/challenges:

 2&gt;  Go with passing.  Awhile ago a go variant was discussed on
r.g.go  where a legal move was to pass and store up the move for
later use.  If you have 3 moves stored up then on your turn you can
make up to 4 moves in a row (all of which must be legal ... 2 eyes
is still enough).  How large must the board be before passing is the
correct first move?

I'm not going to look at 1xn boards, but the 2x2 board is trivial...passing
works easily.  Regardless of whether white then plays or passes, black can
play in two opposite corners, optionally capturing a white piece, and
making 2 eyes.  White has no move, and black wins by 2, 3 or 4 points,
depending on what counting system is used and whether white plays or
passes.  (Using Japanese rules, White will pass as well to lose by only 2
points.)  Question is, how many consecutive passes before the game is over?
Another, related, question:  If you have 3 moves stored up, can you make
just one or two moves or must you use them all?  (The answer to this
question results in two rather different games, I'd imagine.)
