 &gt;A few rules questions about Darse Billing's (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:darse@cs.ualberta.ca">darse@cs.ualberta.ca</a>)
 &gt;chessgammon game.

Oh, good! :-)

 &gt;&gt;On each turn, a player rolls two dice and moves two men (if possible) as
 &gt;&gt;indicated by those values.
 &gt;...
 &gt;&gt;If a player has no piece of the type indicated by a die roll, or if all
 &gt;&gt;pieces of that type have no legal move, then that die roll cannot be
 &gt;&gt;used (but the other die roll must still be used if possible).  It is not
 &gt;&gt;uncommon for all or part of a roll to be unusable.
 
 &gt;Q1) These rules contradict each other in the following situation:
 &gt;I roll a 1 2 and have no knights on the board. If I have a pawn
 &gt;on the 7th rank am I obliged to move it and promote it to a knight and
 &gt;then move the knight?
 &gt;The first statement seems to say yes but the second seems to say no.

The best rule seems to be that a pawn must promote to the indicated
piece if no other legal move is possible (ie. no piece of the indicated
type is already on the board).  The possibility of promotion means that
you effectively do have a knight to move.  However, if promoting to a
knight still leaves you with no legal knight move, you are free to
promote to any other piece (this is again consistent with backgammon
rules).  This also seems to be the best rule in practice, since otherwise
the threat of promoting near the enemy King is monstrous.

 &gt;Q2) Suppose I can move either one of the rolls but not both.
 &gt;In backgammon I am forced to move the larger. In keeping 
 &gt;the rules analogous do you want this to be the rule for chessgammon also? 

Yes, that is exactly the intention.  If only one piece can move, then
the higher die roll takes precedence.  This may result in being forced
to expose your King despite having another possible move.

 &gt;&gt; All other rules including castling and en passant
 &gt;&gt; captures, apply in the obvious way.
 
 &gt;Q3) Castling is technically considered a rook move right?
 &gt;Thus I can castle with any roll which includes a 4, but not with
 &gt;rolls which include a 6 (other than 46)

Castling is considered to be a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>King<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> move.  Therefore, a six must be
rolled before either the King or rook has been moved (you often need
liberties for the other rook to absorb early fours).  However, given that
it is already difficult to successfully castle, players may wish to allow
it on either a six or a four.  Castling always counts as one move (one
die roll), so a 6-4 may allow you to castle your King and make a second
move with your rook (for example: 6 4 0-0-0 Rxd8).  Castling through or
into check is allowed, as previously mentioned.

 &gt;Q4) In chess a player can claim a draw if a position is repeated 
 &gt;3 times.  For chessgammon, does cube value count as being part of
 &gt;the position or is it strictly the position on the board?

The location of the cube is considered to be part of the game position,
just as the possibility of an en passant capture is considered to be part
of a chess position.  Since the cube changes location every time it
changes value, the value must be the same for a draw by repetition to
occur.  Repetitions are obviously very rare, but it is possible to arrive
at sparse positions with little contact, where players may wish to agree
to a draw in order to save time.

Thanks for your interest.			Cheers,  - Darse.
