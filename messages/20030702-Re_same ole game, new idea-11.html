I think this thread belongs on a role-playing game newsgroup.  This newsgroup
is for games in the family of go, othello, hex etc. -- abstract games of
perfect information

I was debating to where I should place this thread, and, after
reviewing the choices, I decide this was the best place. R.P. Games
are so entwined with story telling that I did not want to take on that
burden; my core game ideas are vagarious in themselves; can you just
imagine if I tried to be a story teller, where it would take me,
surely under the wrath of soccer moms worldwide.


All games are abstract and used in ways to help us understand the
world around us. This core game that I am stumpy through is volatile
because it so closely resembles our world. Ok, 76578 86564 98125, or
at least the world I read about in those books collecting dust ALONE.

Games of chance, games of imperfect information, are so much better.
By God, sometime you can even feel that someone high above is really
watching and protecting you. It's a wonder experience, and I don't
mean playing those dumb casino games but the higher games of imperfect
information.


I prefer a balance, a little skill and a little lady luck.
