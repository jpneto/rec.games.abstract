Here's an equivalent way of formulating the Gyre rules:

"The perimeter cells and the single central cell of the hexhex board are designated as star cells.

"The game ends when there is a set of connected cells occupied by stones of the same color such that no set of connected cells outside of it includes a majority of star cells. The owner of the stones in the former set wins. Draws are not possible, and a board full of stones produces exactly one winner."

This allows for easy generalization: the game works with any odd number of star cells in any distribution. Seven star cells (the six corners plus the center cell) looks like a natural choice to me. Of course, three star cells on the corners of the Y board yields Y.

Also: turn star cells into movable neutral objects and you'll get a (hopefully interesting) Veletas-Gyre mix.
