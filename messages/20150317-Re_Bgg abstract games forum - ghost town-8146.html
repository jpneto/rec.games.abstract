Relax, no need to haunt me  :-)
As I wrote, I may indeed be wrong, and ms_designer may be somebody else. 
In any case, it's not like believing an account is a sock-puppet is a mortal offense :-)

Mister megamau, 
Do you think really that Rey Alicea deserves the label of game designer? 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't know; up to now I have not played any of his games. The reality is that nowadays there are more people that want to be abstract game designers than there are players.
I have a huge backlog of abstract games that I want to try, and testing prototypes is not my first priority.

In BGG you are just congratulating each other nothing more. 
Applauding is your best achievement. 
Asslickers present themselves as game designers!!! 
Mark and Massakra are not asslickers!!! 
The most disrespectful guy are the one`s who disrespect the intelligence &gt;&gt;of people not the one`s who use crude language to say the truth

I think there is a third way. You can "say the truth" without disrespecting people intelligence and without using crude language.

They are going soon to reach the conclusion that in fact they are mediocre &gt;&gt;game designers. They spend lot of blablabla (Ayatollah Russ is the biggest &gt;&gt;expert in that field) in unuseful theoretical questions having nothing to &gt;&gt;do with game design. 
My feeling is that they are a lot of guys coming to read what could be &gt;&gt;stolen as ideas. Only those who are either naive either provocative are &gt;&gt;presenting new games.

I don't understand why the theoretical questions are "unuseful". They are for sure useful to the people who participate. If you are not interested in them, simply don't participate in the thread. 
In the meantime you can start new threads on topics that you find "useful". How can you force other people to only discuss what you find interesting ?

In BGG no one is telling the truth. 
All those who are posting but me and Nark are liars dishonests and &gt;&gt;hypocrits. 
The forum is not the property of few but a property of anyone even if he &gt;&gt;or she is new member. You are acting like kids by tumbing up your maffia &gt;&gt;members. 
Even when a member say something wrong you thumb him up. 
Ny advise to you : close it!!! 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Here you seem a bit like those "conspiracy theorists". NO ONE is telling the truth ? EVERYONE is dishonest and hypocrite ? ONLY YOU and MARK know the truth ?
To me it looks like a very pretentious position to hold. What would be the point of such a "mafia" ? It's not like there is money to be made if people agree with you on the internet.
Just accept that sometimes people will disagree with you. I found myself holding the minority view many times. This does not mean that people where conspiring against me.

Create a ghetto where all those who are not kow towing can not be part of &gt;&gt;the community. Then you will be like someone talking to himself a &gt;&gt;"collective autist". 
You are behaving like a tribe or sect. 
As long as you are banishing people you do not agree with the forum will &gt;&gt;reach highest level of dumbness and incompetency. 
I was banished not for not respecting the charter (It is a big lie) but &gt;&gt;because I said my thoughts loudly! 
The first thing I respect is honesty and competency. 
I have no respect for dumb people trying to look smart.

The BGG forum is a moderated one, but there is no "ideology police". As long as you behave in a respectful way, nobody will ban you even if your positions are highly controversial.
Actually the moderators in BGG are not members of the abstract games community, so they will care very little about your controversial ideas on game design or originality. 
They only check if you adhere to the charter: no personal insults, no foul language, etc.

There are no cell hole!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????? and Nestor fill it and &gt;&gt;claim the win. 
No one intervene. The highly dumb Russ did not react. 
IT IS MORE INSULTING THAN ANY OTHER INSULT!!! 
Let alone the game itself which is very dumb!!!

I fail to see how a mistake in a play-by-forum game has anything to do with the topic at hand. Probably Nestor just made a copy-paste error, and nobody checked.
I don't know the game Dhex, but how is that thread a basis to consider anyone dumb ?
