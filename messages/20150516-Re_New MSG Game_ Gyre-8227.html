Where can I find the rules for Free Y?  A Google search yielded nothing. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Free Y is basically equivalent to Begird (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf</a>).   The only difference is that Begird uses "islands" of various lengths, including single cell islands, and Free Y only has single cell islands.

As I understand it,

I'm not sure if you do, Luis.  Twice you mentioned occupying the center cell which is neither necessary nor sufficient to win at Gyre, as is readily apparent from Figures 1 and 4.

this is Free Y with the provision that a tied game (impossible in 
that game thanks to the odd number of perimeter cells) is considered 
a win for the player who occupies the center cell.

That's like saying a bird is a monkey with wings and feathers.  As I said, it's a narrow class of games.  I.e., they're going to have a lot in common.  

These games solve a problem, which is something like* "What geometric principals can we use to divvy up the perimeter and prevent draws.  Y, Free Y, and Begird use boards with an odd number of perimeter cells.  Problem solved, but in a blue collar way.  It's the easy way out, and there's a price.  Aesthetic ding for the eccentric and triangular boards.  

On a regular hex hex board, you have to find other, more creative ways to prevent draws.  Atoll (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Atoll_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Atoll_rules.pdf</a>), of which Hex is but a special case, uses colored edge segments.  Gaia uses double, opposite edge placements to fill in the perimeter (effectively creating irregular, colored edges).  Gyre requires you to surround the center.

I wonder if it would just be preferable to allow the occasional race...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Not to me.  It's all about the geometry.  Not racing.  That's what Havannah's for.  But, if you are into racing (ding) and you don't care about draws (ding), you could eliminate the center cell (ding) from Gyre.

without the pie rule
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's a pretty big "without"!  The pie rule is an essential, if homely, workhorse in innumerable games, including Hex and Y.  What the pie rule lacks in elegance it makes up for in utility.

If Gyre is reasonable balanced by the pie rule, then "if it works don't fix it."

*Lariat (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Lariat_rules.pdf</a>) should be mentioned in a discussion of simple connection games.  It's more of a concept than a game, due to first turn advantage, but its simplicity is unparalleled.  "Form a path that surrounds the center and connects to an edge."  Boom.  No "such that's," "alternatively's", or "half the perimeter's" of Free Y.  Perimeter distances are irrelevant in Lariat.  The winning path need only touch the perimeter in one place.  Simple just got simpler.  Bill Taylor laughably proclaimed Free Y the world's "simplest game" while knowing about Lariat.

I feel like I've forgotten to insult someone...  Don't worry.  It'll come to me.
