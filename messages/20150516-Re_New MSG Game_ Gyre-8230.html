Happy to oblige, Luis.  You're wrong.  Or, I should say, still wrong.

Nope.  You could be tied at hex hex Free Y, occupy the center cell, and lose at Gyre.  You could also be tied at hex hex Free Y, with an enemy stone on the center cell, and win at Gyre.

Anything else?  Believe it or not, there's more to Gyre than winning the coin toss, placing a stone on the center cell, and proclaiming victory.

Of course you don't need to occupy the center cell if your winning chain is a win in Free Y as well, which should be most of the time.

this is Free Y with the provision that a tied game (impossible in

That's like saying a bird is a monkey with wings and feathers.  As I said, it's a narrow class of games.  I.e., they're going to have a lot in common.

That's true, and Gyre is a legitimate contribution to that class.
