[Nomic is a wonderful logical/legalistic/semi-meta- game in which the
rules refer to how to change the rules (at least initially).]

We are conducting a dignified Nomic game at a relatively leisurely
pace, with the intent of giving the participants plenty of time to
take care of the other details of their life (work, classes,
whatever). The game is designed to continue indefinitely, with
Speakerhood passed on to a winner whenever some players receive 100
points (at the moment).

Subscriptions to the mailing list and the Ruleset may be obtained by
mailing <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:nomic-request@reed.edu">&lt;nomic-request@reed.edu&gt;</a> . We are currently limited to &lt;= 8
players; to join, listen to the list for a while, and then petition
the current players for entry.

--------------- The Ruleset for Tabula Nomic -------------------

******************** Immutable Rules ********************

===== 101 =====

All Players must always abide by all the rules then in effect,
in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in the
Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
The Initial Set consists of rules 101-118 (immutable) and
201-220 (mutable).

===== 102 =====

Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the
200's are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted
(that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may
be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules
in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

===== 103 =====

At any time, each player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker; no
Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any time, there
shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in the Rules shall
specifically include both the Voters and the Speaker.

===== 104 ===== 

The Speaker for the first game shall be Jim Shea.

===== 105 ===== 

A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment, repeal,
or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
"Proposal" shall be synonymous with "Proposed Rule change".

(Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable,
may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are
mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be
transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)

===== 106 ===== 

All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number
of votes and Quorum is achieved.

===== 107 =====

Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted, it
must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

===== 110 ===== 

Rule Changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules
may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among votes
legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

===== 111 ===== 

In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable Rule, the
immutable Rule takes precedence and the mutable Rule shall be
entirely void.  For the purposes of this rule a proposal to
transmute an immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that immutable
Rule.

===== 113 ===== 

A Player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than
continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse than
losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be imposed.

===== 114 ===== 

There must always be at least one mutable Rule.  The adoption of
Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

===== 115 ===== 

Rule Changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply
Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible.
No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of
the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

===== 116 ===== 

Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is
permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of
changing an Official Document, which is permitted only when
a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.
Official Documents include the Rules, player's scores,
proposals, votes cast and voting records maintained by the
Speaker, the list of current players, and any other
document so designated by the Rules.

===== 117 =====

The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday, and lasts
for seven days.

===== 468 =====

Title: Non-Retroactivity 
 
Rule:
 
No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
application.

===== 489 ===== 
 
Title: The Numbering of Rules
 
Rule: 
        The Speaker must give each proposed Rule Change a number for
reference.  Each Rule Change proposed in the proper way receives as
its number an integer greater than that ever received by any other
Proposal.  A Proposal receives this number whether or not it is
adopted.
        If a Rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of
the proposal to reenact it.  If a Rule is amended or transmuted, it
receives the number of the Proposal to amend or transmute it.
 
===== 551 =====

Title: Agenda limits
 
Rule: No Player may submit more than three Agendas per Nomic week.
 
************************** Mutable Rules *******************

===== 202 ===== 

All Players begin with 0 points.  Points may not be gained, lost, or
traded except as explicitly stated in the Rules.

===== 210 =====

An adopted Rule Change takes full effect at the moment of the
completion of the Vote that adopted it.

===== 212 ===== 

If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the Rule
with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
  If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence
over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions shall
supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
  If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another or
defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

===== 217 ===== 

All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

===== 381 =====       

Title: Format of Proposals
       
Rule:
       
There are three sections to a proposed Rule Change defined by this
Rule.  The section must be preceded by its name (specified here within
angle brackets), and the name of the section must be at the beginning
of the line.
       
1. &lt;Action:&gt;
       
    This section describes whether this Proposal creates, transmutes,
    amends, or repeals a Rule.  Unless the Proposal is to create a
    Rule, the Action section must also specify the Rule that is being
    amended, transmuted, or repealed.  The Action section may not
    contain line breaks.  This section is required in all Proposals.
    It must be the first part of a Proposal.
       
2. &lt;Title:&gt;
       
    The Title section contains a short description of the rule (no
    more than 70 characters).  The Title section may not contain line
    breaks. This section is required only in Proposals to create or
    amend a Rule.
       
3. &lt;Rule:&gt;
       
    No text may follow this section.  This section is required only in
    Proposals to create or amend a Rule.
       
       
When a Proposal to create or amend a Rule is adopted, all of the
Proposal but the Action section will become the text of the Rule.

===== 395 =====

Title: legality of proposals
       
Rule:
       
As long as a proposal is legally submitted, it shall be considered a
valid proposal, even if the definition of what constitutes a valid
proposal should change while that proposal is up for vote. 
       
This rule takes precedence over all rules that seek to define the
syntax of valid proposals.

===== 401 =====

Title: Tucs (VII) transfers
Rule: A player may voluntarily transfer any number of Tucs
to any other player for any purpose, by sending a message
stating so to the Public Forum, within the following
limits: a) a player may only transfer a positive, integral
          number of Tucs;
        b) a player may not transfer more Tucs than he/she
          currently has.

===== 408 =====

Title: Cancelling debts
     
Rule:
        If the Debt Account for some entity indicates that some
        Player A is in debt to some Player B, then player B
        may elect to cancel that debt, by posting a message to
        the secretary of the Debt Account stating the fact.
      
        The secretary shall then remove that debt from the Account,
        and inform player A that the debt has been cancelled.

===== 412 =====

Title: Freedom of Information Act

Rule: Players may, at any time, request the contents of a
long-lived Official Document.  The Player responsible for
that Document must then supply a replica of that document
to the reqesting player in an easily-readable form
(preferrably electonic mail, but other forms may be
negotiated between the requesting player and the Document
holder) as soon as possible.

===== 423 =====

Title: Judicial Qualification

Rule: Each player shall be either Qualified or Disqualified
with respect to any Call for Judgement which has been
submitted.  A player may not simultaneously be both
Qualified and Disqualified with respect to a given CFJ, and
a player shall be Qualified with respect to a given CFJ
unless otherwise stated or implied by the rules.

The player who submits a CFJ is Disqualified with respect to
that CFJ, as is any player who has previously served as a
Judge for that CFJ and who failed to return a judgement on
that CFJ in accordance with the rules, and any player On
Hold. 

===== 424 =====


Title: Contracts

Rule: 

a. A Contract may be made between any number of Players.  The Players
   agreeing to a Contract are known as "Participants".

b. Participants must abide by the provisions of a Contract.

c. A Contract may not stipulate when or if a Player shall rule on a
   Judgement.

d. A Contract may not stipulate that a Player leave the game.

e. Should a Rule and a Contract come into conflict, the Rule will
   always take precedence over the Contract.  At no time shall a
   Contract be interpreted as requiring a Player to violate any Rule.

f. In order to agree to a Contract, each Participant must submit a
   message to the Public Forum consisting of two parts.  The first
   part contains text indicating that the Player distributing the
   message agrees to the Contract.  The second part contains the
   Contract.  Every Participant must distribute the same Contract for
   the Contract to be considered valid.

===== 429 =====

Title: Additional Disqualification Criteria
      
Rule: The player who submits a CFJ may submit with the
statement to be judged a single statement to the effect that
one other player is to be Disqualified with respect to that
CFJ. If such a statement is submitted, then the indicated
player shall immediately be Disqualified with respect to
that CFJ.  The Custodian of the Bar shall distribute any
such statement along with the statement to be judged.

Within 72 hours of the announcement of the identity of a
Judge any player other than the player who submitted the CFJ
may send a message to the Public Forum asking that the Judge
be Disqualified with respect to that CFJ. No player may send
more than one such message per CFJ. If at least 30% of the
current players send such a message, or if the Judge emself
sends such a message, the Judge shall become Disqualified
w.r.t. that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be selected. If the
Judge emself sent such a message, es Acuity shall be reduced
by 2 immediately prior to the selection of the new Judge.

If a Judge becomes Disqualified after being selected, and is
not subsequently re-selected for that same CFJ, e shall not
be required to return a judgement for that CFJ, or, if e
does or has already done so, that judgement shall be
destroyed.  In this case the player in question shall incur
no rewards or penalties for returning or failing to return a
judgement.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that
would require such a player to return a judgement or reward
or penalize em for returning or failing to return one.

===== 433 =====

Title: The Conservation of Points.

Rule: Points shall be conserved.

===== 434 =====

Title: Description of the Current Player List

Rule:  The Current Player List shall consist of two columns.
The leftmost column shall consist of the names of the 
current players and the rightmost column shall read either 
"Active" or "On hold" reflecting the current status of each 
player.  Names shall be added to this list by resolution.  
This rule takes precedence over any other rule specifying 
how players shall be added to the current player list.

===== 435 =====

Title: Bonus for small proposals

Rule: Whenever a Proposal passes that is no longer than ten lines
(blank lines not included) and that counts less then 80 characters per
line (trailing blanks not included), the Player to propose that
Proposal shall receive one Point.


===== 438 =====

Title: Legal Judgements

Rule: A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
Judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.

Rule: The number of players shall be limited to eight.

===== 449 =====

Title: Default rules for Executive Orders:
 
Rule: 
 
An executive order is a decree made by an Officer which has some
immediate effect on the Game State.  The executive orders available to
any given Office, and the way in which they may be used are specified
in the rules governing that office. Executive orders may, in general,
affect the Game State in arbitrary ways, but rules for Offices'
executive orders may not conflict with this one. This rule takes
precedence over all rules for Offices where they may conflict.
 
All executive orders must be logged in the Executive Record (an
Official Document as per rule 116) by the Player or Officer
responsible for its maintenance. When an Office is
given the ability to make an executive order, the description of that
order must include a method by which the action of that order can be
reversed at any later stage.
 
An executive order may be reversed if a Judgement determines that it
was illegally made. In this case, the Game State must be restored as
per the method specified in the description of the order.

Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a
word or phrase by a synonym as well as whitespacing and capitalization

===== 492 =====

Title: Winning by Points
 
Rule:
 
The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.
If more than one player achieves this condition simultaneously, all
such players win.
When a game ends in this manner:
  -If there is only one winner, that player becomes the Speaker, and
   the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
  -If there is more than one winner, the Speaker randomly selects one
   of the winners, who becomes the new Speaker, and the old 
   Speaker becomes a Voter.

===== 575 =====

Title: Resolutions

Rule:

2.  A Resolution is a short-lived Official Document describing a
       modification to any long-lived Official Document except the

          suggested.
       The Resolution itself must also be clearly marked as such.
4.  Resolutions are suggested by sending them to the Public Forum.
5.  The player suggesting a Resolution shall be its votekeeper.  Valid
       votes on a Resolution are "FOR" and "AGAINST".
6.  If "FOR" wins the vote, the Resolution is passed, and the
       modification described in the Resolution will take effect as
       soon as the vote has been completed.  Otherwise, the Resolution
       fails.
7.  Resolutions that would cause any player to gain or lose points or
       TUCs as a direct result of passage of that Resolution shall
       require a 2/3 "FOR" vote to pass.
8.  Resolutions cease to exist at the end of their voting period.

Title: The Reserve.
 
Rule: 
      
Let there be an entity known as the Reserve.  This entity may contain
any conserved entity.  This entity or its contents may not be altered
unless a Rule or Rules so declares.
      
This Rule defers to Rules which restrict the movement of certain
conserved entities in and out of the Reserve.
      
No Rule shall be prevented from causing an entity to be taken from the
Reserve simply because that action would cause the Reserve to hold a
negative quantity of that entity, unless this prevention is
specifically mentioned by a Rule.
      
Any Rule or change in the game state which calls for a conserved
entity to be taken from a source, but does not state a destination for
this entity, shall use the Reserve as the destination.
      
Any Rule or change in the game state which calls for a conserved
entity to be given to a destination, but does not state a source for
this entity, shall use the Reserve as the source.
 
If the Reserve may contain a certain entity, then a player may always
deposit a quantity of that entity which it owns into the Reserve by
imnmediately announcing this fact to the Public Forum.  This act is
known as "spending".

Title: Selection of the Judges.
       
Rule: Let there be an Official Document known as the
Measure of Acuity.
       
This document shall contain only player names followed by
integers, one such pair per line.  Each of these integers
shall be known as the Acuity of the player which they
immediately follow.
       
If a player's name is not listed in this Document, its name
shall be added to this document, followed by an Acuity of 1.
If a player leaves the game, the line containing its name
shall be removed.
       
The Custodian of the Bar shall accurately maintain this
document and distribute a facsimile of it to the Public Forum
as soon as possible after a Judgement has been called for.
       
Selection:
       
When the rules call for selection of a Judge, the following
numbered events shall immediately occur in order.
       
0. All players' Acuity shall increase by 1.
1. A Judge shall be selected at random from among all
   players with a positive Acuity who are at that time
   Qualified with respect to that Judgement. Each of these
   players shall have a (Acuity of that player) / (Total
   Acuity of all players with positive Acuity Qualified
   w.r.t. the judgement) chance of being selected. If no
   Judge is selectable by this method, one shall be selected
   randomly among all players, with an equal chance for each.  
2. Each player shall lose 10%, rounded down to the next
   integer, of all Acuitii that they own.
3. The Custodian of the Bar shall reveal the identity of the
   Judge to the Public Forum as soon as possible.
       
Feedback:
       
Within one week of the return of a Judgement, all players
but the Judge may inform the Custodian whether they think
the Judgement was SOUND or UNSOUND.  The Judge shall gain 1
Acuity for every player who finds the Judgement SOUND in
this manner, and lose 1 Acuity for every player who finds it
UNSOUND in this manner.
 
===== 585 =====

Title: Syntax and Semantics of the Roll
 
Rule: Let there be an official document known as the Roll.  The Roll
shall consist solely of two columns of text. The first column shall
consist only of a list of all Offices in existence, one per line,
sorted alphabetically. In the second column to the right of each
Office shall be placed the name of the current holder of that Office,
if any, and no other text. Upon passage of this amendment, the Roll
shall contain one such line for each Office in existence immediately
prior to passage, regardless of whether the creation of those Offices
involved specific changes to the Roll.
      
An Office is any set of functions so designated by the rules. The
terms "Official" and "Officer" are synonymous with "Office."  Only
players may hold Offices, and no Office may be simultaneously held by
more than one player. The act of adding or changing the holder of an
Office in the Roll is known as "appointing" the new holder to the
Office.
          
No player shall be appointed to an Office without its consent. The
player holding an Office may at any time send a message to the Public
Forum resigning that Office. On resigning, an Officer may optionally
name a different player as a successor. If the named player indicates
es consent in a message to the Public Forum within 72 hours of being
so named, e shall immediately be appointed to that Office; if e fails
to do so e shall have refused appointment. If no successor was named,
or if the named successor refuses appointment, the Office shall become
vacant.
          
If a Rule states that an Office has a default Officeholder, then if,
at any time, the Roll does not state who holds that Office, the Roll
shall be modified so that the default Officeholder holds that office.
          
This Rule takes precedence over all mutable Rules governing Offices,
except that it shall defer to any Rule which governs the conditions
under which a Player may be appointed to or resign a particular
Office, or the receipt of a salary by an Officer, and then only to the
extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

===== 586 =====

Title: Salaries, Duties, and Requirements of Officers
 
Rule:
 
A duty of an Officer is any function or action so stated in a Rule or
Rules.  A requirement of an Officer is any function or action so
stated in a Rule or Rules.
 
If   a Rule or Rules cause an Officer is to receive a salary on a
     particular Nomic Week,
and  that Officer has not performed one or more of the duties of that
     Office during the Nomic Week immediately previous,
and  a player or players announces this fact to the Public Forum
     during that previous Nomic Week,
then that Officer shall be fined the amount of that salary at the
     beginning of the next Nomic Week.
 
Otherwise, that Officer shall receive that salary.   
 
If   an Officer has not performed one or more of its requirements
     during a Nomic Week,
and  a player or players announces this fact to the Public Forum
     during the Nomic Week immediately following,
then that Officer shall immediately be removed from Office.
 
The default salary for an Officer shall be one third as many points as
there are current players, rounded up to the next integer.  The
default payday for an Officer is the beginning of the Nomic Week.  An
Officer shall not receive a salary unless another Rule so states.

    consented to be appointed to that Office.  Otherwise, the chosen
    Player may, within 72 hours of this message, send a reply to the

    Office. If e fails to send such a reply within 72 hours, e shall
    have refused appointment.
 
4.  If the chosen player consents to the appointment, e shall
    immediately be appointed to the Office in question. If the chosen
