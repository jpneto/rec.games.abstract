Here is a game for any plural number of players. Start with an n-by-n

That puts an upper limit on the number of players, since the human eye
can only distinguish approximately 10,000,000 colours.

In the case there are more than 10 million players, players should
mark each section with a symbol or with their name. Since many players
will have the same names, in this case, follow each name with a
number: Like "James Albert Eugene 8165237", say.
Still, the grid will have to be less than the size of the universe,
and so this limits the number of players, since, one, a grid too small
can't be subdivided into enough sections to let every player claim at
least one section, and two, there are only so many potential players
in the universe anyway.

Players add up the total area of all the sections in each player's
color, with the area of a grid-square being 1. (This may be tricky
because some sections will most probably have non-integer areas.)

Not so tricky. Count the interior vertices (bounded by, but not
coincident with, the borders of a given colour area). Add half the
number of vertices that <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> coincide with the border, including any
that are collinear. Subtract 1. The result will be either integral or
integral + a half. If there are any "holes", add the number of holes to
the sum. Your final result is the area of the coloured section. (Pick's
Theorem.)

Ah, yes, Pick's theorem. I forgot about that. Not so tricky, then.

Thanks,
