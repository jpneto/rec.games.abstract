CodeCup is a yearly programming contest in which anyone can participate. Every year a different abstract game is selected, and the challenge for programmers is to create a bot for it. Then a tournament takes place in which all the bots play against each other to determine a winner.

I'm really happy to say that my game Ayu has been selected for next year's edition. I'm looking forward to see how bots handle it!

The official competition begins in January, but a number of test competitions will be held before, starting at the end of September, so that participants can fine-tune their creations. All of this can be followed in the contest's website.

I wish to publicly thank Christian Freeling for his support to my game. It was him who recommended Ayu to the organizers, and I think it wouldn't probably have been selected otherwise.
