Hey, just have the games submitted anonymously - 
none of the judges know who created it.  someone
like Daniel receives them from each of the competitors
and assigns them a number in order of email arrival.
he could then forward the bare rules without names to
someone like Greg to implement the human vs. human
interface at a website for the judges.

Lots of problems.  Mainly it's too robotic.  Waiting for secret judges to
vote on secret games sounds like a borefest.  We're lucky that Greg decided
to program some of the games this time, but we can't bank on "someone like
Greg" programming all of the games for future contests.  Even coming up with
judges is tough.  I don't want to be one.  My aversion to games, with rare
exceptions, is well known.  I especially don't want to be excluded from
entering a contest because I have to play and judge the games in it.

What's with the flurry of "solutions" lately?  We've already got a plan
worked out for the current contest.  Daniel is creating physical versions of
the games to play in real life, and the judges are going to rate them.  In
fact the judging period has already started.  Why don't we see how the
current contest works out before scrambling to rework the format for future
contests?
