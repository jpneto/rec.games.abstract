Dear Hans and all,

first i want to express my gratitude for your wonderful work. Your
page is an excellent resource for all lovers of abstract games. It is
difficult to say, but it might be the best page available. You give so
much information that it appears that you must work day and night.

Classification what is a `chess variant' seems a hard task.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't believe that there is only one correct classification.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
For many criteria,
one can come up with examples that show that the criterium is somewhat
`wrong'.

For example, if we look to the goal of the game, what about Losing chess?
Seems a `chess variant' to me? (Rules: chess, but capture obligatory, and
winning by getting rid of all your pieces; kings not royal.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

According to a historic classification system, this is true. However, i
have used an a-historic (!!) system (expressis verbis). You use Go stones
and a Go board to play Gess, but according to most Go players it is
definately not a Go variant (although you call it a cross and was surely
influeced by knowing Go).
Losing chess is not about capturing / mating your opponent's king(s). It is
about losing your pieces. For that reason I would put it into the same family
as Losing Draughts (English?) (Schlagdame in German). This is hard to digest
for chess fans, but as I said, I use a system that is sharp as a knife and
sometimes logic hurts (but it also opens new horizonts).


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In fact, for about every criterium, you could take FIDE-chess, and modify it
only slightly just to make that criterium wrong, and often get something that
feels like a variant of chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It would be interesting to construct a classification system of abstract
games based on the feeling. But how do you determine / "measure" the feel
of a game? In an empirical / psychological study?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Giving a classification of what is a `chess variant' thus is rather hard, and
I think it'll be impossible to find one that satisfies everybodies taste.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sure. But it cannot be our goal to satisfy everybody. Also, once again:
there is NOT one correct system. I want to do science, not religion.
However, i believe that the system used by R. C. Bell in his game books is
neither historically correct nor logically consistent (nevertheless, i'm
glad to own his books). His "system" is very arbitrary, and i wanted to
avoid such a subjective pseudo-system.


Ralf
