I'm fairly sure I've abused the term.  I'm just saying that we could
use at least one example of a UCT based Oust program to draw some
conclusions from, much like what Christian has tried to do with
Havannah.

Actually there are Castro, Deep Fork, Wanderer, Gambler, Ring von
Fehler and Shakti (a havannah bot that has the name of one of my other
games), to name a few, and the conclusion is that UCT is a stronger
approach (in havannah!) than an alpha/beta search based on a
traditional evaluation function.

Of course it's far above my head in terms of what these guys - Timo
Ewalds, Thomas Reinhardt, Richard Lorenz, prof. Johannes Waldmann,
prof. Ingo Althofer, Richard Pijl, Fabien &amp; Olivier Teytaud and others
- are actually doing, because they're approaching it from different
angles and with different results. UCT isn't a single straight
road,obviously, and the programs differ in strenght and style.
For what it's worth, Castro (Timo Ewalds) is currently the one I fear
the most. Losing base-9 because of a bad plan and not being able to
turn the tables is a wake-up call.

[UCT is a stronger approach (in havannah!) than an alpha/beta search

That's not surprising at all given past success in Go and other
connection games.

[UCT isn't a single straight road, obviously, and the programs differ
in strenght and style.]

It's also not surprising that it's being approached from different
angles, the exciting part is that the technique is ripe for innovation
when applied to new games.  The term "Never say never" comes to mind
when one considers: Samuel's Checkers-playing Program, Chess 4.0, Deep
Blue, Hexy, Queen-Bee, Chinook, (I'm certain I've left off some key
ones) etc...
