I did an update to the defintions document, to make what qualifies as
an abstract strategy game and lay out the boundaries:
Pure abstract strategy games tend to be noted by what they lack: theme
and luck. They are also noted by what do have: simple rules and
perfect information. Of course, some notable games, such as backgammon
and blind chess (kriegspiel) have been debated whether or not they
fall under the abstract strategy category, because they deviate from
the pure form. Theme has also been a debatable point, as even chess
has been called into question whether or not it is themed, and thus a
pure abstract strategy game. A universally accepted standard of what
is or is not an abstract strategy game may never come about. However,
in regards to an organization such as IAGO, the hope is a sufficiently
detailed standards will function to provide a stable base to operate.

Because of the debate, and the needs of IAGO, this document goes
beyond merely definitions. Its purpose to look beyond the definition
to come up with a unifying model to describe all abstract strategy
games. The model also is broad enough to cover most boardgames.
Reasons for this minutia is provide sufficient depth for modeling all
abstracts. The practical application of this document will come in the
form of additional IAGO standards documents.

You can see the document here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/definitions-of-abstracts">http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/definitions-of-abstracts</a>

I hope this does a better job for people.  I also added created an
additional criterion of acceptance document.
