I agree with Nick here. In Yodd, a group in the center is not likely
to become a burden at all. It's the ideal place from which to spread
influence across the board and connect your groups in the future. In
Xodd it could be a bit different, because isolating groups is easier,
but anyway.

Boy is this game difficult to grasp. It really requires an applet and
a fair couple of games to get any idea at all. No telling what comes
out of it in the end in terms of strategy and tactics, except that it
will be inticate. I remember coming across a very early havannah
position once, some 25 years later, and the most striking thing was
that it didn't look like a havannah position at all, despite the fact
that havannah can have widely different types of positions. It's the
same as a Chess player recognizing a position as silly on sight, you
immediately <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>see<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> something is wrong. It illustrated how thinking
about strategy had solidified over the years.
