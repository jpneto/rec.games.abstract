The American Go Association (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.usgo.org">http://www.usgo.org</a>) put this up on their
website, after Bridge had been indicating it is on. Think of this as
an Olympics for mental competition.  The news:

1ST INT'L MIND SPORTS GAMES SET FOR 'O8 IN CHINA: (9/30/2007) The
First International Mind Sport Games will be held in Beijing in
October, 2008, reports Roy Laird, Chairman of the AGA Board of
Directors. Calling it "An Olympics for mental competition," Laird
tells the EJ that "The concept became a reality on September 26, when
International Mind Sports Association (IMSA) President Jose Damiani
announced that the four IMSA members (Go, Bridge, Chess, Draughts),
along with Xiang-Qi  (Chinese Chess), will hold the first ever World
Mind Sports Games (WMSG) from October 3 through 18, 2008 in Beijing,"
which will have just hosted the Olympic games a few weeks before. This
will be the first such international mind sport competition under
General Association of International Sports Federation (GAISF)
auspices. "GAISF works closely with the Olympics movement, but don't
expect to see go being played between ice skating and gymnastics on
Wide World of Sports," says Laird. "Instead, a parallel set of
competitions is evolving, through the recently formed International
Mind Sports Association." It is expected that more than 2,500 players
from over 100 countries will compete in 25 to 30 medal events in the
WMSG. In addition to individual events, team and pair competitions
will be also be held. "Through the International Mind Sport Games,
more people will become aware of the value and joy of mental
competition," says Laird, who promises that "American players will be
there! But we're going to need your help. The American Go Foundation
is seeking sponsors who would like to support the 2008 US go team with
a tax-deductible donation. Your employer might also appreciate the
opportunity to support such a historic event."
