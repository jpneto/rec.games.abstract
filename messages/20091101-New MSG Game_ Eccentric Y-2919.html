Do the two MSG games, Eccentric Y and Hex Hex Y, solve Bill Taylor's
"perennial problem"?

Let's see:

"(a) to make a connection game on a Hex-hex board,"

  Check.

"(b) which is win/loss complementary, (like Hex, Atoll, and Y),"

  Check.

"(c) whose winning criterion includes some sort of Y connection,"

  Check.

"(d) but EXcludes winning merely by crossing between opposite sides."

  Check.

"Various attempts have been made."

  Check.

"No move shall be made that physically prohibits the construction
 of a Y-group by the opponent, unless that move immediately
 wins for the player".

  A tad cumbersome and a direct consequence of condition (b), but yes,
Check.

"The dream of finding a game to satisy all of (a) to (d) above is
chimerical."

Definition of "chimerical":
  1. unreal; imaginary; visionary
  2. wildly fanciful; highly unrealistic

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  The two MSG games I released
in the last four days seem to satisfy all the criteria.  Why this is a
"perennial problem" for Bill Taylor is beyond me.  Maybe he just
doesn't have the nuts.
