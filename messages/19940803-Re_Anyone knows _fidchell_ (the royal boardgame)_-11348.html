 The 3M game was called "Breakout!" The "king" sat in the middle of the board
surrounded by his men. Encircling those pieces were the opposing pieces. As I recall, both sides could set up in any formation they desired; howver, the King's men were restricted to a block of squares in the center of the board when setting up. The object was to lcear a path for the king to escape (breakout) to the edge fo the board. I think all the pieces moved like rooks in chess.
