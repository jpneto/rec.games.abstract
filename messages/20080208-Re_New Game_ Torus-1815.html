No, I'm right, and you're wrong.

And you're also far too quick off the mark with these posts.
You'd do a lot better to reflect for a while each time.

They are not.

That has nothing to do with it.  They are clearly different in 2D.

You have totally overlooked the force of this comment.
You are making it very difficult to be polite to you.

In your game, as in mine, one player has a possible goal of forming an
N-S loop and the other player a W-E loop.  So it's way beyond me how
you arrived at the conclusion that your game has equal goals and mine
doesn't.

Obviously!   That is a great pity.  I had previously formed the idea
that you were a logical and careful thinker and designer of games.
I see I was wrong!

Here is a simple explanation.  I hope it is simple enough for you.

Please note that the NS player can ensure a loop with just 2 stones!
The EW player has no such option.

Are we learning anything yet???

 I wouldn't release an unequal goals game.

You just did.
