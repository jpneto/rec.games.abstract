I propose a game of Nomic, to be carried out by email. 
If there are no objections, certain minor additions to the rules will be 
made in advance.

The immutable (100-level) rules will remain as-is initially; the 200-level
rules will be amended as follows (note these are mutable rules):

214 A list of players shall be maintained by the moderator of the game,
in this case me (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:boutell@cshl.org">boutell@cshl.org</a>). The means by which one joins the
game is by sending email to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:boutell@cshl.org">boutell@cshl.org</a>. A reasonable period shall
be permitted during which players can join before the game begins,
after which the game will be closed. Enrollment in the game shall
commence immediately.

215 Rule 201 shall be amended as follows: "players shall alternate in
clockwise order, taking one whole turn apiece..." shall become 
"players will submit moves, one whole turn apiece, to the moderator, when 
informed that it is their turn to play. The moderator shall establish
an order of play before the beginning of the game and distribute this
order of play to the players. The moderator must adhere to the order
of play. Rules received out of turn shall be ignored..."

216 If a player takes more than three (3) days to make a move, the
next player shall be permitted to submit a move for them, in addition
to submitting their own. If this player fails to move in the allotted
time, the next player moves for both preceding players and for
his or herself, and so on.

217 When a move, with its proposed rule or rule change, is submitted, the
moderator must promptly inform the other players of it. All votes received
within two (2) days of the announcement of the move shall count. Moves
received later do not count. 
The success or failure of the change must be reported by the
moderator to the players, and the next player promptly informed it is
their turn to move.

218 "Eligible voter", in all preceding and subsequent rules,
shall be defined as "all those who have responded in the two (2) - day
period."

219 A digest of the game shall be posted to the group rec.games.abstract
by the moderator on a regular basis.
