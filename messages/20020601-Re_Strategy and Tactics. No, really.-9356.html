Now boys, I think you're missing the forest for the trees (or to put it
another, more apropos way, you're missing the STRATEGY for the TACTICS - hee
hee!). This was supposed to be a discussion on how to differentiate strategy
vs. tactics. While I find the growth of this discussion fascinating, perhaps
it belongs in its own thread? Perhaps with the title "Kasparov vs. Big Blue
II: desJardins vs. Rhoads". Or something like that. I would definitely
follow it because I think you both make some very interesting points.

Anyway, I still like my definition of tactics vs. strategy (see above...
WAAAAYYYYY above).

The fact that such a strategic looking sacrifice had never occurred

Nonsense.  There has to be a first time for anything.  Because no one
has run 1500 meters in less than 3:25, would you say, "People are not
supposed to be able to run 1500 meters in less than 3:25"?  It's silly.

This is a nonexistent distinction.

Suppose you are playing a game (chess, go, whatever) against a
computer and further suppose you are not aware of any instances of a
computer program using strategy X.  Now suppose that much to your
surprise, the computer program uses strategy X.  Your reaction might
be

"Whoa!  I didn't know a computer program could do THAT!"

or equivalently,

"What?!  Computer programs aren't supposed to be able to do THAT!"

The two statements aren't equivalent.  But I wouldn't say either one.  I
know that, in fact, a computer program can do anything that a human can
do.  It's only a matter of time, whether it's happened yet or not.  I
might say, that I wasn't aware that computer programs had <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>yet<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> reached
a particular level of achievement.  But that would not at all be the
same as saying they are not "supposed" to be able to reach that level.
