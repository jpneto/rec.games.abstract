  Ever seen the movie "Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"?
  There is a fascinating scene in the movie where the two engage in an
oral contest that seems to follow scoring for tennis and in which the
players engage in a conversation but cannot break established rules lest
they suffer penalties.  I'd have a very hard time describing it any
further as the movie didn't explain the rules, but it seemed to revolve
around some sort of semantic or grammatical guidelines that couldn't be
broken.  Watch the movie if you can.
  For those who have seen it - is this a real game and if so, does anyone
know where the rules can be found?

The game shown in R &amp; G are D is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Questions.  It is a mind blisteringly
similar game called "Verbal Tennis" (thus the tennis court).  As with
Questions, the could of the game is to bandy questions back and forth,
without repeating or making a statement.  The conditions of relevancy must
be observed, and unanswerable questions (rhetoric and philosphy) are banned.

Scoring is not exactly like tennis.  The match consists of the best 2 of 3
games rather than 3 of 5 sets of first to win 6 games each (the latter would
wear the novelty rather thin, eh?).  There is no "set", but that doesn't
prevent use of the line "game set and match" to announce victory.

The game pre-dates R &amp; G are D ... it appeared in a novel with a name
like "The Fox in the Air" (memory fails as to whether that is the exact
title, but I think it's close)
