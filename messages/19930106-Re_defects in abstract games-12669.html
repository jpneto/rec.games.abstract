In my (not very sophisticated) understanding of Chess, the weaker player
can try to reach a draw by forcing the stronger player into a situation
where any departure from a repetitive sequence is a disaster.  If the
repetition were simply ruled to be illegal, the idea of what constitutes
a strong position would change.  But the rule that no captures for some
number of turns is a draw could be unchanged.  It seems to me that this
is fairly simple, and removes many draws.  Is it a bad idea for some
other reason, am I missing something, or do some people consider the
draws desirable?
 
The latest candidates for 'flawless' games seem to be Hex, Traxx and
Twixt.  These are all games involving a sequence of placed pieces, with
no moves or captures.  If I'm remembering 'Winning Ways' correctly,
these games can all be reduced to Nim or Sprouts, and can be solved
without exploring the entire game tree.  I speculate that any game which
does not have the potential of infinite duration (thus requiring the no
repeats rule or some equivalent) is in the general class of games that
can be reduced to Nim.  Does anyone know of any proofs or disproofs of
this speculation?
