   Ridiculous? then instead of posting irrelevant trivia, why don't
you address the issue that was raised.  Jonathan Schaeffer admitted that
the title had not been legitimately won.  Is it not poor sportsmanship
to accept a title that has not been legitimately won?  If not, why not?

Mr. Fong, you are not a very careful reader.  We won the title LEGITIMATELY

    Who's being careless here?  Do you deny posting the following:

	``Had we legitimately won the title, we would have immediately
	resigned it and the program would have probably been retired.''

Your own words.  Now you're saying the win was legitimate *according to
the rules of the match*.  However that is a different sense than the one
which YOU yourself alluded to in the above quotation.  Which is the sense
my comment about sportsmanship was apropos to.
    Who's being careless here?  Your previous posts (apparently in response
to something i wrote?) addressed many "points" that neither i nor anyone
else raised in this thread.  (Were they raised in another newsgroup
perhaps?)  Such as the "adverse" conditions, and the propriety of the
Lafferty match.  I didn't see anyone claim "adverse" conditions, nor did i
see anyone object to the Lafferty match.  You also wrote a lot about the
current match conditions, whereas (IF you read carefully) my original note
referred to the conditions of the PREVIOUS match being favorable to the
machine.  It looks to me like you're just trying to obfuscate the issue.

Unfortunately, there are some people who will argue their point forever

    No kidding.  Also there are people who think they can win a debate
without addressing the actual arguments made by the other side,
simply by calling the other side stupid or ignorant, or by inventing
and then pretending to refute arguments that the other side never made.

    Hey remember, i'm dealing with a dude who claimed the championship
when his opponent defaulted. (:-)  Or do you deny posting the following:

	``Chinook is now the "man-machine" world champion [...]''

After winning not one game.

Kindly make one last post (your last word on the

    I can see the world championship has gone to someone's head.
