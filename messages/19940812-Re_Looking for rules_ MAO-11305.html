I thought Mao was the game also known as Eleusis. It goes roughly like this.

Nope, I'm sorry, but Mao and Eleusis are not the same game.  They share a
similar spirit, namely that they involve the creative invention of rules
as the game progresses, but Mao is considerably nastier (and a lot more fun).
It is possibly the most interesting game I know, perhaps with the exception
of Nomic, which I have never actually played.

Hm...  I hesitate to post the rules of the game to a newsgroup.  I feel
hesitant to even say what they are to my own mother.  But I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>suppose<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>  that
if you wanted the rules, you could mail me.  My reasoning is that although
I violate a tenet of the game by writing down the rules, the spirit of Mao
benefits overall by having the game become more widespread.

So try mailing me and I'll see what I can do.  By the way - I'm moving over 
the next few days, so it may take some time for me to respond.
