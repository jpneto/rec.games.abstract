Three-move equalization is similar, but as you might imagine, it
involves the first player making not one move but three.  He makes one
move as White, one as Black, and then one more as White.  And again,
now the second player has the choice of either playing Black and
continuing the game from this point, or as White, and allowing his
opponent to choose his own second move as Black.

Aha!  I had always thought that 3-move equalization meant that the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>second<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player made black's first move, and I wondered what the point
was, since the second player could swap after sticking black with an
atrocious position.  Thanks for clarifying.

This also reminds me that Winning Ways actually has tic-tac-toe problems
(a la chess problems) that are actually a bit difficult.  These are
board positions that never arise in normal play from an empty board, but
now I wonder whether they could arise from a 3-move-swap opening.
