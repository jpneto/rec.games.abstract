Hello Cameron, good to hear from you. If "Stax" (great name, wonder
why nobody thought of it before!) is as good as its presentation,
we're in for a serious contender :) . I've yet to read the rules
carefully and let them sink in, but at first glance it has the feel of
a "chess-like Trax", though Trax of course has only placement.

Quote:
"The twelve pieces represent all symmetric arrangements of 0 to 6
pointers within six sides. There are another two asymmetric
arrangements of three pointers; these were not included for aesthetic
reasons and to keep the number of pieces managable."

Aestetics might reason towards completeness I feel, but the 'a-
symmetry' comes in handy as an argument against them and the
'managable number' may indeed enhance game play. I assume you've
tested that.

The complete set, including the two asymmetric 3's, is again a subset
of the "China Labyrinth" set:

I'm very happy to see such a renown designer take part, welcome :)
