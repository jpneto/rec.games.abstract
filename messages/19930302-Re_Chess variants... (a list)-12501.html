Okay - people have been talking about chess varients, so here are the
ones I know about and play frequently:

Monster: White sets up normaly, black sets up only his king and the four
center pawns (all one space ahead of normal).  Black can move twice for
each white move and blacks pawns cannot advance.  This is actually easier
for black - you try mating a king that can run two spaces!!  The setup
ends up like this.

			     White
			R N B K Q B N R
			P P P P P P P P
			- - - - - - - -
			- - - - - - - -
			- - - - - - - -
			- - P P P P - -
			- - - K - - - -
			- - - - - - - -
			     Black


Bug House: This varient requires two chess sets, and four players.  It starts
as if two games of chess were going to be played, but when a piece is captured,
you hand it to your teammate (so black on one board has to team with white
on the other)  On their move, they have the option of placing it on any open
space on the board.  If you play with clocks, they should typically be set
for about 3 min.  If not, moves should try to be made in under 5 sec, and
pieces cannot be placed on the board the same turn your partner gives them
to you.

Rebirth-Chess: This is a mix between Bug-House and regular chess.  It only
requires two players, and is played at a normal speed, but if a piece dies on
a space other then where it started, the player gets it back, and can use his
turn to put it back on its starting place.

Ultima-Chess: The setup for this game is only slightly altered from the classic
setup - the bishops and knights are reversed.  Each piece has their normal 
movements, as well as the movements of any (of your) pieces in the column
they start out with.  This makes for some very interesting strategic setups
to get the maximum power of the pieces, as well as when you move one piece
into a column to allow another piece to put the king in check - there are
endless posibilities.

Inverse-Ultima-Chess: This varient of Ultima chess (for those truely sadistic
among you) lets a piece have the power of the column it lands in, rather then
the one its from.  In other words, a pawn can shoot sideways across the board
into the rooks column.  It is insane trying to figure out what moves everything
has, and checkmate is especially dificult to be sure of!  Overall, I've had
fun times playing it, mostly because just how insane it is.

Well, thats about all I can think of for now.  If anyone else can add to the
list please do so because I'm always interested in finding new varients to
play.
