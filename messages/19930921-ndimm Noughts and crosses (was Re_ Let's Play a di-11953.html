Does anyone know if a draw is possible in 4^4 noughts and crosses?

Oops; I mustn't have thought very hard (it's been a while since I thought
about it), 'cause I came up with the following today..

So in more general terms, for what N and D can a draw be found,
and is it the same set as all values of (N,D) for which the
first player of an N^D noughts and crosses game cannot force a win?

I beleive the answer to the second question is yes, and my knowlege
of the first is as following:

(d indicates a draw possible,
 1 indicates the first player can always win and no draw is known possible
 D indicates a draw is possibel and a drawing strategy for the second
 player is known.)


\ D 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
N\_____________________________
1 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  ...
2 | 1 D 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  ...
3 | 1 D D 1 1 1 1 1 1  ...
4 | 1 D D d d
5 | 1 D D
8 | 1 D D
9 | 1 D D

    . . .
    . . .
    . . .


Is there a function F such that a draw can be found for
{(n,d) : 0&lt;n&lt;F(d) } ?

I think a sufficient but not necessary (eg 3^2) condition for
a draw to be possible is that there be at least twice as
many 'squares' (points in the game space) as winning runs,
ie

n^d &gt;=2*(  ((n+2)^d-n^d)/2)  )
