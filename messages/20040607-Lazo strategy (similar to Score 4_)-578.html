The discussion of the winning strategy for Score 4 reminded me of the
winning strategy for Lazo on a small grid. Score 4 is moderately
interesting, but if the main thing to go for right off the bat is to
outwait your opponent, and force him to play in a vulnerable spot, then
the game is just not very fast-paced in my opinion. I solved this problem
in Lazo (at least, I think i did) by increasing the size of the board.
See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/Lazo1.html">http://www.geocities.com/twixtplayer/Lazo1.html</a> for the rules to
the game. With a larger board, there is more room to generate threats,
and the game is usually over long before the board gets filled up.
At least, that has been my experience in limited playtesting. If you
have Zillions of Games, you can download my Lazo package which is called
"Loop Game" at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Loopgame.html">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Loopgame.html</a>
The generic Zillions engine actually plays the small board rather well,
and recognizes the importance of vulnerable spots. But it's easy to
defeat on the larger board with more direct threats.

Perhaps a game like Score 4 could benefit from a larger grid, also.
