I am unfamiliar with the term "block-diagonal".  Is this a standard
term?  I take it to mean that the grid can be divided into quadrants
     |
  A  | B
-----+---
  C  | D

such that there are no stones in quadrants B and C.  Then A and D are
independent games (which may be further segregated by this method).  Is
that correct, or are there other conditions?

I took the liberty to borrow the term 'block-diagonal' from matrix
theory. In above description it indeed means that there are no stones
in sections B and C (or, by symmetry, in sections A and D).

By the way, what I have not figured out yet whether any irreducible
configuration can be represented uniquely by the row and column sums.
(Torben has shown that reducible configurations cannot uniquely be
representaed as such, but I have not seen a counter-example for
irreducible configurations yet.)

So, for example:

 2 2 2 

(X X X)  3
(X X .)  2
(. . X)  1

is an irreducible configuration that (apart from irrelevant
symmetries) can be represented in a unique way by the row and column
sum:

(3 2 1, 2 2 2)

That means, given this 'sum-representation' (3 2 1, 2 2 2) one can
re-construct the following posible originating configurations:

(X X X)  (X X X)  (X X X)
(. X X)  (X . X)  (X X .)
(X . .)  (. X .)  (. . X)

which are clearly all equivalent to the given configuration. In fact,
the sum-representation (when ordered appropriately) nicely removes
irrelevant symmetries induced by row/column swapping.

But... can each irreducible configuration (with all its equivalent
configurations) be mapped onto one unique sum-representation?
