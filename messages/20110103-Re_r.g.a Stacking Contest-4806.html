Hey folks,

I'm back in Berlin.  Poland is also cold incase anyone was wondering.
I see there has been quite a bit of activity while I was away!  I
still have a bit of 'writers block', but with a spring deadline I'll
hopefully have some stuff to offer.

I'll look for Kris' email.  My boss has it if I don't.

I'm busy for the next couple of days (possibly weeks if I have to go
to Spain), but will be back on track soon for playtest and discussion.

....oh my goodness I'm in a contest with Cameron.  This is gonna be a
challenge for sure :D.

Welcome to the contest to everyone who's jumped aboard!

Daniel
