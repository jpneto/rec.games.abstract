You can try to implement the game rules in "Zillions of games".

Hmm... I hadn't heard of that program before.  It looks very
interesting!  Unfortunately, it's not open-source, nor even
freeware, and unlocking the ability to create new games costs
$25 plus time and hassle.  The rules language also looks fairly
clumsy, although I see lots of people have managed to do things
with it. ;-)

  One of the Zillions of Games FAQs
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/supportedFAQ.html">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/supportedFAQ.html</a>) says that
Zillions "doesn't currently support [...] pieces that occupy multiple
positions simultaneously," which sounds like they're saying that
Pentominoes-style games are intrinsically hard to program in
Zillions.

  If there exists a free/open equivalent of "Zillions of Games,"
I'd really like to hear of it.

I think

Yeah - two Pentominoes games turn up on Google, both by Karl
Scherer, and using what look like two slightly different approaches.
Both of them are in the "brute force" category, though, with
separate methods to manipulate each of the twelve pieces.  AFAICT
the brute force method is the state of the art in polyomino
programming.

As soon as you have created a "Zillion rule file" the program will start
to play the game and be a valuable opponent for beta testing.

As soon as I've figured out how to pay an online retailer $25
for the "full version," and written the rule file, the program
may start to play the game, and maybe it will become a decent
opponent.
  It sounds like the AI may actually be pretty good, although
(again) from the FAQ: "Zillions doesn't play as well in games
with huge branching factors[.]"  I don't know what's considered
a "huge branching factor", but I guess if it can play chess
decently, Capture Pentominoes shouldn't be much of a challenge.
