So you potentially cause a person you are in dispute with to lose his
job or at the very least, have his job placed in jeopardy? You call that
a proportionate response? It would fit in with your extreme views about
what you think abstract games should be like. Unfortunately, much as you
may like it, mucking around with people's lives in such an extreme
manner is not a game. You clearly are either deeply deluded, deeply
unpleasant, or both. I hope it is the first.

into you.? (Friedrich Nietzsche)

Both sides should take note.

lol don't worry Zhang, I made sure the head of the math department
knows that Mark Steere is not a trustworthy person and his interests
are not to be defended and I really doubt anyone could give a shit
about this in the first place. In fact, I suspect Mark has just been
conjuring these email responses out of thin air.
