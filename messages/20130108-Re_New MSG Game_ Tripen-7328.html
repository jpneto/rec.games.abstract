You analyzed the shit out of it but you didn't play the shit out of it.  The one time I played you, I blundered, giving away a 6, and I was still able to turn the game around and win.

That isn't true.  Cephalopod is a fairly ordinary game in which experience and skill directly effect one's chances of winning.

It is also the epitome of a game suffering from paradraws. That is the

I'm still not buying into this bizarre paradraw shit.  Why does a board with an odd number of spaces have an "extra space"?  Is there some unwritten presumption that a board should have an even number of spaces?  Does Go have an "extra" point?  You'd still be able to win at Cephalopod on an even board.  You'd just have to win by two.

Cephalopod really is just a glorified Nim.

If it were Nim, there'd be a system for winning, which you obviously haven't discovered.
