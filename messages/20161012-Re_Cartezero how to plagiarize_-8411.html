No Hazen, I don't want you to die anytime soon. Like the other life cultists, I would rather have your cycle of addiction carry on into perpetuity until you all realize what the only viable teleology for humanity is. As for me; I plan to do the sensible thing and commit suicide just as soon as I can subvert the implacable Will to Live so that I no longer have to put up with gibbering idiots like yourself for decades to come or witness the fallout of a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton regime. Besides that, before I go I'll release my backlog of games which would be a far more legitimate legacy than trying to make excuses for the perpetuation of my genetic material through the imposition of sentience on my replacement shitters and the attendant mundane horrors of human experience.

Crappy game designer legacy???
Legacy of what? A long sequence of botched copy-pasted games.
One day I will tell what is the game design and what are the secrets of any creation in any field (art,maths, literature and so on).
In the year 2100 or maybe before robots will create an infinite number of art works never seen before, games never seen before, novels poems never seen before, canvas and sculptures never seen before, architecture design never seen before ....
So even if you create really good games (which is impossible in regard with your low level and your dumbness) all your legacy will be thrown to the garbage. 
You know why? Go sell peanuts with your friend Luis and leave the design game to me or the real game designer not bunch of plagiarists like you and Luis.
