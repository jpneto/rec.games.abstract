Yes.  That was the idea back in 1998, back in the dark days after
Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue.  I had the notion that it would be an
interesting challenge to devise a game that was simpler than chess
(not a hard criterion to satisfy) yet more resistant to computer
analysis.  My idea was that a game in which players constructed their
own pieces and continually chose whether to improve or move them might
do the trick.  The jury, of course, is still out.

I also was inspired by the G.K. - D.B. match to see if there could
be a game that would be difficult for computers to play and still be
easy for humans. See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/</a> for more info.

Unlike OCTI I did not start from scratch and limited myself to find 
such a game using only the material available in a standard chess set. 
Thus people can play it without needing to buy anything. It took me 
much longer to finalize the rules of Arimaa than it did for you to 
finalize the rules of OCTI. Probably since I had more constraints :-)

You have given me the idea that we should formalize a human vs. robot
competition, just for fun.

Yes, that would be a good way to gauge how far the programs have
improved. In fact after creating Arimaa I put out a challenge for 
the AI community with a $10,000 reward. 
See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/">http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/</a> for more info.

You might also want to consider offering a reward. If you make
it large enough you will get some world class game developers
writting bots for your game :-).

BTW: I've played OCTI many times as osyed before it was moved
to the new server. It's a fun game. I'd like to try playing
the 3 base standard version against the computer, but could
not find how to get it to join such a game.

You should try a few games of Arimaa sometimes :-)
