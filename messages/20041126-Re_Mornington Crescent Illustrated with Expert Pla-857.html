I'm pretty sure Mornington Crescent was solved in the early 1960s.  Was it
Minski?

I do believe you are thinking of the American Standard Imperial Variation
which was popular in New York Clubs in the 1930s and 1940s.  After the
Second World War it lost ground to other variations because of its limited
possibilities.  The weakness of this Variation was indeed confirmed by
Minski solving it in 1964, as part of a post-graduate research project.  Not
surprisingly, "The Mornington Crescent Compendium" does not regard the
American Standard Imperial Variation as an official version of Mornington
Crescent, and it is widely perceived to be an inferior mutation of the
traditional game.
