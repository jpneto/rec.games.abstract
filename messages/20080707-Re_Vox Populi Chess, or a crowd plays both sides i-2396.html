If the goal is finding the person in the audience with the most skill,

As I see it, if one person is left and he wins, then he should be the
winner, if he didn't defect.  I am not sure the skill will be best
chess player, but competent chess player who can best assess the teams
and the positions on the board.  My goal for this is not necessarily
to find the member of the crowd that is the best player, but have an
intriguing form of chess (or other game) that will draw people in to
want to play.  No guarantee of optimal play either developing.  You
just want INTERESTING play.

I suggest this as a measure of an audience member's score, added for
each move: The total number of people you managed to tempt over to
your side, divided by the the number of people already on your side.
The switching player also loses one point. This keeps the game zero-
sum, which is a very good idea.

For the sake of balancing purpose, I am considering having an added
costs to switching to a side with more players on it.  This could also
happen in the beginning regarding the seating of players.  I believe
what you ideally want it the teams to be balanced for as long as
possible, until there is a "crash" that happens where one side's
position is royally messed up, then a mass defect where the game ends.

If all players end up on one side, the game is obviously over and you
just calculate the winner among the audience. If the game ends in
checkmate (pretty unlikely, I'd think), consider all members on the
losing team as having switched to the winning.

There is an issue regarding if the position would likely be a draw
that needs to be dealt with.  Dealing with it properly is the best way
and strongest solution.  Of course, games without draws don't need to
worry.  By the way, thanks for the complement in the other post.
