I think definitely not.  This is in fact exactly the misconception that
cost Kasparov the match against Deep Blue.  He convinced himself that he
could understand what computers "can do" and "can't do", and prepared
and played accordingly.  The first cost of this approach was inadequate
preparation.  The more significant cost was that, when the computer
played better than he expected, he became "surprised" in the way that
you describe, so "surprised" that he became unhinged from the pressure,
distracted by theories that the IBM team must have cheated since the
computer did that which computers "aren't supposed to be able to do",
and ultimately lost his concentration on the actual match and blundered
in the decisive game.

In my personal experience, few of the people observing the match, among
computer professionals, shared this misconception that there are things
that "computers aren't supposed to be able to do".  We would have been
surprised if the much greater resources put into Deep Blue than into
previous chess computer players had <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> produced substantially better
results.  Rather than the reverse, of expecting there to be things that
"computers aren't supposed to be able to do" regardless of the resources
invested in them.

There doesn't seem to be much point in continuing this any further

As you like.  I'll post when I have things to say.
