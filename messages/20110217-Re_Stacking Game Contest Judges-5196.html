Whoops. But I do think I remeber a post a while back where you
expressed that his oversight of your games was deliberate.

It would be hard for someone in Dave's line of interest to oversee my
work. Not implementing any of my games was no doubt deliberate - one
don't choose games for publication randomly. So he will have had his
reasons, but I doubt if these included any personal feelings. I'm not
the only inventor around and there are a lot of games worthy of
attention piling up on his desk, I presume.

As I said, I consider his reasons implicitly deliberate, and I respect
them as such. I can't remember ever making a fuzz about it, and with
the audience paying such immaculate attention, I obviously don't have
to ;-)
