Box Off is a solitaire game, so technically this post is off topic.  2-Player perfect information game purists will want to read no further.  Here are the rules:

The standard size for it is 8x6, and the standard number of different kinds of tiles is 3 --- black, white and yellow.  A different size can be used (for instance, 10x8), and also a different number of kinds of tiles can be used (for instance, 4 different kinds of tiles --- black, white, yellow and green.


Tiles are randomly laid out on the board to start the game.  The object is to clear all the tiles off the board.  Two same-colored tiles can be removed if they share an otherwise empty rectangle.  Here are some examples on a 4x4 board:


_ _ _ _
_ b b _
_ _ _ _
_ _ _ _


In the above diagram, the two black tiles can be removed because they form a 2x1 rectangle.


_ _ _ _
w _ _ _
_ _ _ _
w _ _ _


In the above diagram, the two white tiles may be removed because they form the ends of an otherwise empty 1x3 rectangle.  (If there were a tile between them --- including a white tile --- they could not be removed.)


_ _ _ y
_ _ _ _
_ _ _ _
_ y _ _


In the above diagram, the two yellow tiles may be removed because they form the corners of an otherwise empty 3x4 rectangle.  If there were any other tiles within that rectangle --- including yellow tiles --- they could not be removed.


Here's an example game on a 6x3 board:


b b w b b w
b y y y w b
y w w w y y


The two white tiles at b1 and c1 are removed:


b b w y y w
b y y y w b
y _ _ w y y


Then the two black tiles at a2 and a3 are removed:


_ b w b b w
_ y y y w b
y _ _ w y y


Then the two yellow tiles at a1 and b2 are removed:


_ b w b b w
_ _ y y w b
_ _ _ w y y


Then the two yellow tiles at c2 and d2 are removed:


_ b w b b w
_ _ _ _ w b
_ _ _ w y y


Then the two black tiles at d3 and e3 are removed:


_ b w _ _ w
_ _ _ _ w b
_ _ _ w y y


Then the two white tiles at c3 and d1 are removed:


_ b _ _ _ w
_ _ _ _ w b
_ _ _ _ y y


Then the two yellow tiles at e1 and f1 are removed:


_ b _ _ _ w
_ _ _ _ w b
_ _ _ _ _ _


At this point nothing else can be done.  The remaining black an white tiles interfere with each other.  But the initial position could have been solved, had not a mistake been made.  Do you see the mistake?
