On the larger boards (and to some extent on the 6x9 board), there are too many possibilities to read out the puzzle all the way.  Intuition and probabilistic thinking must be used.  Here are some basic strategies:

--- Identify the most problematic clusters, especially those in the corner and on the sides.  Don't wait to start resolving these clusters, or you'll find yourself out of matching options later.  But be careful not to overcommit; remove no more pairs than seem necessary to resolve the worst areas or, once again, you'll find yourself without enough matching options later.

--- Be aware when the number of pieces of a certain color is getting low relative to the number of pieces of the other colors.  The fewer pieces there are of a particular color, the less matching options there will be to remove them.

---  Be mindful of colors that are scattered very unevenly.  For instance, suppose you're playing the 6x9 board on regular difficulty, and there are 18 pieces of each color in the initial setup.  But you notice that the distribution of blue pieces is quite uneven:  there are three blue pieces near the lower right corner that are significantly isolated from the other fifteen.  It is dangerous to wait too long to start planning the removal of these three pieces.
