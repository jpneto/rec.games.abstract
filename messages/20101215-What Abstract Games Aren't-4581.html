Abstract games are not hidden information games or simultaneous move games.
They aren't Poker, they aren't Matching Pennies, and they aren't any sort of
mathematical recreation, matrix games involving two players simultaneously
choosing a row and a column respectively.

The term "abstract games" has a meaning.  Something other than games that
are abstract.  Every game is abstract.  Stones and a board with a grid drawn
on it most certainly do not preclude a game from being abstract.

If mathematical recreation games need to be discussed here, I actually don't
see any harm in that.  It's not like we can't spare the bandwidth.

I can't argue that math recreation is interrupting something more relevant
here, not with professor Billshit trying to shut down the group with spam
attacks and complaining about abstract games and their designers.  Not to
mention professor Bushit, a fake Chinese guy, who's really German
apparently, here to vouch for professor Billshit.

It's a crime that these two integrity challenged clowns have been placed in
positions of responsiblitly with the malleable young minds of students.
