Oops!  Niel Gall asked about Nim, and his message ended:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 Two players take it in turns to remove any number of stones
 from a single row.  The player to remove the last stone loses.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As someone pointed out to me, I blithely went ahead and described
normal Nim, where the player taking the last stone <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>wins<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

The spiffy algorithm for Nim that I posted was "leave the piles so
that when you xor their sizes (written in binary) together, you get
zero."  Fortunately, this version ("Mise`re Nim") isn't much harder to
play.

The question is, when are Nim and M-Nim different?  Well, the first
obvious case is when there's only one pile left, and it has one stone
in it.  Then you win if you're playing Nim, and lose if you're playing
M-Nim.  The same thing happens any time all the piles left have only
one stone: if the number of piles is odd, you win Nim but lose M-Nim;
if the number of piles is even, vice versa.

The next step is convincing yourself that that is basically the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>only<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
case where to two games are different.  You see, if <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> pile has
more than one thing in it, at some point during the game someone will
have to make a move to reduce that pile to either 0 or 1 stone.  So
cut to the end of the game, where there's only <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> pile left with
more than 1 stone in it.

If you were playing the "win at Nim" strategy, then when you get there
is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>has<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be your turn, because when you xor a bigger-than-1 number
together with a lot of 1's, you get something non-zero.  (The key to
winning at nim is that the xor is 0 at the end of your turn, and never
0 at the beginning of your turn.)  So if you use the "win at Nim"
strategy, you eventually get to the case where the xor is nonzero, it's
your move, and only one pile has more than one thing in it.  When that
happens, your Nim-move would have been to reduce that one big pile to
either 0 or 1 (since that's the only way to get 0 as the xor).  So your
M-Nim move should be the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>other<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one, becase once all remaining piles
have 1 stone, we know Nim and M-Nim are exactly opposite.

I guess it's kind of interesting that this means you don't need to know
which verison you're playing until near the end-- once all the piles
have 1 stone in them, it's really a pretty stupid game, and for
anything more complicated, the same strategy works in both cases.
