We already have 63.4% of games ending in a win by one player or the

That would shift the points balance towards Black: White would score
51.4% and Black 48.6%.  Of course, in practice, the distribution of
wins and draws would change, too.

Indeed, this is something that worries me a great deal about plans to
change the scoring of draws.  Schemes where the sum of the two
players' scores in a draw is less than that in a win have problems
associated with the game no longer being zero-sum and increasing the
profit of cheating.  Schemes that keep draws worth one point in total
but give more of that point to one side or the other seem to increase
the temptation for the player who gets more points (usually Black) to
play for the draw.  This would be the case particularly in schemes
where Black gets more than about 73% of the point, as, then, Black
would be getting more than half of his score from draws, at the
current rates of draws.

Yes, the results are clearly different at different strengths.  Among
beginners, hardly any games are drawn; among the very top players,
well over half of the games are drawn.

e) Given the introduction of computers and also the net as means of
researching opponents games, I also wonder if the top 1% of players
now have a different W : D : L ratio than, say, the generation

Perhaps, yes.
