One die would have a range (say 0-4) and the other one would have a

What does a d5 look like?

A triangular prism.  If it's too long and narrow, you don't roll the
ends enough, and if it's too short and wide, you don't roll the sides
enough; but there's an aspect ratio where all 5 sides are equally
likely.

Alternatively, a pentagonal prism with rounded or pointed ends so that
they can't be rolled at all.


Any way of getting an even distribution of 1-10 using 2d6 is going to
have to include some results of "reroll", because 10 is not a divisor
of 36.

It really helps if the dice are different, or you roll them one at a
time.

But it's easier to use 1d10 - it's a d12 with two opposite faces
converted into pointed ends that can't be rolled.  This works out so
that all ten faces are congruent.  You can probably get them at game
stores - a lot of RPGs use them, often in pairs to get a 1-100 result.
