I am looking at starting an alt.games.othello, though a few suggested a 
rec.games.othello.  For this to work, I need to know if anyone here would 
care about such a group, and if they think the trademarked name of 
"Othello" could be a problems (reversi is so boring).

Igor Durdanovic (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:igor@uni-paderborn.de">igor@uni-paderborn.de</a>) had already started a RFD for 
rec.games.othello.  However, I think it was nuked to do insufficient
activity.  

IMHO, I don't think there is enough net-traffic to warrant a separate
sub-group for the game of Othello.  Othello is covered by the charter of 
rec.games.abstract ... why don't we use it?

Good call, Mark. However, as I asked around the net, from newsgroups to 
mailing lists to notes in email boxes around the world, from over 25 
responses, 1 person said "try games.abstract, I guess it fits there."  
Many games are covered under this charter, but the name does not invite 
anyone in, like go or chess or backgammon.  With an othello group, it 
becomes entirely clear what the group is about, specific instead of, dare 
I say it, abstract.

My goals
1)  FAQ.
2)  Sources of good ai othello code
3)  Locations of various othello implementations, and some rankings
4)  Sharing of strategy, tactics, and rules variations
5)  Tourneys, awareness, and fun
6)  to get my name in lights... Oops, sorry, got carried away...

So, if abstract can attract people to do this, great.  But if it took me 
this long to find out about this, I wonder about the casual person who 
searches for groups and finds chess and backgammon, but then can't figure 
out where to look for advice on how to take corners (or whether corners 
are always such a great move!).

Just an idea, if its been done before, no biggie.  One adv of alt 
hierarchy is that its less "voting" required, I think.  A better 
"stumbleonit" quotient...

Thanks for the note....

Michael
