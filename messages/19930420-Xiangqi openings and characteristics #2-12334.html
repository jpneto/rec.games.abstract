In my first posting, I have introduced the most commonly encountered
openings and structures. In this posting, I shall give some openings and
examples of when we can switch from 1 structure to another.

Example 1

Central cannon vs Wind-screen Horse

1  C25   H8+7
2  H2+3  R98
3  R12   S7+1
4  R2+6  H2+3
5  S7+1  C89
6  R23   C9-1
7  H8+7  C97
8  R34   A4+5
9  H7+6  E3+5 (See diagram)

     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

     r . . . g a e r .
     . . . |\a/| c . .    
     . c h |/e\| h . .  Black
     s . s . s R . . s
     ------------s----
     ----S-H----------
     S . . . S . S . S
     . C . |\C/| H . .  Red                
     . . . |/|\| . . .
     R . E A G A E . .

     9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

This is the most common of the central cannon vs windscreen Horse variation.
Red started out by getting the major pieces into play quickly. Black do
likewise by consolidating its defence.

In move #9, if Black play 9  ...   R8+5;  C8+2  S3+1?; H6+5 R83;  C89! Black
is in danger of losing a piece.

10  C56   Red central cannon shifts to 6th rank because Black has already
consolidated its defence. Likewise, Red must try its attack on the flanks
rather than from the centre of the board. It does this by transforming the
central cannon structure to a cross-court cannon structure.

10  ...    R8+5
11  C8+2   S3+1
12  S3+1   R8-1  the correct choice. If Black plays R87?; E7+5 R7+1; C8-1
Black rook is captured.

The variations from here onwards is rather complex and will not be analysed
here. The main point is I introduce the transformation from one structure to
another according to the needs of the game plan.

Of course, in move #10, Red can also play:

10  C87   R8+5
11  S3+1  R87
12  H3+4  R7+4
13  C53  ... Black 7th Horse is under threat. In this situation, Red changes
from central cannon to the balance cannon structure to attack Black from the
wings.


But let me give another example where some readers here may find more
familiar:

Example 2
1  C25   C85
2  H2+3  H8+7
3  R12   R9+1
4  H8+7  R94
5  S3+1  H2+3
6  S7+1  R4+5
7  C54  (See diagram)

     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

     r . e a g a e . .
     . . . |\|/| . . .    
     . c h |/c\| h . .  Black
     s . s . s . s . s
     -----------------
     ----S-------S----
     S . . r S . . . S
     . C H |\|/C H . .  Red                
     . . . |/|\| . . .
     R . E A G A E R .

     9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Here, Red started out with central cannon but as the game progresses,
switches to the Sandwiched Horse to consolidate its defences.

7  ...    R43
8  E7+5   S5+1
9  A6+5   R1+1

Black started out with Same Direction Cannon but now changes to the central 
cannon S5+1 variation as the game develops.

I shall not analyse the moves further. Interested readers may post further
analysis to the group :)
