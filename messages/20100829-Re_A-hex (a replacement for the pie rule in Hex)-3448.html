The guy is literally stalking me at this point.  For the past few
days, every time I opened a new game on iggc, this clown, known as
Liberte on iggc, jumped in and sat down.  When I would exit the game
and open a new one he'd exit and join the new one too, basically
preventing me from ever playing anyone but him.  I finally had to ask
Arty to intervene.

In all seriousness, I believe this guy is a true, textbook
psychopath.  He's skilled at behaving normally to the extent that, if
he isn't obsessed with you, you probably won't notice anything.

Mark I was just trying to get 1 game. Everything was going good and
then one day, Blammo! Mark Steere is pissed off at me again. And I'm
not even sure why. To be honest Mark, Hex Oust is quickly becoming my
favorite game. How awkward is it for me to look at Mark Steere as a
source of inspiration, when the guy hates my guts? It's ridiculous
Mark. I'm trying to stay on your good side, and I can tell you, it
hasn't been easy. I haven't stalked shit either. I'm on iggc most days
whether you're there or not. As for chasing you around, I wasn't sure
why you had abandoned the room in the first place. We'd chatted the
previous day and it seemed to me like this nonsense was over and done
with. Even a nice "fuck off" would've helped me understand what was
going on. And I certainly didn't find out about M-torus from my
stalking efforts which have amounted to using a few of the same sites
as you. I just stumbled upon it while looking at the ENTIRE HISTORY of
this site (including various reports from a man claiming to be
conspired against by MI-5) You see, I have that kind of time
unfortunately. Jesus Mark you whine and complain about how nobody
knows about your games and then you have a guy who is very interested
in your work and you accuse him of stalking you? I don't know one
single piece of private information about you pal. How's that for
stalking? I think this transcends a simple internet dispute. This is
probably just one chapter in an absurdist saga of Mark Steere vs.
himself.
