Justice is the game that's more similar to Nim.
With an even number of plates, I think that it
yields to the same analysis as Nim. This is
because every losing position (equal stones on
all plates) is a first-player loss in Nim.

I think that you also mean, and rightly so,
that any "equal stones on all plates" position
is a first player loss also in "justice".

Furthermore. Let the plates be split into
pairs of plates, where withing each pair
the two plates have the same number of stones
on them (it may be different number for different
pairs). Then the player on the move is lost--
whatever s/he will do with a plate, the other
player will do  the same with the other plate
of the same pair.

The case of 3 plates seems to be already difficult,
both for justice and for injustice.

Actually, in this position (an odd number of plates,
with n&gt;0 stones on each), the winning mov  for Nim
and fo "justice" is the same: remove all stones
from one plate. Now and on, that you have 0 stones
on one of the plates, this is exactly like Nim.

Thank you, Chrostopher, regards everybody,
