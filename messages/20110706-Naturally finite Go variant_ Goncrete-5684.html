I've long been trying to come up with an elegant, simple set of rules
which succeeded in making Go into a naturally finite game, without the
need for superko rules. That hypothetical game would no longer be Go,
of course, but it should feel as close to Go as possible and preserve
most of its virtues.

Till now, my only (published) attempt at this particular task was
Paper and Pencil Go (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?PaperAndPencilGo">http://senseis.xmp.net/?PaperAndPencilGo</a>), which
was interesting but still far from ideal, as making life was too easy.

Now I'm presenting Goncrete, which is a much more balanced game and,
hopefully, closer to Go in its play.



GONCRETE
------------------

The rules are those of Go, with the following exceptions:

a) When one player makes a capture, all the surrounded enemy groups
are flipped (i.e. converted to the player's color). Then, the player
must remove one stone from as many of the groups just flipped as
possible without splitting the newly formed group.

b) The game ends when both players pass in succession or when one
player loses all his stones as a result of a capture.

c) Suicide is illegal.

d) Area scoring is used.


Sample positions:
-------------------------

A Goncrete board should be much larger than the tiny ones shown here.
'A' represents White's next move. You'll probably have to paste this
section into Notepad to make the diagrams look right.

.. A . .        . o . .
o x o .   -&gt;   o o o .
.. o . x        . o . x

In this case, the single flipped stone can't be removed, because that
would split the new White group into four groups.

--

.. o o . o o . x        . o o . o o . x        . o o . o o . x
o x x A x x o .   -&gt;   o o o o o o o .   -&gt;   o . o o o o o .
o o o . o o . .        o o o . o o . .        o o o . o o . .

In this case, the group on the left allows the removal of one stone
without splitting the newly formed group, but the one on the right
does not. Please note that such removals, when possible, are
mandatory.

--

.. o A . x        . o o . x        . o o . x
o x x o .   -&gt;   o o o o .   -&gt;   o . o o .
o o x o .        o o o o .        o o o o .
.. o o . .        . o o . .        . o o . .

Here, any of the three flipped stones can be removed. In such cases,
the result will be exactly the same no matter which stone you choose.

--

x x x        o o o        o o o
x x x   -&gt;   o o o   -&gt;   o . o
x A o        o o o        o o o

White's last placement ends the game, as all the Black stones have
been captured. If the game were allowed to continue, an endless series
of captures and recaptures would take place. Allowing suicide would
cause a similar problem.
