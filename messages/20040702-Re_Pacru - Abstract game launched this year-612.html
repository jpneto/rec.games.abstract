Okay, I went to the website and played a game.  My first impressions were
mixed.  At first play, it doesn't appear that there's enough interaction
between the players -- it feels like each side is maneuvering its pieces with
little regard for what the other player is doing.  The game develops slowly. 
Eventually, you reach a position where your tiles start to affect what the
other player can do.  But I still find that there's not enough choices.  The
game plays, to my mind, like a constricted version of Amazons, but is not as
good as Amazons.  Of course, this is after only one  playing.
