I'm trying to find a copy of a game I played a few
weeks ago.

Each player has four balls/globes (the ones I
used were about an inch in diameter and had chimes
in them) and the game is played on a four-by-four
grid. The goal is to end up with your pieces either
lined up, in a two-by-two square, or in the four
corners.

The game had an oriental-sounding name which
started with a 'Q' (I think). One set of balls
was silver, the other set was blue with Chinese
symbols.

Any idea what this game is? And, even better,
who made it and sells it?

Thanks,
Peter B.
