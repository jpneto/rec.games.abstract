In designing patterns for my game Mind Ninja (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.mindninja.com">www.mindninja.com</a>), I've
come across a type of win condition that I particularly love: parity
conditions, where one player wins when there is an odd number of
something on the board, and the other wins when there is an even
number.  I bring it up here because I don't see the concept used very
much, but it can be applied in many ways and generally leads to games
with absolutely fascinating tactics and strategy. Note that in Mind
Ninja, each player can play <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> color stone he wants on his turn,
and that may part of the reason that these parity conditions turn out
to be so cool in Mind Ninja.  In any case, below I've provided four
example Mind Ninja patterns that involve parity; I want to see what
you brilliant game designers can come up with, if you're inclined.

(In all the pattern descriptions below, the word "group" refers to a
connected group of like-colored stones on the board.  The first one
below is probably my favorite of all Mind Ninja patterns.)

OddGroup
The board must be completely full of stones, and there must be an odd
number of groups consisting of at least X stones.  (the pattern
chooser specifies X when proposing the pattern.  Somewhere around 7-9
seems ideal on a standard Mind Ninja HexHex board).  When counting
groups, sum over groups of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>both<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> colors.

OddEdge I
The board must be completely full of stones, and the group of stones
that touches the highest number of board-edges must touch an odd
number of board edges.  If there is more than one group that touches
that number of board edges, that number must still be odd.  The color
of the group doesn't matter. Even a single stone counts as group.
Stones in corner spaces touch 2 edges.

OddEdge II
The board must be completely full of stones, and an odd number of
groups must touch the edges. When counting groups, sum up over groups
of both colors. Even a single isolated stone counts as a group.

OddGlom
The board must be completely full of stones, and an odd number of red
groups must touch the largest blue group. If there's more than one
largest blue group, add up the total number of red groups in contact
with at least one of them. Even a single stone counts as a group.
