I'm happy with the standard win/lose probability model as 
used by, for instance, Elo ratings, namely:

P(Ra beats Rb) = 1/(1+10^((Rb-Ra)/400))

However, that seems to only apply to P(draw) = 0.

How is one supposed to estimate the probability of a draw between
players of ratings Ra and Rb?

I presume that there might well be a magic constant dependent on
the game in question which indicates the likelyhood of draws in 
that particular game. (Chess relatively high, Twixt low, Hex zero).

The fact that a believer is happier than a sceptic is no more to the 
point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. 
The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.
