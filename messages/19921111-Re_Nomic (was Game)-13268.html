I've never played by Hofstadter's rules but I have played several
times using home-brewed rules.  We started off playing a simple card
game.  Each time a player won a round he was able to propose a rule
change.  That got a bit silly until someone changed the rule-changing
rule so that all other players proposed rule changes and the winner
chose which one would become law.  That worked very well.  We evolved
such a fun card game that on subsequent occasions we just played the
game with no changes.  The best rule we came up with was this: When
you play a heart you say "throb, throb, throb", when you play a club
you say "bonk, bonk, bonk", when you play a diamond you say "twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle" and when you play a spade you say "dig, dig, dig".
You can tell what sort of mentality the players had!

Indeed, it's great fun to play that sort of game.  I've played similar games
using Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, etc., as the basis for changing rules.

In a similar vein, has anyone out there ever heard of a game I know as 
Chairman Mouw(sp?)? (probably not the right name).
It goes like this: One player (Chairman Mouw) invents some rules, trying to be
as original,
interesting, and crazy as possible, based on a deck of cards.  These rules he
keeps as a secret known only to himself.  The winner is
the first person to get rid of all his/her cards. 

Standard rules for every game are:
1. You may play a card, if it is legal according to the rules Mouw makes.
Also, you must play it in the manner Mouw specifies in the rules.
Also it must be your turn. (you might not always be sure).

2. If you play a card wrongly, you must keep your card, and the Chairman must
explain why it is wrong, but not give away the rule (i.e. be cryptic about it).

3. If the Chairman's rules specify for something to happen, it must be done.

4. If you ask a question, you get a card. (A great way to get bystanders 
involved in your game. :-)

5. If you discuss the rules, you get a card. (More spectators joining?) 
Sometimes a confused player may find this necessary in order to make
any progress.

6. If the Chairman gets his/her rules mixed up, he/she gets a card. (this
happens often).

7. This is supposed to be a social game (no international Chairmen 
competitions), so have fun.
