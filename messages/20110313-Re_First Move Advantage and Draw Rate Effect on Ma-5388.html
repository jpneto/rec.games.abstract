You'd only need to play a perfect, finite-decisive game once.  Playing it
two or more times only serves to introduce draws into the match.  One play
would be ideal even for a nearly perfect game.  Oust is about as close to
"mythically perfect" as a game can be.

To be honest, I didn't follow all of your argument either on a literal level
or a mathematical one.  It seems like a potentially interesting topic
though, and I don't want it to die on the vine, so I'll attempt to respond
with a non-negative level of intelligence.  The math guys could jump in here
but this isn't an "approved topic", lol  What a bunch of wusses.

I think what you're trying to say is:

"First move advantage, even a fairly strong first move advantage, is really
no big deal in match play because all you have to do is play the game enough
extra times to reduce the draw rate to an acceptable level."

That's a pretty big "all you have to do is".  The consequences of having a
draw now are even more dire than ever since you've spent the whole fucking
day playing "sufficient games to avoid a draw" only to end up having a draw
anyway.  Winning!  Not.
