Some stone placement games with passing option can be easily made
drawless with the following obvious rule: in case of a tie, the player
who passed first wins. Of course, the suitability of this rule depends
on some features of the game, e.g. whether the length of the game and
the number of moves per turn are fixed or not.

Christian, I was just wondering why you decided not to implement this
rule in Sygo, as it seems to fit this particular game like a glove.
Thanks to the highly variable number of stones placed on each turn,
both players would have equal chances of ending up passing first, so
the game would still be perfectly balanced for both sides.

And it's a fair rule, as it rewards the player who spent the least
moves to score the same points.

Sygo is already a great game, but why not make it a great drawless
game? Just a suggestion :-)
