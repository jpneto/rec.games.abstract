I skimmed the rules and had several questions.  (I also did a double-take
on the "10x8 square board", though I quickly realised you meant a 10x8
board in which each space is a square. :-)

The example in figure 5 might warrant a note reminding that the move must
leave the white pieces connected.

I gather from figure 6 that the ordo move is more limited than the
description makes it sound: pieces connected in a horizontal line may
only move vertically (and still only forward), and pieces connected
vertically may only move horizontally.  Otherwise the vertically
connected pair on the right could be extended into a threesome and
all three could then shift up one space.  (There'd also be a move by
the horizontal pair just below the vertical pair, which could shift
left one space.)  Figure 8 seems to say this also, but again, it says
"pieces may only move sideways" where the text above says "they may
[move] forward or sideways", and nowhere does it come out and say that
horizontal sets move only forward while vertical sets move only sideways.

Anyway, it is, as my gaming group likes to say, "not obviously a silly
game", so I'll probably try it sometime.  Thanks!
