   Anyone looked over the Games top 100 games of the year yet? A
number
of the games in the Abstract section look very cool, but I'd like some
recommendations before buying any of them... Here's some I'm
interested
in:
 
Terrace - looks and sounds cool. I really like Abalone, and this
  seems very similar. Anyone play it? :D
 
Quadrature - Looks interesting... Anyone?
 
Omnigon - The description sounds very cool, with no picture shown. I
   hope someone can tell me more about this one... 
 
Kinesis - Looks a little silly, but could surprise me... 
 
Batalo - This one looks neat and sounds neat, but something about it
  makes me think it's not too cool. I just don't know why I feel that 
  way... I hope someone can talk some about this one too. :)
 
Slide 5 - Looks like a funner Connect 4. :)
 
Octiles - Looks neat, but far to expensive... No matter how good it 
  is, I'd have to play it first.
 
Quintillions - In the list for 7 years. Based on Pentominoes from 
  Clarke's book. Isn't there an actuly "Pentominoes" game? If so, is
  this better? Either way, how fun IS this game??
 
Connections - This is just Twixt, right?
 
Shuttles - Looks silly, but lowcost at $15. Fun?
 
Traverse - Sounds neat, but no picture. Anyone? Anyone?
 
 
 Thanks for any recommendations. I play Chess, Go, Abalone, Pente,
Connet Four, and a few other abstract games, but I'd like
to get into some newer games that are more unique. :)
