The answer to the question is practically held within the question itself.
Chaos (in the mathematical sense, not the gaming sense) doesn't necessarily
come from randomness.  It emerges from iterative systems that feed back upon
themselves.  Small differences in the initial conditions of a chaotic system
will cause larger and larger differences with each iteration of the system.

We can readily see this happening in Puerto Rico.  If two players (in a
four-player game) opt to build quarries early on, this will result in a
hugely different game from one in which only one player is aggressively does
so:  buildings will be less expensive for two players, and will thus come
into play faster, but fewer goods will be produced, raising the likelihood
that the other players will be able to sell their goods or ship them for
VPs.  This will act as a tropism for the other players; they'll tend to
behave differently than they would have behaved if there was less certainty
or profit to their actions.  And those different actions will affect what
happens subsequently.

In other words, "the butterfly effect", which consists of small
changes in the game having a large impact.  For me, good games have
this.  Players should impact the gaming system, and the result should
be dynamic gameplay.  Often times, to get this effect, luck elements
are introduced.  This, for me, is a cheap way out to get the desired
effect.
