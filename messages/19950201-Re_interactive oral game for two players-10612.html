Based on early feedback, I need to extend my initial information about the kind
of game my professor is looking for:

The focus of the game should be the interaction; fairly complex speech interaction
not requiring any special knowledge in any particular field.  The phenomenon he
is studying is the migration of two speakers (as in an interview situation) toward
certain "rituals" in their speech.  He'd like to use a game for his next study to
make the interaction more spontaneous than role-playing an "interview."  The subjects
will be graduate students, and they will be in separate, isolated rooms with head-
phones and microphones.

Dr. Randall Gregory, my professor, has been studying a certain set of rituals for
years, and he would like to see how the play of the game changes when these 
rituals are "filtered" out of the communication from the first player to the second,
while sending the full speech to the first player from the second.

We are having trouble coming up with a game that is more than trivial and uninteresting
but a game that can be played with little setup or instruction.

Thanks,
