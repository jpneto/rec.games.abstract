But what if you put the person on an assembly line, with
the job to tighten a bolt for every item coming down the
line.  Or even the one you stated where you are not allowed
to take more than one, or it is too heavy to turn upside
down?  Doing it for a day or so might be tolerable, but
day after day is not going to get good results.

If you are on an assembly line, you cannot average faster
than the norm, as you have no control over the rate.

During WWII, patriotic American college students
volunteered for assembly lines and piecework.  On assembly
lines, they lasted for a while, and then just became
totally sloppy.  The ones doing piecework were like
the bright one, doing much better than the norm, until
the boredom set in.  The only way out of it is to at least
temporarily destroy that part of the brain.

    It doesn't require destroying any part of the brain,
    it requires destroying the logical fallacy that creationism exists.
    We thought logos morons would have caught on to this activity by now.
