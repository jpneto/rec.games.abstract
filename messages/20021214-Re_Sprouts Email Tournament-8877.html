On the other hand, I also know from my own experience that there are
strategical ideas that can give us guidance and orientation in the
absence of a total calculation. The survivor concept is the best
example of such a strategical idea. A given position might have just
enough liberties to make 3 or 4 survivors the likely outcome. One
player will need 3, the other 4. The first player will try to "dry up"
the position while the second player will play for fecundity. The
players can meaningfully make these attempts even if they cannot do
the complete calculation. For instance, enclosing moves tend to be
more fecund.

Isn't it more tricky than this? It seems to me that it's not enough to
be able to say "looking at this position, it's likely to make either 3
or 4 survivors" -- you also need to estimate the parity of the number of
moves it will take before this happens.
