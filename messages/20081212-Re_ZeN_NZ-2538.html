I don't have a problem with that -- I don't think anyone does.


HOWEVER, as a practical matter, the moves on the squares of a 488 grid are
nearly, if not always, irrelevant. It isn't just that the squares are too
weak compared with the octagons -- in a game with alternating single moves
with no other special rules, they're <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>valuless<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. Games will be played out
completely on the octagons to the point at which one player will have the
forced win without bothering to fill in the squares. So, for game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>players<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>,
there's no good reason not to use the FCFC rule, *even when playing on a 488
board*.


ZeN is a fully functional game, but I agree with your subjective dislike of
the Quax method of making the diagonal connections. Requiring a player to
play in two diagonally placed cells before allowing her to play in-between
seems arbitrary. I also don't like the Crossway rule that makes certain
cells verboten.


In <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> opinion, there are only two ways to handle diagonal connections on a
4444 grid:


1) Use the "first come, first connect" rule. Any two cells belonging to one
player that share a single vertex are instantly connected so long as the do
not cross a previous connection. This works for grids with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> valency.


2) As you suggest in your version -- convert the 4444 grid to a 488 and
allow players to play in any square or octagon without restriction. Works
for grids of valency 5 or less ONLY.


Both versions can be played on a 488 grid or a 4444 grid.


You think the FCFC rule is inelegant and/or requires additional pieces. I
disagree.  In fact, the FCFC version can be played with whatever equipment
that your 488 version can be played -- whether tpaper and pen, an actual
board, or an ascii board as shown below.


X has won by connecting the right side to the left. The game could have been
played on a torus or not. It might have been your version on a 488 grid or a
game using the FCFC rule on a square grid.

The FCFC method can be extended to grids that have 6-valent (or higher)
vertices -- conversion to a trivalent grids breaks down at this point.



For example, playing a generic connection game on a triangular (333333)
grid:



    +---+---+
   / \ / \ / \
  +---+---+---+
 / \ <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>O\X<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> \ / \
+---+---+---+---+
 \ / \ <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>O\X<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> \ /
  +---+---+---+
   \ / \ / \ /
    +---+---+



BOTH the O's AND the X's are connected as their respective lines of sight do
not intersect. The central vertex doesn't belong to either player
exclusively. If the vertices are replaced with hexagons making a trivalent
grid, the connectivity changes:



              +---+       +---+
             /     \     /     \
        +---+       +---+       +---+
       /     \     /     \     /     \
      +       +---+       +---+       +
       \     /     \     /     \     /
        +---+       +---+       +---+
       /     \     /     \     /     \
  +---+       +---+   X   +---+       +---+
 /     \     /     \     /     \     /     \
+       +---+   O   +---+       +---+       +
 \     /     \     /     \     /     \     /
  +---+       +---+       +---+       +---+
 /     \     /     \     /     \     /     \
+       +---+       +---+   X   +---+       +
 \     /     \     /     \     /     \     /
  +---+       +---+   O   +---+       +---+
       \     /     \     /     \     /
        +---+       +---+       +---+
       /     \     /     \     /     \
      +       +---+       +---+       +
       \     /     \     /     \     /
        +---+       +---+       +---+
             \     /     \     /
              +---+       +---+



Now, neither the O's or the X's are connected. A different game results.
