Another one? Fine, I'll see if I can squeeze it in after supper. We're
setting the bar pretty low here.

Which is more than I can say for Cage. Besides Schultz, who expressed
an interest in Cage hmm? I guess Aaron Dalton programmed it on his
site but that doesn't tell me a whole lot. Two Cage enthusiasts and
one programmer interested in implementing it, that's the very
reception Canvas received and I haven't said a single thing about that
game on this site.  It wasn't me who recommended Ki for implementation
on iggc either, that was Shachtelhalm. My games practically promote
themselves!

You got it.  Meanwhile, can you stfu about Ki?  Nobody wants to hear it.

What gives you the  idea nobody wants to hear it? You don't want to
hear it but like I give a fuck. Apparently other people do want to
hear about it, a lot of people are interested in it. Tell you what,
you stfu about Cage, a game approaching its half-life and I'll stfu
about Ki, a game which I was pretty silent about to begin with.
