So here are a few comments on the 3rd test competition, which took place last Saturday:

So far the game itself is looking pretty robust. This time, if my counting was right, White and Black won the exact same number of games each, from a total of 582 games played. It can be mostly chance, but at least part of the reason for this balance must also be the easily overlooked cold aspect of the game. Every move you make alters the web of relative distances between units for both you and your opponent, and not always in your own interest. It may open new paths for your opponent (because obviously every move vacates a spot) and preclude you from making certain moves in the future (because of the obligation to always bring your units closer). Or, more dramatically, you may be too happy cutting the board in half with a wall of your own stones only to discover that you can't open it in time to give your opponent some extra moves, because he's cleverly forced you to pile up a massive excess of stones at both ends of the wall. Games 1381, 1837 and 1864 are good examples. Game 1815 (a 90-move marathon, one of the longest that I've witnessed) also featured such a problematic wall, but it just barely worked because the opponent happened to still have exactly one move available at the right moment. That was thrilling to watch. The reverse of the coin (a long game won by the narrowest of margins, but this time by the side without the mighty wall) was game 1440.

There have been no draws so far and I'd be really surprised if one occurred later. In fact, whether they're possible at all from the official starting position (no matter how weird the moves required to that effect can be), and, if they are, whether two players trying to win would play the game to a draw from the critical position at the start of the cycle, are still both open questions.

Meanwhile, the top bots are destroying the opposition. The winner only lost 3 out of 52 games this time around (2 out of 42 in the double round robin), and the second-placed, 5 (3 in the double round robin), with no bots having a positive score against either of them. The latter also holds for the third-placed bot.

Anyone interested in participating is still in time. The submission period is open until January 10th. It always makes a nice story if a newcomer topples the established champion. :)
