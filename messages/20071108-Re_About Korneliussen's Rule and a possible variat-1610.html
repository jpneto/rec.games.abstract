Any comments here?  Do people see this as a fair way to balance sides
that where balance is unknown?

If neither player knows which side has the advantage there isn't going
to be a way to balance the game. At the very least the players need
formulate an intelligent guess for this to be possible.

Playing both sides may not work so well either. Since after the first game,
players may have a considerable better idea on how to play the game.
And if you play simultaneously, you have issues with players copying moves.
