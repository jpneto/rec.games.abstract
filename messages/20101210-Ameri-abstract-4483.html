A certain bgg sweetheart proposed the name Ameri-abstracts, and part of the
explanation was this exhaustively tiresome notion of Europeans and
especially Germans not liking "confrontational" games.  I'm tired of hearing
this shit about Germans being so non-confrontational that they can't even
bear confrontational games.

I've been to Germany and Germans are a lovely, friendly people.  But I
didn't notice anything particularly non-confrontational about them.  This
non-confrontational shit is like a huge obese woman making a big show of
drinking a diet soda.  You're not fooling anyone.

The problem is not an aversion to confrontation.  It's an aversion to humor.
 A game has capturing, killing, conquering, maiming, annihilating, etc.
because it's a fucking game, and people with a sense of humor can clearly
see that.  Stop the European touchy charade.  It's nauseating to those of us
Americans who see it for what it is - a huge crock of shit.
