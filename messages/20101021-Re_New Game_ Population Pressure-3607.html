3. Starting with Black, the players take turns.  You may place one
stone  on any vacant space on each turn, until you have a group on
the board of size 2 or larger.  After that, on your turn you may
place as many stones on vacant spaces as you have groups
of size 2 or larger on the board.

Two points.

First, a suggestion - not vital, but tidies things up a little.

I suggest making the number of placements per turn to be
the number of plural groups PLUS ONE, in all circumstances.
This will avoid the rather clumsy wording above, and also give
a slight reward for making your first 2-group.

Secondly - a plaudit.  The whole game is a great and super-simple
attempt to get your ideal mixed creation/growth balance.

But even better, it is a wonderful, and rather natural,
way of getting a "progressive"-like modifier into some games,
this sort of game anyway.  Progressive games have long been familar
in the form of "progressive chess", where every turn the player has
one more move available than the previous player; 1,2,3,4... etc.

Joao and I have extended the idea in various ways, slower, and even
faster(!) than regular progressive, &amp; also using it on other games.
Some are particularly worthwhile; though usually there has to be
some restriction on the sequences of moves, to make it decently
playable (e.g. in progressive chess there may not be a check
except at the end of a series).

Anyway, in your game, as modified by my suggestion,
the numbers of moves per turn, (as long as the players
maintain maximal efficiency by never making bigger than 2-groups),
is 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 20,..  which is eventually faster
than progressive, though it probably wouldn't get so far before
the players started to grow their 2-groups bigger.
I doubt that sequence is in Sloane's list; but it could be!

Anyway, well done Nick, I can't wait to give it a try!
