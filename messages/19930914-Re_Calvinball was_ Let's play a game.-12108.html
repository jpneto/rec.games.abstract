Obviously this theme has struck a chord with many of the readers.  It's
reminiscent of "Calvin Ball" (from the Calvin &amp; Hobbes cartoon, by
Waterson (sp?)), and Mornington Crescent (from ?).  For those who
aren't familiar with Calvin and Hobbes, the only permanent rule to
Calvin Ball is that you can't play it the same way twice.

My friends and I used to PLAY CalvinBall in the shadow of the Washington
Monument in DC. It was great fun. I brought along a number of different kinds
of balls: very soft softballs, the "tiger ball" which was done in a tiger
motif, and two or three other kinds. I also brought surveying flags to mark
"bases" and "zones" and armbands for any number of teams.

We had two metarules: No person or team could make two rules in a row, and
no could DIRECTLY contradict a previous rule (indirect contradictions, such
as "rule valid tuesdays only" while playing on Sunday were OK). 

In practice, we would get together and outline a few rules and "victory
conditions" at the outset, and then permitted ad hoc rulemaking during the
game. Naturally, the "victory conditions" changed as soon as somebody or 
some team met the original ones. These games often degenerated into a
shouting match, which usually resulted in a "group nap" until tempers calmed.
All in all, it was GREAT FUN!
