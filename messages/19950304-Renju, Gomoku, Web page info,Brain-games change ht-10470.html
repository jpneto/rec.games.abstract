I have some additional information regarding the
new Web homepage of the Renju International
Federation for the games Renju, GoMoku and Pente at the
URL-address  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pi.se/renju/renhome.html">http://www.pi.se/renju/renhome.html</a>
and the home directory of Renju International
Federation at ftp.pi.se/pub/pc/games/renju

But first I have another question. 
Renju is a brain game like chess,go, shogi, othello,
bridge, chinese chess, backgammon, mancala, draughts,
oware, abalone etc.

Players of these games are limited and mostly they are
curious about other brain games. Therefore if you have
a URL-address to another interesting Brain Game Web page
or Gopher or Ftp-Archive I can make a link to  your page
at the Renju International Federation Homepage. Hopefully
you are able to do the same link in your homepage to the
page of the Renju International Federation. Please,
write to me if you are interested.


Now there are 9 files to found in the renju home directory.
I first made the general information in a Word 
file but I was asked to make this information in a
text-file with additional picture. Now you can find
this information in files "r1rulhis.txt" and
"r1rulpic.jpg". You can also find files with 
40 photos from  the renju- and gomokuworld (r3pic.zip)
and comments to these photos (r3infpic.txt).
There is also a file with more than 1000 games
played by the best players in the world (r2dafree.zip).
If you choose this file, after installing 
press F1, F8, F3 and browse with the arrows between the
games. 

If you can read Swedish there are also three files 
beginning with swfir94 from the Swedish Magazine
"Fem I Rad" 1994.

Recently I found that some of these files were not
possible to reach. If you tried you received the
message "Permission denied" or "Unable to locate file".
This fault is now corrected and all 9 files is possible
to get with anonymous ftp or directly from the renju
homepage.

In the homepage I alse refer to a good program 
Renju For Windows, Version 1.0  created by 
Russian theoretical physicist Dr. Artyom Shaposhnikov.
You can find how to get this free version of the program 
from the renju homepage and you can try to play
renju with it 25 times. It is a very good program
so you have to play very carefully to win. You can
choose degree of playing. Best is 1 Dan. If you 
want more information about this program choose
