This note is in response to the mention of En Passant as a "special case"
in chess.  The move is widely misunderstood as some sort of baroque and
confusing fine print, a dangerous attitude quite possibly directly responsible
for a much of the obvious moral and ethical decadence evident in today's youth.

Rather than being a special case, En Passant in chess is actually
a fix required along with the introduction of the pawn's ablity to
skip the third rank.  Were it not for En Passant,  a pawn would be able to
scoot by another pawn at that point on the board.  Thus, the integrity
of some basic pawn use rules, such as, well specificly, that a pawn
two spaces in front of a pawn of the opposite color in the file one over
will be able to take if the pawn (either one) moves --- this rule is
consistent, and applies at any rank.

En Passant is not a special case.  The pawn skipping the third rank is
the special case, and En Passant is the fix of the resulting bug.

,I hope this is clear and I'm not coming off as too much of a whining crank
wasting bandwidth with trivial and irrelevant concerns.

Perhaps one of the Xiangqi-ists could enlighten us Europeans as to whether any
of the rules of Xiangqi contain metaphorically equivalent historical origins.
