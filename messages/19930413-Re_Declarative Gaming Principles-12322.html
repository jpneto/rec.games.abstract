the rules and modifiers could be simply stated (on tuesday, anyone named
Fred gets to make one extra rule modification) their affect on the game,
partly from their abundance, would be that each game, while starting out
exactly the same and having the players try to duplicate the exact
moves, would end up being drastically different.

Although I don't think this somewhat mathematical definition of versatility
is really necessary for a good declarative game. I think it would suffice if
the players can pick their 'start-positions' by themselves, so everyone may
start the game with different assets and capabilities. From this alone it
becomes a different game each time. I think the introduction of time as a
factor in resolution is not really necessary, although it would be the final
means of generating versatility. But it would also be the final means of
generating confusion, because then likely no two game situations will ever
be at least similar. But if you can't draw from past experiences you don't
learn. And if you can't learn then you as a player may easily get the 
feeling of everything being determined by a great random number generator.
