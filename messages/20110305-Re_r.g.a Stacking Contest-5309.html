Exactly right, and exactly why the public has been excluded from the contest
vote.  Now the best game can win, and nobody has to stomach the sight of a
popular designer winning a popularity contest, and waving his game over his
head, shouting "Look!  I won a game contest!!!!"

There may be method in your madness, but it's madness all the same.
Your 'axiom 3' gives testimony to your complete failure to understand
that criteria regarding 'the best game' are subjective. The only one
who can be trusted to judge a Mark Steere game is Mark Steere.

The presumption of my 'popularity' is wholly yours. What can I do?
Become an asshole to boost your popularity by contrast?

I've always been a snake mother to my games: I publish them, Ed may
make an applet, a couple of sites may feature one or two of my games.
I didn't push Grabber nearly as much as you pushed MQ and mindsports
even made a MQ applet available.

So much for &lt; ... a popular designer winning a popularity contest, and
waving his game over his head, shouting "Look!  I won a game
contest!!!!" &gt;

I couldn't care less and regardless of the outcome, you will find
fault with somebody. I couldn't care less about that either.
And we're talking about future contests where anyone can enter, or not
enter.
