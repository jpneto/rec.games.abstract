This is a copy of a post originally made on BoardGameGeek and is re-posted here for the same reason it was originally written - because few people seemed to understand what I was doing with my "war chess" series, but the idea that gave me the games actually got some traction. Maybe it will work the same way here. Heh, it's worth a try.

Most abstracts seem to allow either unrestricted movement, or use previous piece placement to restrict free movement of pieces. And most abstracts do not allow the movement of more than 1 piece, 1 group, or a few pieces per turn. And while I am unfamiliar with the range of abstracts available, I believe it is true that relatively few allow a significant fraction, most, or all of the pieces to move each turn. Many games employ drops, and pieces may not actually move at all, just enter or leave the board, like Go.

Occasionally, however, a game restricts movement by designating specific pieces as activators, which give pieces the power to move/capture, or to move/capture differently. One good example of this is Roberto Lavieri's Chess with Batteries. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/contests/10/chesswithbatteries">http://www.chessvariants.org/contests/10/chesswithbatteries</a>..... This variant features very weak attacking pieces whose powers of capture are greatly augmented by starting next to a battery.

Another version of this is a piece that transfers the power of movement/capture from one adjacent piece to another adjacent piece. In a game with a small board and very powerful pieces, like FIDE chess, this would very likely destroy the game. Imagine the king has the power. Consider first a castled position. The king can transfer the rook's move to each of the pawns the king touches. That's bad enough, but in the starting setup, the king can transfer the queen's move to 3 pawns and a bishop. I believe there are a few games that use this mechanism, or something very similar, but cannot recall any specific one. Anyone know how many games are there like this?

What I've been investigating specifically is a "leader" unit, a piece that allows nearby pieces to move and capture. A simple version of such a leader piece can be characterized by 2 numbers, its command/activation range", or how far a piece can be from the leader and still be activated, and its "command rating/activation level", or how many pieces it can activate per turn (including itself or another leader.) I started with a range of 3 and a level of 1, Chieftain Chess. Then went to a range of 1 and a level of 5-10, but allowed activation for a specific piece to be "transmitted" through an unbroken chain of touching pieces from the leader to the unit about to move. And discovered chesimals, chess animals. Finally I went to a command range of 2 and an activation level anywhere from 1 to 9, and this eventually gave me the Command and Maneuver (CaM) games I discuss elsewhere.

The key idea here, whether you call it a leader, supply unit, or brain cell, is that you no longer have absolute control of all of your pieces. You only really control the leaders, and they control the pieces. It may not seem like much of a difference at first, but it does remove some direct control from the player, and put it quite literally on the board, in the physical locations of your activators. (Yes, I finally remembered to use the word I started with, "Activators". With any luck, it won't happen often. It's an ugly word.) And it has a great effect on move and capture games. It makes vast multi-move games more playable by imposing structure and adding weakness within that structure. It also makes them a little harder because you are restricted in the actions you can order by the variable positions of a few (thus vulnerable) pieces.

There are various combinations of activators, total pieces on board, and total activations allowed per turn. Chess with batteries has 1 battery per player and 1 move per player-turn. Frank Lange designed a very large chess variant with 6 or 8 kings per side about 1999, iirc. Players were allowed to move as many pieces in a turn as they had kings. Does anyone know of any others? Anyway, in considering leader levels, total activations/turn, and total pieces/side, you can have 3 different basic situations.

A lack of initiative is total activations/turn lower than total leader value. A lack of leadership is total leader value lower than total number of pieces. And then there's "move everything", where the total leader value, total activations available/turn, and total pieces are all the same. Now, add in the effects of activation range, and the specific rule about transmission through other pieces. In CaM and Chieftain, there is no transmission through friendly pieces to extend control range. With chesimals, there is, which allows things to happen like a short tail to appear and wag once while a chesimal crossed the board. Btw, a chesimal is composed of at least 2 or 3 piece types which move differently, and have different movement ranges/turn..

I've barely scratched the surface of these things, using 3 simple variables.. Is anyone familiar with or done anything like this? What sorts of games might this translate well to? And if this is something that's already been done to death, my apologies, and please point me to it.
