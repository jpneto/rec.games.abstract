If you don't already have it, you might check out John Gollon's book,
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Chess Variations: Ancient, Regional, and Modern<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (Charles E. Tuttle), 233pp.,
$6.25, paperback, ISBN 0-8048-1122-9. (I found my copy at Pegasus in
Berkeley reduced to $3.75.)

As long as I have the ear of those of you interested in variants, has
anyone tried a game along the following lines? The basic idea, which
I'll call "Wizard Chess", is that the Queen is replaced by a "Wizard"
who moves and captures like a king but is allowed to be placed or left
en prise. The Wizard may also move by swapping places with any friendly
piece (not pawn), including the King. I'm much too rank a beginner at
standard chess to be able to tell if this variation offers much of a
challenge. My guess is that the game will be much slower; also, you
basically have to checkmate your opponent twice to win, and the
teleporting may make things rather chaotic, but not much more so than
Shogi. Any other opinions?
