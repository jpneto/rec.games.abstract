Suppose you invent a game in 1996 and work on it and slowly get it up
to where you can put it out on the net for others to try.  Years go
by.  Then you find out that in 2009 someone else put up a completely
different kind of game with the same name.

Argh.

I don't think it's that big a deal generally, especially if it's a totally
different game, though I don't know the particulars of your situation.  Is
the name totally generic, like Empire?  Or is it more like Zygotes on the
Lamb?  Are people still playing it, or has it totally fallen into obscurity?

There are only so many decent game names.  If every designer who popped out
a new game was able to claim exlusive rights to words, there wouldn't be
anything decent left to choose from.
