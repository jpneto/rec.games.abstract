As always you can try Cannon online at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.superdupergames.orgorwww.boardspace.net">www.superdupergames.orgorwww.boardspace.net</a> along with
a slew of other abstract games.

Yes, they even have some of Mark's games

Thanks for the mention Dave  :)

Boardspace has one of my games, Dipole.  SuperDuperGames has 14 of my
games: Byte, Cephalopod, Copolymer, Crossway, Diffusion, Dipole,
Impasse, Mad Bishops, Oust, Palisade, Quadrature, Rush, Scribe, and
Tanbo.

I've created all but two of my games in the last 7 years, starting
with Impasse in May 2003.  My next game after that was Byte in July
2005.  At that time, I searched abstract games, and on about page 25
of the readout there was SuperDuperGames, still a young game site
dedicated to modern abstract games that aren't Chess and Checkers
variants.

Thus began a combined creative explosion between me and Aaron.  I was
making games and he was programming SuperDuperGames, including every
game I released for a period of time.  At one time early on I think
around 60% of SDG's games were MSG games.  Then as Aaron added more
and more non-MSG games over the years (I can only create so many), the
percentage started to drop.  Now MSG games account for 12% of SDG's
games.

Aaron was definitely instrumental in shifting my design productivity
into high gear.
