Here's a great game which is new to me:    Traverse (tm).

The copyright is held by Educational Insights, Inc, under license from
Glacier Games Co.  My copy was purchased through UNICEF, so proceeds
are going to good use.  I'm told it is also offered in some education
stores.

The physical board is handsome: a canvas board with a pocket into
which one can to roll the pieces.  The pieces are simple geometric
shapes of wood painted in blue, green, red, and yellow.  The board is
a 10 x 10 checkerboard, except that the edge squares are all light.

The game can be played by two, three, or four players, although I am
unsure about how the dynamics of a three-player game might differ from
the more natural two- or four-player games.  Each player gets all the
pieces of one color, consisting of two circles, two squares, two
triangles, and two diamonds.  Each player gets one edge, and can
arrange her pieces in any way she chooses on the eight central squares
of her edge.  A turn consists of moving one of your pieces.  Turns
alternate, or proceed clockwise, or whatever.

The goal is similar to Chinese checkers, namely to transfer the pieces
from your starting edge to the destination edge across the board. 
(Again, you can only fill the eight central squares.)  The catch is
that each shape has its unique movement:  squares move horizontally
and vertically, diamonds move diagonally, triangles move diagonally
forward but straight backwards, and circles move  horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally.  

Pieces move one square at a time to any unoccupied square or jump over
any color and shape piece, as in Chinese checkers.  They can also do
long jumps, i.e. in the direction of motion, they jump over n
unoccupied squares, a piece, and n more unoccupied squares before
landing in another unoccupied square.  (The move is symmetric about
the piece jumped.)  One piece can perform any series of jumps in a
turn provided each jump is as above and once a piece has left its
starting row it may not finish its turn on any edges square except the
eight central ones in its destination row.  Once a piece has finished
its turn in the destination row, it cannot be moved again, so there is
a slight hazard in the endgame of being left with a diamond which
cannot fit into the only open square in the destination row.

You do not remove the pieces jumped EXCEPT if they are enemy circles. 
Those are removed immediately as they are jumped and before you finish
your turn.  At the end of your turn you place the circle(s) on any
unoccpied square on that color's starting row.

Those are the rules.  I haven't yet gotten a feel for strategy. 
Obviously circles are important.  I try to move them either one square
from my starting row or one square from my destination row, rather
than leave them in the center.  (It is impossible to move from the
starting row to the destination row in one move, but once a circle is
on the second row, it can conceivably jump right into the destination
row.)  And it makes sense to (nearly) always move a piece a far
forward as possible.  But those are simple heuristics from fewer than
ten games.  Maybe in another ten, they'll be completely different.

So far, playing the four-player game, I've found that contemplating my
move before my turn arises does not do me much good.  Too much changes
with just one move, nevermind three.  If I have a move planned, I
often will overlook a much better move that someone else's move has
allowed.  Nonetheless, there is a clear sense that blocking another's
strong move is often useful.  And because there is so much going on,
no one will know whether such blocking was the purpose of the move or
merely incidental.  I lost a close game last night simply because
another player unintentionally blocked my winning move.

One fun part:  the game with four people always lasts a good number of
turns, and near the end their is usually a clear leader, but the
difference between first and last to complete is rarely very many
moves.  That makes it more fun for those who don't generally enjoy
strategy games as they are often unaware that the winner was decided
eight or ten moves back.  The only conflict I've seen between
strategists and non-strategists is over the amount of time a
strategist might spend thinking over a move.

There is a strong difference between two-player and four-player games,
simply because of the number of pieces on the board.  Presumably the
game is a theoretical forced win for the first player in the two-
player game, but I doubt if there are any obvious heuristic strategies
to prove it.  With four players the complications are amazing.  I
can't decide if, in the three-player game, the player with an empty
row opposite has an advantage or a disadvantage, and I have not ever
played with only three, so I can't even speak anecdotally about it.

Anyway, has anyone else enjoyed this game?  Anyone have hints on
strategy?
