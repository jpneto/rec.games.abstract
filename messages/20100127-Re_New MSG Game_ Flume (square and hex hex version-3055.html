Square Flume reminded me of a pencil-and-paper word game that I've
played.  If you reduce the alphabet to a single letter, "stone", and
put just one word in your dictionary, "stone stone stone stone", then
the word game is a lot like Square Flume.

But the reduced word game's "one simple rule" for taking another turn
is different.  You'd need to replace "play adjacent to at least three
stones" with "play the fourth corner, completing a unit square of
stones".  Of course, you'd need to replace the opening array of green
stones.

Interesting connection between the two games.  The "complete the unit
square" thing seems a tad generous though, at least at first glance.  I can
see a wave of one color flooding the board without too much trouble, though
this is just wild speculation on my part since I've never played it, and I
could be totally wrong.  My suspicion though is that the involvement of
words is a good thing in this game since without that component it might
devolve into a non-game.  The simplified game probably occurred to the
designer, and there's probably a reason he didn't release the simplified
version.

So I'm curious if you experimented with that the "finish the square"
rule instead of the "finish the T" rule as you created Square Flume,
and how it turned out.  I've never been sure how much of the word
game's strategy is dominated by letter choice and how much is
dominated by letter placement.

For me, from a design perspective, it was just about number, not shape,
although two certain shapes are prohibited in hex hex Flume.  In square
Flume, 3 or 4 connnections trigger an extra move, and in hex hex Flume, 5 or
6 connections trigger an extra move.  The max and the max minus 1 in both
games.

There is a fundamental difference between your simplified word game and
Flume, trivial though it may seem.  The "shapes" in Flume include only the
placed stone and stones immediately adjacent to the placed stone
(orthogonally in square Flume).  The shape in your simplified word game
includes one stone which is not orthogonally adjacent to the placed stone.
