Everyone's a designer now.  Connection games design is interesting and
can be somewhat easy compared to non-connection game design.  Puke on
a Hex board and you've practically designed a new game.  No, that
wasn't an insult directed at any particular game.  I'm just saying, I
think we're getting a little saturated with Hex variants at this point.

This does seem to single out my last design, Canvas. And I find that
all too coincidental to ignore, so I'll just dive right in to this.
Ultimately it comes down to who is making the games, not which
concepts are being used. I went back to the connection games geeklist
the other day and found someone coincidentally had the same notion to
make a connection game Amazons hybrid. This was actually the next
entry immediately after Canvas. Pollux does the job poorly with nearly
no creative input or understanding of how to design an abstract.
Pollux is the crudest smashing together of two rocks, labelled Amazons
and Hex. In Pollux you lose the game if you have no move available and
the towers move and shoot as they do in Amazons. I immediately saw
problems with these properties of Amazons that would not translate to
a Hex-like game. Firstly the goal of connection would never be
relevant if the stones simply blocked movement as they do in Amazons.
In Canvas the painters are permitted to move over stones of either
color. The other problem is that if the movement and placement
mechanic was the same as Amazons it would not produce a game that
would be very distinct from Hex. Instead of being able to shoot any
distance like the queens in Amazons in Canvas you either place a stone
immediately adjacent or you transmit a stone along a contiguous group
of your own stones to a space adjacent to that group. In Canvas
movement is not even mandatory as it is in Amazons. So Canvas ends up
being a unique connection game with distinct pieces, neither
derivative or Amazons nor Hex.
The real truth behind the story of Canvas is that I didn't think much
of it, because it didn't accomplish anything interesting from a design
standpoint. I figured it would have a brief stint in the sandbox and
I'd go work on something else but the next day I played a marathon of
Canvas games with Arty and he said he wanted to program it. I never
even mentioned wanting to see the game implemented. In fact, I was
(and perhaps still am) ambivalent about having it implemented because
I I strive for ideas like Particle Bond; games with design interest.
But I figured it would be pretty selfish if I told him not to
implement Canvas simply because it didn't fit in with my design
philosophy. Sure it doesn't solve any interesting design problems, but
whatever, it's a solid design and a fun game and having two designs
implemented on the site is hardly going to keep me up at night.

I don't really think there is such a thing as a "Hex variant" to be
honest. Hex is not a complex enough game to have variants. It's really
just one mechanic, trivalency. You can't call every connection game
that takes advantage of the mechanic of trivalency a "Hex variant". If
that's the definition of a Hex variant then you wrote the book on Hex
variants. Atoll, Begird, Mobius, Anchor 2d, Anchor 3d, Grand Hex,
Lariat, Hex KB, Loophole 2d Loophole 3d. I'm not going to comment on
whether these designs are part of the "saturation", because I never
claimed it existed in the first place. The point is, I don't think
every connection game that uses a Hex board could be called
superfluous without looking at the specific design first. I was
actually really surprised by Grand Hex. It's pretty interesting that
you can play another simple draw-free game on a completed game of
Hex.

I also disagree that connection games are easier to design. There are
just as many lame connection concepts as there are lame territory or
annihilation concepts. There is certainly no evidence supporting the
claim that connection games are easier to design than other games.
there are a total of 20 games listed in the connection games family on
BGG vs hundreds of Chess variants and several pages of Mancala games.
The real challenge for a designer, is creating anything interesting
that meets their specific design protocol, beyond that, it's all fair
game.
