  Ummm...the game [Sprouts] DOES terminate with 4 provided that with a new point on a
line the two new lines must appear on opposite sides.  Sounds odd, but it
works as a game.  It's called "Brussell Sprouts" (sp?) and instead of points
crosses are used so a game goes like:

 +          +        +        +          +
            |        |        |          |
            +        +        +-X      /-+-X
            |        |        | |     +  | |
 +    +     +   +    +-+-+    +-+-+    \-+-+-+

etc. Note that at the "X" and the leftmost "+" only one new line can be drawn
because the other growth possibility has no point to connect to without
crossing a line.
  So, with some modifications it can be said that there are at least TWO
integers in that range. [between trivial games and infinite games] ...

Not really, I'm afraid. Brussels Sprouts is a joke game. The reason is that
it always lasts the same number of turns, regardless of how it is played.

Outline of proof: the game starts with N completely disconnected crosses,
  with a total of 4N "lives". Each turn gets rid of two lives and creates
  two new lives, so there are always 4N lives in total.

  Each turn either connects two previously unconnected sets of lines and
  crosses together, or divides one of the existing regions into which the
  plane is divided into two regions. In the former case, each region of
  the plane has exactly the same number of lives as it had originally (one
  region lost two lives, but the same region gained the two new lives
  produced by the new cross). In the latter case, when the cross is drawn on
  the new line, it always leaves each of the two regions with at least one
  life internal to it. This means that each region into which the plane is
  divided always has at least one life internal to it. If any region has two
  lives or more, another turn is possible by playing in that region. So the
  game must end with the plane divided into 4N regions, each with precisely
  one life.

  From the point of view of each connected set of lines and crosses, this
  also means that every region adjacent to it, including its external
  region, has at least 1 life. If there are two or more connected sets of
  lines and crosses, not connected to each other, any region next to at
  least two of them has at least two lives. This means that a turn can be
  played; the game therefore cannot end with two or more connected sets of
  lines and crosses which are not connected to each other - all the lines
  and crosses must form one connected set at the end of the game.

  So we start with N sets of lines and crosses (each containing just one
  cross) and end with a single connected set of lines and crosses; we also
  start with the plane divided into just one region and end with it divided
  into 4N regions. Since each turn either reduces the number of connected
  sets of lines and crosses by one, or increases the number of regions by
  one, the game must last a total of (N-1)+(4N-1) = 5N-2 turns.

Since the number of turns the game will last must be 5N-2, the outcome of
the game is a foregone conclusion: player 2 will be the first to be unable
to move if N is odd, and player 1 if N is even. Note that this isn't simply
a case like Nim where a winning strategy is known: in the case of Brussels
Sprouts, any move is as good as any other and it isn't even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>possible<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to
play badly...
