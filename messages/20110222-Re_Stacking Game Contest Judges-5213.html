Monkey Queen - I can think of arguments for and against
whether this is a stacking game or not.

just a note: *The stacking element definition was

I don't want to dwell on it, but just logically....  We all agreed that the
stacking game definition should be loose enough to accommodate anything up
to and including Checkers variants.  But now, six weeks into the contest,
you suddenly have an epiphany that Monkey Queen is a "QUESTIONABLE ENTRY". 
WTF??  As though some new evidence surfaced exposing Monkey Queen as less of
a stacking game than Checkers.

I understand this and assure you that games will be judged

Ok, fine.  I just wanted some reassurance that Monkey Queen won't be dogged
by the "QUESTIONABLE ENTRY" stigma now attached to it.
