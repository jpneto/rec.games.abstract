I like the rule of placing not adjacent to your own color.  It prevents the
defensive tactic of just growing one huge group.  Why the two stone
placement instead of one though?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Strike - Slide an already placed stone of your color X number of
spaces in a straight line to an empty cell directly adjacent to a
group of size X enemy stones.  Exchange all of this groups stones with
stones of your color.  A stone may not strike a group it's already
connected to.

Seems like an interesting mechanism.  How often does it occur in practice? 
Is it possible that a play would be completed without any captures?  I think
there would have to be at least some during the fill in process, even
between ultra defensive players.

Maybe the final group size should be dependent on the board size.  E.g.
group size = board size +2 or something.

Definitely.

I know that there are various readers of this forum who could possibly

An experiment can't really be wrong but it'll be interesting what a bunch of
play testing turns up.

I don't think
it fits into Corey's design contest, although that's what got me
thinking about flipping mechanisms.  When I thought about what I
didn't like about flipping games, I wanted a mechanic that didn't feel
so random and unclear.  And flipping sucks.

My attempt at a flipping game ended up being too complicated.  You need to
keep the rule sheet on hand to remind yourself.

Mosaic rule sheet:

Your very own stones turn into your horrible opponent's stones.
That's pretty dramatic to me.

yep

And a stone coming in from all the way
across the board to change your biggest group to it's color seemed
like a rather satisfying mechanic to show it.

That too.  Nice work, Daniel.
