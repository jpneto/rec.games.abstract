To enter, send e-mail to me (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:springer@math.umn.edu">springer@math.umn.edu</a>) giving your name, IOS
login, and the division you plan to enter.  Since the two divisions will
run concurrently, you may only enter one division.

Given the effort required in running such a tournament, I will be directing
the tournament, not playing in it.  All players must be logged on to IOS by
3:45pm IOS time, and any players who choose to withdraw during the tournament
will not be welcome in the next IOS real-time tournament.

Tournament Schedule:

Round 1:    t:00 -   t:50
Round 2:  t+1:00 - t+1:50
Round 3:  t+2:00 - t+2:50
 break :  t+3:00 - t+3:50
Round 4:  t+4:00 - t+4:50
Round 5:  t+5:00 - t+5:50
Round 6:  t+6:00 - t+6:50

Where t is:
		- 7 in California
		- 8 in Montana
		- 9 in Minnesota
		- 10 in New York
		- 15 in England
		- 16 in Germany and France
(using a 24 hour clock).

The break after round 3 is expected to be a lunch break in North America and
a dinner break in Europe.  Of course, with such diverse time zones involved, 
these times won't be convenient for all ... I hope they are a good compromise.

I look forward to an enjoyable tournament for all,

Colin Springer -- Tournament Director
