This requires that one is already at the stage where
research can be done.  Even then, it is very unlikely.
Also, the work is almost certain to be busy work, of
the type which teaches nobody anything.

What about those tens of thousands of multiplication

Now ... these so-called bright people are being asked to do a
couple days of this.  All you hear is the grumbling ("I didn't
go to [sic] college (actually trade school) to learn how to
program so I could end up doing this", or "how is this going
to help me?") and various other gripes you typically get like
when a spoiled Hollywood is asked to do some restaurant work in

And no, it's not multidimensional.  This is the SAME brightness that
made this person so damn good at their work where, in fact, their
performance is showing the very same 3-fold, 4-fold, etc. disparity;
as well as in nearly every other task he performs.

But what if you put the person on an assembly line, with
the job to tighten a bolt for every item coming down the
line.  Or even the one you stated where you are not allowed
to take more than one, or it is too heavy to turn upside
down?  Doing it for a day or so might be tolerable, but
day after day is not going to get good results.

If you are on an assembly line, you cannot average faster
than the norm, as you have no control over the rate.

During WWII, patriotic American college students
volunteered for assembly lines and piecework.  On assembly
lines, they lasted for a while, and then just became
totally sloppy.  The ones doing piecework were like
the bright one, doing much better than the norm, until
the boredom set in.  The only way out of it is to at least
temporarily destroy that part of the brain.
