		Hello.

	
Though I lost the post, I remember somebody mentioning
the fact that Abalone and Reversi fit a few criteria for 
being defect-free games, namely the conciseness of rules,  
not having a no-repeat rule...

I like Abalone  very much, so I'm sorry to say that
this game <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>lacks<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> this no-repeat rule, as perpetuals can
occur in a game - or I missed something. In short,
Abalone's rules are not complete.


As for Reversi, I always found it a bit poor in complexity
- not that I'm strong at playing it, but just consider the 
fact that any not too dumb Reversi program beats any human, 
to overstate things a little.

This 'easily computerizable' aspect does seem like a defect
to me, to add my little stone to this thread (in case you didn't
guess, my favourite game is Go, way ahead).


And now for another weird fact about Go :

In the (finite) universe of all possible legal Go games, there exists 
one of maximal length. Has anyone ever considered that this length is
monstrous ? Of course, it is quite an 'abnormal' game (with a lot of
self-ataries), but it contains a fair deal of all the possible 'normal' 
games, for instance. 
I wouldn't dare trying to calculate its length, but I'd welcome any
pointer or idea in that field.

Just compare this with the bare 60-move length of a maximal Reversi
game... :-)

By the way, I also remember the fact that 11x11 Go is enough to 
reach both the (logical) complexity and the playing difficultness 
(if this word exists) of Chess. I got that from an expert in both games...



Sorry for my English.
