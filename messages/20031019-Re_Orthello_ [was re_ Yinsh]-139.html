I looked over the rules.  Can anyone who played it comment on it?  The
rules pique my interest.

I like it far better than Orthello, which it superficially resembles
in the flipping over pieces side.

Is "Orthello" significantly different from "Othello" (a.k.a. Reversi)?
:-)  All Google finds on "Orthello" is NetEssays.NET wanting to sell
me a term paper on "Orthello as a satistic figure," which is amusing
in itself.

Yes, yes.  Mea Culpa (which is probably also spelt wrong...).

Perhaps this is a name in search of a game...

What would Othello be like if you could only flip pieces along the
rook's-move lines ("orthogonally"), but not diagonally?  Anyone
tried it?

I don't think that would work - you'd run out of legal moves very quickly.

However, interesting variants of Othello include a version where you assume
that the edges of the board are stones of your colour when it's your
turn to flip pieces over, and playing-to-loose Othello.

 From my perspective, these are interesting primarily because practiced
players are suddenly no longer as good at it ;)
