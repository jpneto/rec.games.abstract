A good source of rules for abstract games is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com">www.zillions-of-games.com</a>.  Even
if you don't have the software, the web pages list the rules for literally
hundreds of  abstract games, some traditional and some original.

Ah, no, the rules to most of those games are NOT listed on the website
itself. There is room there for only a brief description of each game.
If you download the zipfile, it will usually contain a text or html
document which explains the rules in detail. But sometimes the rules
are embedded inside the Zillions help menu for that game, which means
you have to look at the source code file, which has the extension .zrf

Virtually all of those games were just made up by the author of that
script, and are not for sale anywhere as a physical set. So, there's a
lot of chaff to sift through, to find games that are really worth
pursuing. It helps to have the Zillions engine, to get a feel for the
basic tactics.
