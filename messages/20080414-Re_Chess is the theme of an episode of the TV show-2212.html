I wacthed a little of the show. They were calling a Nimz-Indian, first
a Sicilian then a Grundfeld. They then showed a capture on d3 that was
imposiable and called it d6. The final shot of the Chess Set has the
black Knight on f8 and Bishop on g8. This spoiled the show for me.

In the show, they showed a checkmate that happened 3 moves in that
wasn't a fool's mate.  I will say that Numb3rs was somewhat a
promising sign, but unless the media starts showing the game
correctly, chess is going to have a hard time picking up chess
enthusiasts to continue to follow anything.  Messing up the basics of
how the pieces are set up, shows contempt for players of the game,
which is not good.

Anyhow, on this note, if there was a well done TV show that involved a
chess player playing in tournaments, that's true to chess in that they
get the name of the moves, set up, etc... correct, would people here
watch it?  If there are over 30 million people who play chess in the
USA (please correct this number if you have a better number), that
should be enough of an audience for a TV show, right?  Maybe it could
be something like Numb3rs but instead of math, it is involved with
chess somehow.
