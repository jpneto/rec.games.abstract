I remember that I had seen a game (on here or some other popular forum for this kind of discussion) that had a 'two-layer' board and two (?) kinds of pieces. The layers weren't actually elevated from one-another a la three-dimensional chess or the like, instead forming two interwoven regions on the playing field.

There was a method for moving a piece from one region to the other, and a selection of movement options available for the pieces, depending on what region the piece moved from.

I've been looking for the game now for some time (I had initially thought that I ran across it while the one-thousand-year game competition was ongoing, but I was wrong) and have yet to come across the article in which it is described.

If anyone knows anything at all about this game or a game like it, even just the first letter of the name, the help would be greatly appreciated!
