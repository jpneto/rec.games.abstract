Nature vs. Black Magic:  A battle between good and evil.

The Board:  This game is played on an 8x8 chessboard, with the vertical columns  
(files) labeled a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, and the horizontal rows (ranks) labeled  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

The Pieces:

	Grand Druid	vs. 	Necromancer	(1 each)

These pieces rule their respective armies, using their great spiritual or magical  
power to hold together their armies.  When these pieces are lost, the game ends.

	Trees		vs.	Towers		(2 each)

These pieces are animated by the power of the Grand Druid and Necromancer,  
respectively.  They move as a unit, and serve as portals for their rulers.  They  
are very useful and powerful pieces, and should be guarded with care.

	Bear		vs.	Dragon	(1 each)

These immensely powerful pieces serve their leaders loyallu and make their  
influence know over great distances, wreaking havoc with the enemy forces.

	Druids		vs.	Wizards	(2 each)

The personification of the forces they represent, they begin the game facing off  
along the files and attacking one another along the long diagonals.  They are agile  
and adept at slipping behind walls.

	Rangers	vs.	Hellhounds	(2 each)

These represent the forces of good and evil.  They are highly feared because of  
their ability to leap in behind enemy lines, attacking in many directions.

	Initiates		vs.	Novices	(8 each)

These are the rank-and-file soldiers in the battle.  They have little power, but  
they aspire to greatness.  Through valor, they may become very powerful.

The Setup:

Each player sets up on the two ranks closest to her:

	   Nature:					   Black Magic:

	+i +i +i +i +i +i +i +i		n* n* n* n* n* n* n* n*
	+D +R +T +B +G +T +R +D		W* H* T* D* N* T* H* W*

(+ represents Nature, * represents Black Magic)

Often chess pieces are used.  The setup is the same, with the Bishops and Rooks  
interchanged.

The Moves:

No piece, except the Rangers and Hellhounds, may jump over another piece, friendly  
or enemy.

Grand Druid, Necromancer:  Moves one square in any of the eight directions.   
Captures an adjacent opponent's piece by moving into its square.    Cannot move  
into capture; however, it is legal (but stupid) to expose the Grand Druid or  
Necromancer to capture by moving a shielding piece out of the way, or to ignore a  
threat on the Grand Druid or Necromancer.

Tree, Tower:  Two trees move simultaneously.  One tree moves one square in any of  
the eight directions while the other moves any number (including zero) of squares  
in the same direction.   Only the piece moving one square may capture by moving  
into an adjacent enemy's square.  If one is captured, the other may continue to  
move one square at a time.  Towers move the same way trees do.

Bear, Dragon:  May move any number of squares in any of the eight directions.   
Captures the same way, occupying the square of the opponent's piece.

Druid, Wizard:  May move and number of squares diagonally or one square  
orthogonally.  Captures as it moves by occupying the enemy square.
Ranger, Hellhound:  May move to any of the eight closest squares not in a straight  
line (like a knight in chess).  May continue to leap in the same direction as long  
as no piece is encountered.  E.g.:  the following Ranger can move to the squares  
marked x:

	   ::    ::    N*    ::
	:%    ::  x ::  x ::   
	   :: D* :: n* H*  x ::
	::    :: n* +R +i ::   
	   ::  x :: +i +D  x ::
	:x    ::  x :: +B ::   
	   ::    ::    ::    ::
	::    :x    :: +G :%   

The Ranger may capture the  Dragon, but may not move to either square marked %,  
since it would have to land on an occupied square on the way to the %.

Initiate, Novice:  Moves one or two squares forward.  Captures diagonally one  
square forward.  After it captures, it promotes to the opposite of the piece it  
captured, i.e. an initate capturing a Dragon becomes a Bear, an initiate capturing  
a Druid becomes a Wizard, etc.

Henceforth, the game will be described from Nature's viewpoint, but everything is  
the same from Black Magic's perspective.

Special moves:

Passtree/Passtower:  The Grand Druid may, if he begins the turn adjacent to a Tree,  
move to any empty square adjacent to another Tree.

En Passant:  If an initiate moves two squares forward, a novice may capture the  
initate as if it had only moved one square.  This right must be excercised on the  
very next move.

Field Promotion:  When an initate makes a capture, it becomes the counterpart to  
the piece it captured, provided the piece promoting to has been previously  
captured.  If the piece to be promoted to has not been captured, the initiate  
remains an initiate.

Back-Rank Promotion/Rescue:  When an initiate reaches the back rank, it is promoted  
to a previously captured piece, and an initiate is rescued and placed on the second  
rank in the same file where the rescue occurred.
(approximate) Value of the Pieces:

Initiate		1			(1.5)
Ranger		3			(4.5)
Druid		3			(4.5)
Bear		6			(9.0)
Trees		2 for one, 8 for both.	(3.5/12.5)
Grand Druid	2, but loss is the game	(3.5)

The first number is in terms of Initiates as units, the second is in terms of Chess  
pawns.  Two trees are worth much more than twice what one tree is worth, because of  
the way they move and the Passtree ability of the Grand Druid.

Victory:

Victory (10 points) is achieved by capturing the Necromancer.  This is usually done  
by attacking him in such a way that he cannot escape.  (Remember, Grand Druids and  
Necromancers cannot move into capture.)  In this case Nature is Victorious and the  
forces of Black Magic are vanquished.  If an initiate captures the Necromancer, a  
major victory (15 points) is scored, since the initiate becomes a Grand Druid.   
This is very rare, however.

If a player is to move, but has no legal moves, and his Grand Druid is not subject  
to capture, he is stalemated, and loses a minimal victory (5 points).

In a tournament, a player scores -0.25 wins for a major defeat, 0.25 wins for  
minimal defeat, 0.5 wins for a draw, 0.75 wins for a stalemate, 1 win for regular  
victory, and 1.25 wins for a major victory.  (Note that the result always sums to  
1.)
