I'm trying to remember the name (and perhaps more important, the rules)
to a game that I probably saw posted on this group quite a while back.
What I have is the board and a set of pieces.

The board is 7 by 7, and there are 49 pieces, 7 each of 7 colors.  (Each
piece also has a symbol corresponding to the color as an aid to color-blind
players.)  There is a table of "payoffs" for symmetric one-dimensional
patterns, such as AABAA = 12 and AABCBAA = 19.  I'm pretty sure the game
involved filling the board and then scoring for patterns along the rows
and columns, though it's possible the scoring occurred as you formed each
pattern.  I'm pretty sure it was a two-player game, but it might have been
that there were two "roles" (e.g., choosing pieces and placing them?) and
you played two rounds, exchanging roles.

Does any of that ring a bell?
