Hopefully this'll post OK... and hopefully I didn't foul the net with
previous attempts at posting.

OK, a few months ago I saw this fascinating game at a relative's place.
We found it in a dusty box in the cellar, and I have no idea where
to buy it, and I've now forgotten its name, along with the phone number
of my distant relative (who lives in Wisconsin.) So, perhaps one of
you can help me out.

The game pieces: over a hundred clear plastic hexagons, a little larger
than a US silver dollar, and a bag to put them in. Each hexagon has
thick colored lines (or curves) drawn on it, three or more separate
curves, which travel from one of the six sides to another side. (Some
tiles may have more than three curves, and I recall some
of these curves on the tile go "over" or "under" others... some curves
may even split, giving you a "y" junction. ) These curves are one of
three colors: red, white, and blue, and different colored curves may
be on the same tile. (Although, some tiles only had red curves on them, etc.)

The game: each player pulls seven (or so) pieces out of the bag, 
uses them, then pulls another seven from the bag (just like Scrabble?).
The players take turns laying tiles down on the table, the object being
to situate the tiles, (by adjoining edges), to form a closed loop of these
thick colored lines. A player continues to play tiles so long
as he is extending one particular colored path, or until he uses up all
his tiles. If the player completes a path to form a closed loop, he gets
points based on the complexity, length, etc. of the loop.  

Anyways, it was a fascinating game, and I'd really like to get hold of it.
Can someone point me in the right direction... a phone number
for a games store that carries this? The name of this game? Thanks.
