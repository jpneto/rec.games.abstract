If you don't want to read it, then DON'T -- all checker posts have been
clearly marked as such.  But many of us are interested, and I don't see
why you have to be a poor sport.  The endless chess vs go debate got
tiresome indeed, but the checkers matches are historic and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> related
to chess in that one day a computer will play Kasparov (presumably)
for the World Championship.  It's also interesting to hear how computers
are doing playing against the best backgammon players, for example.
My guess is that if we took a poll the majority here would vote to have
the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>option<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (you are not FORCED!) of reading the checkers match news.
'Nuff said -- I hope.

	If anyone wanted to read about checkers then they should join (or
	setup) an appropriate newsgroup, not hijack r.g.c.  I'm interested

I have to agree with Andy. The whole idea of having a specific newsgroup is
being undermined here. I find much of the checkers postings to be interesting,
but that's not the point. I find ZEN buddhism interesting, too, but I'm
not about to start a discussion about it, unless there's some relevance to
chess in the discussion. Now, some of the checkers postings do have relevance
to chess, but many do not. It has gotten to the point where the postings
about checkers, postings protesting the postings on checkers, and postings
trying to show the relevance of checkers to rec.games.chess, and postings
about GO vs. chess, far outnumber the postings about chess. I'm ready to
start a newsgroup rec.only.chess. I think that rec.games.abstract is the
perfect place to post both checkers and chess postings. In fact, I hope
that the parties involved will read this in rec.games.abstract; because I'm
not going to post it to rec.games.chess.
