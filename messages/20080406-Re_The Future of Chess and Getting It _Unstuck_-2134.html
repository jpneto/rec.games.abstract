He has clearly stated his position on these matters in other posts in
this thread. He is interested in Chess variants - as witness his
comments on Gess - and games other than Chess, and has no objections
to their becoming popular, but a game different from FIDE Chess will
just have to make it on its own, rather than being somehow centrally
dictated as the official replacement for Chess.

On that latter point, I replied to him with some minor caveats.
