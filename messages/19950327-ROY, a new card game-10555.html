========================================
           How To Play ROY

      The Card Game for Slackers
and Thinkers and Relaxed Coffee Drinkers
========================================

This game was invented by Roy Fuller, formerly of the Mental Defective 
League and presently enlisted in Her Majesty's Royal Navy.  It was 
modified by Spike Walker, Dead Head and Disc Golf Player.  These rules 
were codified by The Crayfish.

====
ROY:
====
This game is best for 2 or 3 players.

The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

The object of each hand is to be the first player to discard all their 
cards.

1) Each player is dealt 7 cards.  The dealer then places the remainder 
of the deck face down in the middle of the table and turns the first 
card face up and places it next to the deck.  This card is the beginning 
of the discard pile.

2) Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer.

3) On each turn, a player may discard 1 or more cards.  Cards are laid 
face-up on the discard pile.  If the player cannot discard at least 1 
card, then he must draw 1 card from the overturned deck, and play 
progresses to the next player on the left.

4) On each turn, the first card played onto the discard pile must match 
either the suit or face value of the card on top of the discard pile.  
You may continue to discard more cards in the same turn according to 
these rules:

   - After your first discard, each card you play after that must
     either match the face value of the card on top of the
     discard pile, or it must be the next higher card of the same
     suit.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Example:   (H)earts  (C)lubs  (D)iamonds  (S)pades

   - You have these cards in your hand: 2S, 3S, 3C, 4C, 7H, 8H

   - When your turn comes, the card on top of the discard pile
     is the 2 of Hearts.

   - You may start by playing either a two (matching value) or
     a heart (matching suit)

   - You could play 7H, 8H on the discard pile, but a better
     play is 2S, 3S, 3C, 4C -- which gets rid of four cards.
----------------------------------------------------------------

5. After a player has discarded all the cards they can play
   on that turn, play progresses to the next player on the left.

6. SPECIAL CARDS

   Jacks -- Jacks can be played as wild cards to change the suit.
   When played in this manner, they must be the FIRST and ONLY
   card played on that turn.  The player announces the new suit
   while discarding the Jack.  The next player must either discard
   another Jack or a card of the same suit as that announced
   by the previous player.
   (Jacks can also be played "normally".  For example, you could
   discard the 10 of Hearts, the Jack of Hearts, the Jack of Spades,
   then the Queen of Spades, all on one turn.  When played in this
   manner, Jacks have no special powers or meaning.)

   Aces -- Aces are always considered high cards.  That is, a
   player may discard Q, K, A; but not A, 2, 3...
   When an ace is discarded by a player, the next player must
   either play an ace or draw two cards.  If the next player
   can play an ace on top of the first one, then the next
   player must play an ace or draw FOUR cards.  If that person
   plays an ace, then the next player must play an ace or draw
   SIX cards, etc...
   If all four aces are played in succession, then the next
   player must draw EIGHT cards.

   King of Spades -- When this card is discarded, the next
   player must draw seven cards and forfeit their turn.

   ** NOTE: **  If one of these "SPECIAL" cards is the one turned
   over by the dealer to begin the discard pile, its special
   properties ARE NOT APPLIED.  In that case, the person who begins
   play follows the regular rules of play:  They must begin their
   turn by discarding a card that matches the overturned card's
   value or suit.  For example, if the card turned over by the
   dealer is the King of Spades, then the first player must start
   by discarding a King, a Spade, or a Jack.

7. SCORING

   The first player to discard all their cards wins that hand.
   That player is awarded 1 point for each card his opponent(s)
   are holding.  The first player to 100 points wins the game.

8. HINTS

 - If you are playing with only one opponent, don't play an ace
   if your opponent is holding more than four cards, unless you
   have another ace.

 - Don't play the King of Spades too early in the game.  The
   player who has to pick up seven cards as a result may be able
   to combine them with the cards already in their hand and discard
   MANY cards on their next turn.
