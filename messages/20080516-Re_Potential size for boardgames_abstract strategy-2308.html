I'm not claiming there is, in any kind of moral sense. I approve of
people making money from their honest work.

But in a practical sense, I think that some games are suited to being
proprietary; people expect this, for that type of game, and the games
return value that is worth a premium and isn't diminished by one
company's ownership of the game. Monopoly, Milles Borne, Trivial
Pursuit, The Settlers of Catan, and so on.

Abstract skill games, though, seem to have too much competition from
the traditional games. And there's a certain status thing for being an
expert Chess, Checkers, or Bridge player that is less likely to be
present for a proprietary game - or even a new game. So the investment
of effort to learn to play a game well seems to be more effectively
placed with a traditional game.

I'm trying to pin down the different factors that influence the
success of a game, so that people who feel we need something to be
done to Chess - because it has too many draws, or too many book
openings - would have a useful direction in which to proceed.
Variations similar to Capablanca Chess have been produced in
