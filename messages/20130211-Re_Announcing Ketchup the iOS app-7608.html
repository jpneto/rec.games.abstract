You should. I can guarantee you at least one customer. My impression is that if you pay for it yourself, a good version will run about 5k, but in my case it was the developer's idea and I licensed it, so no cost to me but most of the proceeds will go to the developer and I only get a little cut. 

I like it this way because it means the developer has incentive to get it right and promote the game to pay for time invested (which at this point is a lot, given that 4 people have been working on it to various degrees for a couple of months). And my goal is to get people to play my games, and to build a reputation as a good game designer and publishing partner, not to make money.
