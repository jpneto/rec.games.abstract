This post is a copy of a mailing I'm sending to everybody I know who has an
interest in Othello, particularly on the Internet.  It is my intention to send 
a periodic update of Internet Othello Server (IOS): 

		telnet faust.uni-paderborn.de 5000

tournaments (both upcoming and completed), as well as other things of potential
interest to Internet Othello players.  If you want to be added to my list and
receive future mailings, please drop me a note and I'll add you.  I do not
guarantee that I will post all future mailings.

Upcoming Tournaments
============================================================================

Human-only IOS tournaments:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the past, I have run IOS tournaments in which rounds were played at
a rate of approximately one game per week at a time arranged by the players.
Unfortunately, there have been consistent problems with some minority of
players not completing their rounds on time.  As a result, in future I plan to
hold only real-time tournaments: all players are logged on at the same time
and play games as in a "real" tournament.

Such tournament will be held the first Saturday of every odd month (so the
next one will take place Saturday, March 4th).  If there is sufficient
interest (at least 6 players per division) I will hold concurrent Novice
and Open tournaments, the former open only to players with IOS rating below
1500.  No computer programs are allowed in either division.  It is my
understanding that these tournaments will be USOA-rated as well as IOS-rated.  
As tournament director, I will not play myself in the tournament unless there 
are too few entrants otherwise.

Tournament format will be 6 rounds Swiss-style, with a one hour break after
round 3.  Each game will be played with time controls of 25 minutes, so
the entire tournament should last approximately 7 hours.  Exact round
timings have yet to be worked out, but it will probably held early in
North America and late in Europe.  If you would like to enter please let me
know what times would work for you: the exact timing will be chosen to
suit the likely participants.

Computer IOS tournaments:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With an increased workload recently, I don't have the time to run computer
tournaments in addition to the human ones.  If anybody is interested in
doing so, drop me a note with your proposed details and I'll send them to
everybody in a future mailing.  The obvious time for such tournaments would 
be the first Saturday of every even month (unless the week-by-week round 
format is preferred).  I would additionally suggest that interested humans 
should be able to play in the computer division if they desire, although I 
don't expect many to have the stomach for this.


Tournament Results
============================================================================

The first Real-Time IOS tournament took place on January 6th.  Unfortunately
only four players were able to make it; in future more players are expected.
The results, after three rounds and a fourth "bonus" round, were:

  IOS name  name            score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. colin    Colin Springer  3+1/4
2. Parsons  David Parsons   2+0/4
3. markku   Markku Poysti   1+0/4
4. TravisS  Travis Snow     0+1/4

============================================================================

The computer division of the third IOS tournament ended in December.  After
playing a complete double-round-robin format (each program played every other
program with each colour), the results were:

             1    2    3    4    5    6
   IOS name B W  B W  B W  B W  B W  B W  prog.name (author)    score   avg.dd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. logtest  ***  + =  + +  + +  + +  + +  LOGISTELLO (M.Buro)   9.5/10  +15.8
2. kitty    = -  ***  = +  = -  + +  + +  KITTY (I.Durdanovic)     6.5   +6.2
3. REV65    - -  - =  ***  + +  + +  + +  REV 7.1 (D.Parsons)      6.5   -0.6
4. eclipse  - -  + =  - -  ***  + +  + +  ECLIPSE (Springer/Giles) 5.5   +3.2
5. yingyang - -  - -  - -  - -  ***  + +  YINGYANG (Sempronio)     2.0  -16.2
6. Brutus   - -  - -  - -  - -  - -  ***  BRUTUS (Geoffroy/Piotte) 0.0   -8.4

Here the row 2 column 3 entry is = +, meaning that as black kitty drew REV65
and as white, kitty beat REV65.

As you can see, it was another clear win for Logistello.  Excellent results
were also turned in by kitty and REV65 (running on a PC!).  Unfortunately
jcwprog (Othello Master) was unable to complete the tournament and was
withdrawn.
