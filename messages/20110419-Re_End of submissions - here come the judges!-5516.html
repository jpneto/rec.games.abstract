Btw, I believe that Symple has a sophisticated balancing mechanism.

Ah, you actually decided to read it? You may have noticed the final
paragraph of About Symple? It says what I said all along, but I'll
quote for your convenience:

"Is Symple a great game?

Not according to J. Mark Thompson's criteria in his leading article
Defining the abstract (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/">http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/</a>
DefiningtheAbstract.shtml) - criteria I happen to agree with. Symple
is all about strategy, with tactics in a peripheral role. There's no
capture and limited drama. But the game principle is new and
innovative, and the possibility of applying its move procedure to
other games gives it significance beyond itself. Without it Sygo would
not have existed, and Sygo is indeed a great game.
Symple is quintessential, which means you get what you find, for
better or worse. The inventor's role in such a case is limited to
observing a self explanatory organism.

Outlandish claims? Self glorification?
