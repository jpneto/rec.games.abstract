Hello everybody,

I don't know if it's the right NG for this post, if not please indicate to
me the right one(s)...
Or if somebody has the mail to contact people at Fundex ... (I found nothing
searching in the site).
Or if somebody has the answer ...

I have a question about the pips positions on the Domino-Dice :
It's obvious that pips range is 0-6 , that each D-D has a doublet on one
face, and that each of the other numbers (the one of the doublet being
excluded) appears once.
The question is : is there a logical / mathematical rules that determines
the arrangement of the other numbers ? (as for std dice where sum of the
opposite faces often equals 7)
What motivate the question ? It simply that I try to solve puzzles (perhaps
sounds silly to you !!!) using D-D (as I done  before with double-6 or
double-9 dominoes)

Thanks in advance for any help,
Faï¿½l
