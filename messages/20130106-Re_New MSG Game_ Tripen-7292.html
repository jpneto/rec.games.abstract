I dunno Mark, you sound like the resentful one. Its pretty simple Mark. Neither Luis nor I gave a shit about you getting "jewed" out of an excessive amount of Christmas money. The whole thing was ridiculous. I would have to feign caring if you were homeless and accessed iggc at the library, if its about how you didn't get 10 000 dollars (who the fuck gives money for christmas?) to furnish your luxurious lifestyle the number of shits I'll give is going to be critically low. Besides I don't see why your Thai prostitute should get 10 000 dollars.
