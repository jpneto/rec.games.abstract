   &gt;In article &lt;darse.714370337@silver-vly&gt;, I wrote:
   &gt;&gt; Chase (TM) is a chess-like game played on a hexagonal board, using two
   &gt;&gt; colours of six-sided dice for men.  The range of mobility of the men is
   &gt;&gt; defined by the value on each die, and certain moves allow you to change
   &gt;&gt; those values during the game.  Thus the nature of the playing pieces may
   &gt;&gt; vary, and this must be taken into account when computing moves and
   &gt;&gt; strategies.

   This reminds me of another "board + dice" type game, where the values
   on the dice represent mobility.  Basic description and rules follow,
   but I can't give the exact setup or size because this is from memory
   of playing the game only once or twice.

   Game is played on an (8x8) square board.  Each player gets (8) pieces
   that are setup along his back rank with different values showing on
   the top sides (depending on position) and specific values showing on
   the front (or back) sides, thus fully determining orientation.  (This
   is important.)

   Pieces are moved by 'rolling' them along the board, such that in moving
   one square, the piece will also rotate 90 degrees, putting a new face
   on top.  So if a piece starts with the 1 on top, and the 4 facing
   you and you move it 1 square away from yourself, it will finish
   with the 4 on top and the 6 facing you.  (They are proper dice in that
   opposite faces add to 7.)

The game you have described so far was (is?) marketed as Duell.

   A piece may be moved as many squares as the number on top of the
   piece at the start of its movement, and may change direction at will
   as long as it never reverses it travel.  Ie a piece with a 5 on top
   could travel: forward, right, right, forward, right; or f, f, f, r, r;
   or b, r, r, b, b; or l, b, l, b, b; but not: b, r, r, f, r; or:
   f, r, f, l, f.

I don't remember this rule, but you could be right.

   A piece captures another piece if it lands on the other piece at the
   end of its movement -- ie it has to land exactly.

Yup.

   There is (also) one special piece with only ones on it; effectively a
   'king'.

Yup.

   The winner is the first person to eliminate the opponents king.

Yup.

   The game is interesting in that the mobility, and hence, strength
   of the pieces varies depending on what path they take; and two 
   different paths to the same square can give different values for
   the piece.

Yup.
