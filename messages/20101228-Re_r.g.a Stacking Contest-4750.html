Welcome to the forum, Gert.

In games where a stack's checkers must be uniformly colored, position
doesn't matter.  Like in Dipole.

Stacking like-colored pieces serves one very important purpose though - to
represent the group count with stack height.  A stack of eight like-colored
checkers has an easily recognizable height.  A pile of eight Mancala stones
in a little pit does not represent its count well.  Maybe it's really seven
stones or nine stones.  This is why traditional African Mancala games are
primitive and imprecise.

Stacking, to me, is simply stacking.  The notion of some arbitrary level of
sophistication a stacking game has to meet before it can be considered a
"true" stacking game is painfully absurd.  Reasons for stacking: economics
and ergonomics.  As Christian correctly pointed out in another forum, you
could play Chess with stacks of checkers, but this would neither be economic
nor ergonomic.

Certainly there are games where one multi-colored stack sidles up next to
another multi-colored stack, and there's an intricate exchange of sub-stacks
between them.  Byte, for example.

Byte rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Byte_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Byte_rules.pdf</a>

But the notion of bending over backwards to rework the obvious definition of
stacking game - games in which things get stacked - simply to rule out the
pedestrian Checkers as a member of the class is ridiculous.  Now you have
this endless succession of "newbies" referring to Checkers as a stacking
game and being "corrected".

"Oh, Checkers isn't really a stacking game...."

Fuck that.

Now if Checkers play <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>started<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> with stacks in place and there was no
crowning phase, that'd be like playing Chess with stacks.  Wouldn't make
sense.  But the stack is formed <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>during<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play by moving into the far row. 
Is there a sophisticated, multi-colored sub-stack exchange with neighboring
stacks?  No.  An off-board checker is simply stacked onto an on-board
checker.  But it happens during the game and the stack is significant in the
game.

Game pieces are just ways of representing data in an economic and ergonomic
way.   In Checkers, for instance, there is admittedly nothing particularly
stack-like about the underlying data.  It's just that there are usually
extra pieces lying around and it's ultra convenient to stack one on another
to represent a king.  It makes so much sense in fact, economically and
ergonomically, that checkers are designed with interlocking ridges to
accommodate stacking.

It's convenient to represent Checker's underlying data with stacked
cylinders and so it's done - exactly as with Byte, though stack manipulation
is much more sophisticated in Byte.  The notion that a stack of two
like-colored checkers, formed during the game, isn't really a stack is
absurd.

Dipole is a stacking game.  The stacks could be replaced by polyhedral dice.
 So what?  That'd be a pain in the ass.  Dipole is no less a stacking game
because it could be played with polyhedral dice instead of checkers.

Anyway, getting back to the topic, I think the consensus is that the contest
isn't real particular about what qualifies, as long as stacking is involved,
although by the same token, I don't think anyone really wants to see any
Checkers variants.
