   It has been proven that Hex <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>cannot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> end in a draw; 1 side or the other
   must win. If I accidentally left this out of the FAQ, I'll make sure it's
   in the next version, coming your way Real Soon Now.

   The size of the first player advantage in Hex is very large; and in most
   of the games I've played, I've used 1 or 3 move equilization to counteract
   this.

   However, here's a little secret for those of you who are constructing
   a 1 or 3 move equilization position: (Any future Hex opponants of mine,
   just hit "n" now!  :)  ) Most players underestimate the size of the 
   first player advantage. So - whenever I construct a Hex position, 
   (at least, up until this public discussion) I do so with the knowledge
   that my opponant will choose to be the second player. For example, in
   various email and pbmserver games I've offered the following 1 move
   equilization a couple times: First player opens on the main diagonal,
   1 step away from the obtuse corner. Both times my opponants took the 
   second move - leaving me in a won position. Of course - one of those 2
   times I managed to piss away that won position... but that was because
   I moved incorrectly, not because the position was not to my favor.

   The key to seeing this is by looking at the game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>defensively<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>. If the
   first player opens in the center of the board, the second player can,
   with perfect play, almost - but not quite - stop connection attempts.
   The question is: how much additional help does the second player need?
   Not much - so make a "not much" opening, and be the second player, so
   to speak.

   If/when 11x11 Hex is ever solved, MHO is that the acute corner hexes, 
   and a few of their neighbors, are the only losing opening moves.
