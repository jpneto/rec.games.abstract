The Game of Word Ghosts

A Word Completion Game for 2 Players. 

This is actually a sophisticated game requiring players to have both a
good vocabulary as well as good spelling.

Requirements:

Pencil, Paper, Dictionary and Clock or Watch.


Object of Game:

Not to be that player who completes a word that is gradually being
constructed.

Play:

Each player takes it in turn to add any letter of the alphabet to the
head or tail-end of a word that is being formed on the sheet of paper.

Rules of Play:

The game is played in rounds.

The first player on the first turn of a round writes down any two
letters of the alphabet on the sheet of paper whilst having secretly
in mind a word of which they form a part.

Thereafter each player has up to one minute in which to add another
letter to the front or back-end of the chain of letters being
constructed. If they fail to add a letter within this time limit they
forfeit the round, the score passing to the other player.

Before adding a letter each player must have a word secretly in mind
which the letter they are about to add to the chain together with the
letters that already have been played forms a part of.

Example:

Supposing the following letters have already been played

            POR                      [Secret word in mind could be
DEPORTATION]

The next player could then add, say, the letter P to the end of the
chain thus

            PORP                     [Thinking and keeping secretly in
mind the word PORPHYRY]
            
The next player could then add, say, the letter O on the end of this
chain. Thus

            PORPO                    [But then this time thinking and
keeping secretly in mind the word PORPOISE]
            

And so on till one player is accidentally or forced to complete a
word. The player who completes the word loses the round.

Note: the Secret Words In Mind may change throughout the game.


Challenges:

Part of the great fun of this game is being able to challenge the
other player. At the end of each play of a letter the other player has
ten seconds, before they play their letter, in which to make one of
the following challenges, if they so wish (NB there is no compulsion
to do any of these):

a) "Complete Word"

That the letters played so far constitute a whole and complete word.
The player who has been been challenged can either gracefully accept
defeat or has 10 seconds in which to call for a "Dictionary Check". In
which case the validity of the challenge (that it is a whole word) is
verified in the dictionary. But note (see Scoring below) if
"Dictionary Check" has been called scores are automatically doubled.

b) "Garbage" or "You are Bluffing"

That the letters played so far cannot possibly form part of a real
word. The player who has been challenged must then write down the
secret word that they had in mind (or a longer word if they can think
of it in time). They have ten seconds in which to do this, or they can
gracefully accept that they had in fact been bluffing and lose the
round. Scores for the latter are based on the letters so far played in
the round. If, however, they reveal their secret word, whatever they
write down is then verified against the letters that have already been
played in the round. If the word can be properly made the challenger
loses. The challenger, however, has a further ten seconds after this,
if they so wish, to call "Dictionary Check" to check the spelling but
note scores are doubled after this latter call. In this particular
instance scoring is then based on the whole word that the challenged
player has been forced to reveal.

If the challenges are not made within the ten second limit then play
has passed to the other player and they then have up to a minute in
which to add another letter to the chain or lose the round.

Supplementary Rules:

The first two letters played by the first player in a round do not
count as a "Complete Word" even if they do.

The loser of a round begins the next round.

Any valid grammatical forms of the words being constructed are also
valid, even if they may not literally be listed in the dictionary,
e.g. plurals.


Scoring:

Scores are calculated at the end of each round. 10 rounds might
constitute a game.

a) Simple Scoring

1 point for each vowel. 2 points for each consonant. "Dictionary
Check" calls double the score.

Scores are calculated at the end of each round.

b) Scrabble Scoring

For a more sophisticated game each letter played has its Scrabble
value. "Dictionary Check" calls double the score.


c) For Gamblers

Poker players might wish each player on each turn to pay a small sum
of money (the stake) to a pot to be able to play a letter, the winner
of the round taking the pot. Challengers must pay double the value of
the stake paid so far to force another player to reveal his secret
word. On each turn in a round either player may raise the stake.

Or any other variations players may wish to adopt.

For those who don't have a sophisticated dictionary to hand a good
