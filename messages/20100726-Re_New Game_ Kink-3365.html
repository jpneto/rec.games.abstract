Of course these two terms are vague.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> post a list
of distinctions once,; but the key elements were that
strategic concerns tended to be GLOBAL and LONG-term,
but tactical ones tended to be LOCAL and SHORT-term.

If we agree on this terminology, do you still insist that Kink
is noticeably more strategic than other N-in-a-row games?

So I don't believe that Kink is predominantly strategic...that would
be a silly claim.  Like most N-in-a-row games, it's still pretty
tactical, and I doubt you could capture the flavor of n-in-a-row games
without this.  But I do think it's more strategic than your typical n-
in-a-row game.  Or perhaps I should say: there's more space in this
game for strategy to exist.  Part of this is due to the fact that more
stones are required to complete the winning pattern than in a typical
n-in-a-row game, and so pure look ahead doesn't get you as close to
your goal here.  Where pure look-ahead falters, there's room for
strategy to develop, though there's no guarantee that it will.

I have noticed certain, as you say ,"long term" ideas that pop out of
this game, which have no analogues in standard n-in-a-row.  The most
basic of them is that acute-angle Kinks are more dangerous than right-
or obtuse-angle Kinks.  There are a couple of other ideas which I'll
let you discover for yourself.  They're global, I suppose, in the
sense that they seem to represent general trends across the game tree
(take with grain of salt since I'm no Kink expert).  These little
discoveries give me hope that there really is more strategy in this
game than in other n-in-a-row games.  But I don't want to make strong
claims for it.  It's a pretty humble effort.
