I am looking for any and all information I can find about computerized
versions of the game Abalone.  I believe there exists one for the Mac.

I would love to get source code, but at least get an executable.
I would also like any information about the process of writing computer
AI players for this game, and why they have succeeded or failed.
I am also interested in source for a graphical interface (even if for two
humans, to save me the work of writing my own GUI).

For the curious, I am going to attempt to write an AI to play this
game.  It will be a scientific endevour (project for an AI class) rather
than a commercial one, although we may release it if it can play halfway
decent.

I would appreciate it if you could respond by e-mail, as I am not a regular
reader of these groups.  Thank you.
