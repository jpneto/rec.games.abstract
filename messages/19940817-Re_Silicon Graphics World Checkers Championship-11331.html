i once read that checkers had been essentially mastered by humans as
well and that the only way of winning a tournament was to come up with
more 'cooks' than the other guy, which essentially consists of baiting
your opponent into making a mistake.  samuel's algorithm is nearly
unbeatable, as i understand it.

Let me ask you:  if as you say checkers has been mastered by humans,
how would such a human ever make the type of mistake you mention??

chess programs are master-rank now.
