<br>Interesting. Did you run an analysis of the commercial game itself?

<br>&nbsp; No; when I got the idea, I'd forgotten the details of the commercial
<br>game. (And IIRC, the point of the commercial game is much more about
<br>physical coordination than abstract strategy; even if you can predict
<br>the whole game in theory, your hand could still slip and knock out a
<br>few extra blocks.)
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I played against your program on square boards up to 9x9; I always won

<br>use heuristics past a certain depth?
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; It only does alpha-beta up to a certain depth, and that depth was 2
<br>by default -- i.e., not far at all. At the leaves at that depth, it
<br>looks for the "one arch left" condition that it knows is a win, but
<br>that's pretty much all it has to distinguish between good and bad
<br>positions. So most of the time it's moving "randomly," with no way to
<br>tell whether it's winning or losing. Like I said, alpha-beta <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>
<br>fails here.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>If it's really true that
<br>the first player can always win,
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; It's not, in general. Trivially, the 2x2 board is a second-player
<br>win (as is the 1x1! :) The 3x3 is a first-player win. I think the 4x4
<br>is a second-player win.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>it might be worth experimenting with
<br>rule changes to come up with a rule set which is "more even" (e.g. which
<br>favors player 2 for some sizes of board, which would perhaps suggest that
<br>the player who can force a win would have to play very carefully to do so).
<br>
<br>Sample: I won when trying my first 9x9. My moves (and computer's response):
<br>B9 (H7)
<br>D8 (I9)
<br>C5 (H9)
<br>E4 (G9)
<br>F3 (I6)
<br>A2 (loses)
<br>
<br>My strategy is pretty much one of eliminating as many long rows/columns
<br>as possible except along the edges; then when there are few such rows
<br>left it's possible for me as a human to work out the whole game tree
<br>(I can handle up to a depth of maybe 2 moves per player, tops).
<br>That's why with each move I am destroying yet another full row and
<br>another full column. I don't know why that should be an optimal strategy!
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; One thing we humans can handle that the program can't, also, is
<br>seeing when there's only one "major" arch left, and counting the number
<br>of things that branch off of it. For example,
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OO.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OO.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OO.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OO.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .O.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OOOOOOOO
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OOOOOOOO
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OO.......
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .OOOOOOOO
<br>
<br>That game board has one arch in the second column, and then eight 
independent "branches" coming off of it. We immediately determine that
<br>the game will last exactly nine more moves (since each move knocks out
<br>exactly one branch), and so we know who will win. But the computer
<br>would have to examine (on the order of) 9-factorial game trees to
<br>come to the same conclusion via alpha-beta!
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>What is abstractly a minor issue, but which human players may dislike,
<br>is that your program is completely deterministic: it searches the
<br>game tree in the same order all the time, and in particular takes the
<br>rows and columns in order, so that it tends to respond with cubes
<br>near the lower right. Some randomization would make it strike out into
<br>other regions when there is no reason not to.
<br></blockquote>
<br>&nbsp; Yeah, well, at the moment what I as a human player dislike is the fact
<br>that the computer is so horribly easy to beat. Once it can win a few games
<br>once in a while, it might be worth investing in a random number generator.
