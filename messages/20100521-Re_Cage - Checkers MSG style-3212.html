Interesting game. The spirit is similar to Mad Bishops,
but the slower movement of pieces makes Cage a more
strategical game, less based on pure calculation. For
the same reason, the first move advantage must be
smaller. I like it.

Thanks Luigi  :)  Yes, a few people have noted the similarity to Mad
Bishops.  The convergence mechanisms are different, but the effect is
the same - forced combat.  Not everybody likes forced combat by the
way.  Without it though, there's always the possibility of a Waltz
breaking out.

Finite games of annihilation can have a "walking the plank" feel to
them.  There's kind of a direness, where your opponent is a friend,
but soon one of you will have to get annihilated.  It creates
tension.  You know there won't be a hug or a butt slap at the end of
the game.  There'll be a laughing face and a pissed off face.  That's
what you're up against.  If you can't handle that (not you Luigi, but
generally speaking) then play Abalone or something where nobody ever
wins.

Abstract Games Magazine once published an article about
another good drawless checkers variant: Sleeping Beauty
Draughts. Here is a link:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bit.ly/5YGSWX(it">http://bit.ly/5YGSWX(it</a> takes

Thanks for the link, Luigi, but I've long been familiar with this
game.  Sleeping Beauty Draughts is not a naturally finite game.
There's some ko-type rule followed by a standard disclaimer, "This
rule is only important in exotic board positions that in real play
almost never occur."  Meanwhile the rules unabashedly purport that
"However, unlike [Checkers], it cannot end in a draw," and "A draw is
not possible."

In Mad Bishops and Cage there won't be any inconvenient positions that
"almost never occur".

Don't you find the theme of Sleeping Beauty Draughts a little creepy?
"If a man reaches the opponent's back rank, he is promoted to a
lady."  What does that mean?
