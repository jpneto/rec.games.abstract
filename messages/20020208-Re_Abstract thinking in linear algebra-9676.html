The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,

Could you explain this last sentence, please? It sure seems to be the case
that learning mathematics is easier for young children than for older
children,

In my experience, some people who are bad at math are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>helped<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by learning
how to program a computer. When they write programs that do purely formal
string manipulations, they come across bugs, and have to fix them, etc.
Thus, they definitely learn something about formal definitions. Especially
about the difference wteen their own (vague) intuitions and formal
definitions. To a large extent, they even become 'mathematical minds', after
a while.

I have the impression that you meant something entirely different?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

To program a computer, one has to use mathematical concepts 
which are not usually taught to tell the computer what 
computations are to be done.  This is totally different from
doing the computations, which is what the computer does.

Programming a computer is not the same as understanding
mathematical concepts, but it comes closer than learning
how to do the mechanics of addition and multiplication,
and even solving formulated algebraic problems.  Some of
the differences are that in mathematics a variable is a
linguistic entity which represents something which does
not change in a given context, while in a computer, it
starts out with the contents of locations, and has
extensions of this, and does change.  Also, in
mathematics, there are several concepts of integers, but
the computer only deals with finite strings of bits, and
cannot do all of the mathematical operations on all
integers.

I have stated before that I would make the general 
mathematics requirement for college entrance the ability
to formulate arbitrarily long and involved word problems
at the high school algebra level, and also to translate
solutions back.  This corresponds to being able to read
and write declarative sentences and short paragraphs.  
I believe you will find that most cannot do this.
