So if it's meaningless, then why

1) is it defined thus: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/quintessential">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/quintessential</a>

2) should Hex be an except

I don't know. Each game is its own thing and it's hard to say that any game is "most typical" in any way that makes sense to me. The games you categorized as "dynamic connection" are all very different games. I don't see how one is "most typical" among them along any dimension that I can think of that has any meaning. 

It's too hazy a word for me to be able to learn anything about specific games or game design in general by its use. 

As for Hex, I'm not even sure if the word makes any sense in that case, but if it does, it's because it's hard to imagine that a more unadorned connection game will ever be invented. 

But now that I think about it, I don't see how simplicity in any way implies that a game is "most typical", so I take it back: Not even Hex is quintessential in any way that makes sense. It's just the simplest connection game..
