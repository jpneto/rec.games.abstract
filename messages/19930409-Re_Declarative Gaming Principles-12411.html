Subject: Re: Declarative Gaming Principles

In rec.games.abstract you write:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As far as game instructions go, they appear to be rather declarative
in specifying the rules as opposed to the explicit procedures.  The
rules are interpreted by the players who try to find the solution to
winning the game given the current state of the game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yessssss... What the players do is using that mind-boggling tool called brain
to mull over the situation and then often come up with intuitive solutions. I
certainly do not know enough about how the brain works to evaluate that in
more detail than I just did.
What I meant, was a computer program, which resolutes the game. Be it in the
form of a PBM-game (that's where I come from game-wise) or a regular computer
game. The procedural part is that when a player announces he wishes to do this
or that, the resolution of this plan is utterly procedural.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Game playing programs seem to work better when rule-driven.
Now there may be a difference between the rules of the game and the
game itself, or the play of the game.  How is that you see current
games as procedural, and what would a declarative game be in contrast?
Please clarify.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What is procedural? Well, IMHO, today's games (excepting role-playing games
for the moment) are designed such that the 'body' or 'heart' of the game
(call it semantics if you will) is a procedural definition of what happens
when I do this. The computer (be he a machine or a human, I mean someone who
computes the resolution to a given game situation) is the 'heart' of the game.
It is not the data (the current state of the game world) that determines by
itself what happens, it is the computer, who looks at the data and then does
something with it. I hope I am not too obscure...

Also, I may be completely wrong on this distinction, because way down on the
lowest level of looking at what happens, EVERYTHING is procedural. Even some
declarative specification is computed/resoluted one step at a time. Does
anyone, except me, see the difference, however, between this low-level look,
which is completely uninteresting for the player, and the high-level look,
where everything is declarative?

Ok, confused you enough for now, I'll give you a chance to get in a word now.

Ah, btw, I have taken down notes, when I was thinking about this whole issue,
and these notes (being procedural in syntax and declarative in semantics :-)
have now swollen to 25K. Alas, they're in German, so I don't expect anyone
will want to read them? I began to get a first glimpse of what I am trying to
do at 12K, so I don't expect to make much sense here in 2K. Well, maybe you
can help me.

Bye,
Ulrich

Well, just an afterthought: In a procedural game rules may be declarative,but
computation is not. In a declarative game both rules and resolution will be
declarative. Furthermore, in a declarative game resolution will not only be
dependent on the game-situation as in procedural games, but it will actually
be DRIVEN by the game-situation.

Ok, I rambled. Sue me.
