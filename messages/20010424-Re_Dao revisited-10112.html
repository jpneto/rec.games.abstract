I don't understand what you mean by "illegal positions".  Dao has 900900
ways to arrange the pieces on the board.  Of those, 16636 appear to be a
win for the first player, 16636 are a win for the second player, and 158
are wins for both players (hence impossible).  That leaves 867470
positions.  Each position has at most 8 equivalents under rotation and
reflection, so that means there are over 100000 distinct positions.  How
can you get anything remotely close to 400?

The rules of Dao appear to be:

1. Start in this position:

   O . . X
   . O X .
   . X O .
   X . . O

2. X moves first, and then players alternate.

3. A move consists of moving one piece horizontally, vertically, or
   diagonally.  The piece must move at least one space, and must keep
   moving in that direction until it reaches the edge of the board, or
   the next space is already occupied.  (The start position has 16 legal
   moves for X.)

4. A player wins by achieving any of the following.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a horizontal or vertical row.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a 2x2 square.  All four of the player's pieces in
   the four corners.  One of the player's pieces in a corner and the
   three adjacent spaces all occupied by the other player.

This certainly seems pretty trivial to solve.  I'm guessing it's a draw.
