  I feel that it's not quite as natural as, say, Checkers or Hex,
because it requires adding multiple pieces at a time to the board as
the game goes on.  I can't say <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>why<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that feels weird, since obviously
it can be played with either stones or paper-and-pencil just as easily

Well, I certainly can't address your feelings, but being allowed to make
multiple moves on your turn is a standard variant of many (most?)
abstract games.  This can be considered a multiple-one-step-moves
variant.

  Square grid has the disadvantage(?) that you can pass right through
a diagonal line, by traveling on the perpendicular diagonal.  It's a
change, anyway.  Assuming you allow diagonal motion, I guess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good point.  Since we always played with lines of pencil and paper and
never with pieces on a board, we did not consider the "spots" of the
grid to be more important than considering the line itself as a
continuous barrier, so this was not allowed.

Because first-stymied is the loser, this is clearly a "standard" type of
Nimmish game, a la "Winning Ways", though I don't recall ever seeing it
noted there.  Theoretically, the first mover (probably, for most sizes)
has a sure win, but it would take Deep Yellow to work out what it was.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

  How did you work that out?  Surely any algorithm that would show
that the first player had a win in a Nim-like game, would also show
what that win was.  (I don't think the symmetry argument from Hex
applies here, but I could be missing something.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Even nimlike games can be quite complex, so I don't think either
statement (first-player-wins or construction-is-as-easy-as-existence) is
a sure thing.

  CGT analysis?  Could you give a pointer to more information on
whatever that is, please?  (Scary... I took combinatorics last
semester and I've already forgotten how to analyze big Nim-like
games...)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Combinatorial Game Theory, meaning the theory of games with sequential
moves, as opposed to Economic Game Theory, the theory of games with
simultaneous moves.  The standard reference is _Winning Ways for Your
Mathematical Plays_, which is being reprinted in a frighteningly
expensive four-volume set of which two are now available.

So anyway, has anyone ever heard of such a game?  And whether or not you
have, give it a whirl - it's a lot of fun!  And maybe an eventual member
of Richard's play-by-email server?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

  What's that?  Sounds like something in which I might be interested.

Go to <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/</a> or wait for Richard to reply and
promote it himself.
