To Christian Freeling,

Often is it better not to encourage a DUMB guy because Thicket now A CRAPPY GAME  became like a GO.
ha ha ha 

How can this guy who did not playtested a game widely (he is lying blatantly when he said the game was tested) make such absurd comparison???

ReyAlicea is HIGLY DUMB!!!

My comment was that Rey was 'in the groove', considering his production of new games. I didn't consider the game, but on the face of it the mechanism seemed interesting. I still didn't consider the game but decided to wait till it had morphed into something more stable. I must admit I followed the modifications with some amusement. Tinkertown revisited. Once again it shows that tinkerhappy games lead to nice long threads.

As to encouraging versus finishing off, and sticktly in general terms: a blind man may sometimes catch the hare, a dead man won't. So I encourage other inventors' intentions, even if they won't always materialise as intended.

Playtest the game seriously. Just try to play ONE game but entirely (to the end) and you will see how many flaws. Change yourself the rules as you play to see if the game could be fixed. 
If gave a new board to play DAB without changing any rules.
If gave a new DAB by changing the scoring system (DAB increment).
Thicket is a crappy game BECAUSE it did not start from a good idea. What makes DAB a game boring is the fact that once you find the tricks it is finished.
A changing board will be the best solution to make DAB exciting. This idea is not easily achievable. At some stage in DAB the game is almost done. Sacrifice-gain-sacrifice-gain....
I`m not against encouraging newbies.
I`m against encouraging dumb guys.
Why I have seen in Luis an excellent game designer in the future because he gives lot of care to study the details of any mechanism. He quickly see the core of the game.
He is a good "fixator" of games (balancing, scoring and so on).
He is little bit technical guy.
ReyAlicea is HUGELY DUMB because he has not a deep sight on what is the game.
Producing 1000 crappy games will not lead him to be even a mediocre designer.
I hate his ass licking behaviour too.
I like Mark Steere because he is confident on his ideas. He will fight for his games and I like that.
That`s good sign.
ReyAlicea update his game not because he sees the necessity of changing the game (flaws and so on) but to "make a favor" to those who criticize" his game.
It is not the way to build a game.
Congratulations for your new game IO! I did not study it but it is a good initiative.
I will travel for one week.
So good luck to you with your new game.
I will test it in mid january.
For sure I will post here my thoughts.
