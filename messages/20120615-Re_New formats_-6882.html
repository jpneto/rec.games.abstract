The winning condition?

Specifically if you can't finish your turn, you lose. It doesn't matter if there would have been non-losing moves, if you start a move that you can't finished, that's it.

I'll assume that the winner is the one who still has a valid move to make aka the loser has no moves left.  I wouldn't use the verb "place" for spot since you're drawing it.  Also the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>spots being connected to 3 other spots<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is confusing since loads of spots are connected by lines.

Are these the rules?

If you are able to make a legal move,
1. Draw a line or curve that begins at one of your own spots and ends on any spot with 2 or less lines connected to it without crossing over a line.

You can't start from a spot that has 3 lines connected to it, either. Lines, spots, it's simple connectivity.

2. Draw a spot of your type somewhere along that line.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Then, if your move ended on a spot that had 2 lines connected to it -- so now it has 3 -- then you must make another move starting from the new spot.

As for the set up, how's this wording:

For the set up, you can start with any number of X and O spots, even unequal numbers of them. One player picks how many spots there will be to start; the other player chooses whether to go first or second, and choose which mark is their own.
