I am looking for an International Draughts board.  Is there somewhere online
where I can get one?

Yes.

- Salta is played on a checkered 10x10 board. Take an International
  Draughts board (I got mine from Paris).
- Place the board between the players so that the left corner square is
  black.
- You play on the dark squares only.
- Each player has 15 stones: five suns, five moons, and five stars.
  Each kind of stones are numbered from 1-5. For example, you have a stone
  with one moon, two moons, three moons etc.
- There are stones with green symbols and red symbols. The players are
  called Green and Red.
- Each player places their stars on their first row (the row nearest to
  them), the moons on their second row, the suns on their third row (but
  only on the dark squares) -- as seen from each player respectively.
  The numbers of the own stones are increasing from the left to the right
  (as seen from each player).
- Green makes the first move.
- All stones move the same: one empty square diagonally in any direction.
- You may not blockade your opponent completely, but you are permitted to
  blockade some of his stones as long as he can move some other stones (in
  French: "retirer")
- You must jump over a stone of your opponent if the stone is diagonally
  in front of you and you must land directly behind his stone (like a man
  in Checker).
- You may jump only one stone per move.
- YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO JUMP OVER YOUR OWN STONES !!!!!
- If a player forgets to jump, his opponent could call "Salta!" in the
  next move. Salta is Latin and means "Jump!" Then the opponent must
  take his last move back and must jump.
- OBJECT OF THE GAME:
  To move your stones to your goal position.
  Take Green as an example:
  The Stars move from the first row to the 8th, the Moons from the
  2nd to the 9th and the Suns from the 3rd row to the 10th row. As seen
  from Green the numbers of his stones must increase from the left to the
  right when they are in the goal position (as it was in the beginning).
  SCHMITTBERGER IS TOTALLY WRONG! His rules would make the game too long
  and over-complicated.
- After the 120nd move the game is considered "completed". You try then to
  reach your goal position in the shortest number of moves while you
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
consider
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
  any pieces of the opponent as non-existant!
- The difference between the number of moves which the players need to
  achieve their respective goal is called "points" (this is French! --
  so don't forget the nasal sound).
  The loser has zero points.
- Green gets one point subtracted because he made the first move.
- There is a special handicap system, and there are rules for Salta
  tournaments, and a unique Salta-Notation.
- Manners: You don't touch the stones with your dirty fingers unless you
  were raised in a slum. You are supposed to use Salta sticks to move

them,
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
  even if you "jump". You are supposed to be well-dressed when you play
  Salta and to behave like a Lady or a Gentleman.
- Well-educated Salta players speak French.
