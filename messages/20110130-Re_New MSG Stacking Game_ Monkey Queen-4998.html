Most of the Monkey Queen feedback has been extraordinarily

You've designed Particle Bond and a few other games and you seem to show
promise as a designer.  Entering a game contest would be good for you and
for the contest.  Yes, I was a little insistent about it at one time, before
I gave up, and I'll tell you why.  You were constantly involved with
abstract games every waking hour of every day.  You lived at iggc.  Right up
until the contest started gaining momentum and then you ran off.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>knew<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
it was because of this Bill Taylor shit, and I was trying to impress on you
that nobody gives a shit about that except you.

he wants me to concede that rec.games.abstract is not
broken.

Wrong.  Christian Freeling summed up your concerns with uncanny acumen.

"Dodgeson!  We've got Dodgeson here!"

Most of the readership has been here for years.  You show up coincidentally
at about the same time Bill Taylor returns to lament the invitation of
renowned designer Christian Freeling to the group.  You join forces with
Taylor, ranting about the group being destroyed, and then you take off.  You
think anyone cares if you now come back and concede the group isn't broken?
rofl  I don't even know what that means.  What definition of a group being
"broken" allows for an active competition among world renowned abstract game
designers?  It's absurd.  I can't even believe you're still bringing this
shit up.  It didn't even occur to me that this was your problem.  I thought
we were way beyond this shit.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I don't appreciate being used!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So don't enter the contest if you feel so violated.  Nobody cares.  I don't
care.  I made my case for you entering the contest a couple weeks ago, you
declined, and I forgot about it.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I still have no qualms about entering this contest actually.
Like I said, I don't give a shit. You seemed more angry
that I would pass up the contest than seemed rational so
I came to the above realization.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You're sudden disappearance in avoidance of the contest, which theory has
now been proven correct, was irrational.  You're still welcome to enter the
contest but please leave the histrionics at the door.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But that's not the only thing. There's the fact that you've
publicly tweaked Monkey Queen half a dozen times,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I made one major tweak and then adjusted size parameters a few times.  BFD.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You're acting as if what you have now is the exact same
product of inspiration and instinct that you had on day
one.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is.  Monkey Queens central, defining structure is exactly as it was on
day one.  The change from baby kings to baby queens was major, yes, but it's
still structurally identical.  The babies just have a longer range now than
they had.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Maybe not showing weakness is just your strategy to win
this contest, I don't know.

I couldn't care less about winning the contest.  If I wanted to win it I
wouldn't have campaigned to extend the deadline, even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> I entered a
game.  And I wouldn't be inviting people and encouraging more people to

You're way beyond paranoid.  You're delusional.

maybe you're just really passionate about this contest

Well, I was passionate about the contest.  Truth is, now I've gotten tired
of it and I'm musing about my next game.  Maybe a stacking game and maybe
not.

There's no agenda, Corey.  Would there be a bit of ironic justice in one of
Bill Taylor's ex-recruits entering the contest?  Sure, why not?  Nothing
significant or even noticeable.  (Dodgeson.)  Nothing anyone would comment
on.  But that residual awkwardness is your own doing.  You really leapt into
the fray on the wrong side, unfortunately, but it's something I think
everyone's willing to forget about out of sheer boredom.
