One popular way to neutralize the first-player advantage in Hex is
to have one player put the first piece on the board, and then let
the other player decide whether to respond to it or to switch sides,
taking it as his own first move.  Thus, it's advantageous for the
opening player to choose a "neutral" move.

The center cell on an odd-sized board is surely a winning move (how
can this be proved?), and hex.faq says that it's known that the
acute corner is not.  I would guess that the set of winning moves
is probably convex (in some sense), but I don't have much intuition
for what size and shape it would be as the board size increases to
infinity.  Is anything known about this?  Conjectured?  Does the
obtuse corner tend to be a win or a lose, or is it borderline?

Here are the results for the small board sizes.  "+" marks an opening
move that's a win for the first player (vertical), "-" marks a losing
move.  (Perhaps someone would like to confirm these results; I got 
them from an exhaustive analysis, mostly by hand.)

+|- + |- + +  |- - - -   |- - - - +
 | + -| - + - | - - + -  | - + + + +
      |  + + -|  - + - - |  - + + + -
              |   - - - -|   + + + + -
                         |    + - - - -

On the 5x5 board, opening A4 (just northwest of the obtuse corner) was
a particularly difficult win.
