I looked over the rules.  Can anyone who played it comment on it?  The
rules pique my interest.

I like it far better than Othello, which it superficially resembles
in the flipping over pieces side.  People I have played it with have
commented that the removing of the rings overbalances it against
the player who's ahead, and believe that that may count against the
game when players reach significant skill levels.  I'm not sure that
I personally see this as a problem, though.

Well, I felt in the beginning that perhaps the game would be better
and cleaner if it is played only to 1 row (the "blitz" game in the
rules).


But I still don't really understand your comment. After all, a good
player could block the other player's first or second row by having
too good openings himself after this, so that the player doesn't dare
make his line. This adds some additional depth.

And, a player becomes weaker by making a row, so you may need to
prepare 2 rows to have a comfortable game after you make your first
line.


This kind of rule, with 3 lines, is rather unusual in
alignment/five-in-a-row-games, but part of the reason must be going
back to Gipf, to tie the games together. There too, my only complaint
is that the feeling sometimes is that you feel like you start the game
all over again when a line is made, because
the board geometry changes completely. This is somewhat true in Yinsh
too, of course it is possible to plan ahead what will happen after a
removal, but the feeling for a "beginner" is that the game will revert
into chaos again.
