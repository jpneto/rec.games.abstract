What I mean is a random way to produce positions that seem to be nearby to humans, possibly increasing the strength of one side or the
other. For example, one could declare that in 5 moves, a pawn would be added to one side or the other, somewhere on the second, third,
or fourth ranks. Then playing out one position might reveal that it seems to win an average of 0.3 points, whereas another move might
win 0.2 points. Of course, this does not guarrantee that the first position was stronger than the second, but it would provide
feedback that I believe would be valuable to people playing ordinary chess.

It might be that the randomization method should depend on the position, e.g., if the tactics are tight in one part of the board, one
could randomly shift undeveloped pieces in another part of the board.

Hi Douglas,

I'm not sure I quite understand the your examples here. I think 
there are probably many ways, including these ideas, that could 
be interesting to play around with. I'm not quite sure what you 
mean by random in your description. For starters, how would these 
positions and pieces be selected for these moves or changes in a 
game's set up or given piece positioning?
