|&gt; In a three-player game with the above asssumptions, there exist
|&gt; winning connections that consist of only one node in addition to any
|&gt; precoloured nodes.
|&gt; 
|&gt; As such games aren't very interesting, we can conclude that there
|&gt; doesn't exist interesting three-player connection games that obey the
|&gt; basic assumptions above.
|
|You might consider games where each player colors exactly one node per
|turn, and so you know that the final position will have exactly N/3
|nodes in each color.  Then your argument wouldn't apply.

Not only that, but an interesting game would probably be played by
interesting players; in other words, it may not be useful to assume
the moves could be made in any random fashion. Just because a random
fill of the board might result in zero or three winning paths, doesn't
mean an interesting and balanced game does not exist. From a mathematical
standpoint, it might have a certain appeal, but "interesting game"
is really a very different goal.

Anyway, not all games that have been classified as "connection type"
satisfy this mathematical criterion. In Havannah, for example, you
can win by making a loop around a vacant or opponent-occupied cell
or group of cells. Kaliko is for two to four players; points are awarded
for extending paths and making loops. See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gamepuzzles.com/">http://gamepuzzles.com/</a>
