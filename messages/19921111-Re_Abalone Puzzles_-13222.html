There are (as far as I know) two Abalone puzzles that "come" with the
game.  As part of the instructions there is a set-up board and a claim
that one of the opponents has a forced win or something of that sort.

I recall being sent the second one as a "reward" for solving the first.
Has anyone come across other Abalone puzzles?  Was there ever an Abalone 
strategy book published (Ala' the Pente Books 1 and 2 back when that game
was making the rounds?).  Any information would be appreciated.

As far as I know there was one that came with the game, and then one
included in the N.A.F.A. (North American Federation of Abalone)
newsletter.  This last was a real stumper.  Took me quite a while to
figure it out.
