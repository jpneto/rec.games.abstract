Twixt is a game that was released as a board game by Avalon Hill in the 60s

get a computer to play it.

Twixt was originally released by 3M, not Avalon Hill.  When 3M got out of
the board game business they sold their line to Avalon Hill (which is why
AH now publishes Acquire, Oh Wah Ree, Auction, and Feudal, among others).
Twixt was designed by Alex Randolph, a fine and prolific game inventor.

The problem with Twixt, if indeed it's a problem, is that it's difficult
if not impossible to recover from a failed gambit.  Playing Twixt feels very
much like working out a tesuji in Go, except there's no broader strategic
context in which to place it.  As I say, I'm not sure that it's a problem.
