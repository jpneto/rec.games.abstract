And, a vicious Proteous player it is.  I can always count on human opponents
to make a stupid mistake that lets me win easily (or vice versa).  The
computer easily eliminates stupid moves and will quickly play itself into a
stalemate.  I'm going to have it search for a good "weighting" on its
strategy.  This should make it thoroughly nasty and vile!

Oh, I haven't gotten it to do setup yet.  That's a bit of a tricker problem.

The other drawback is that it's in Turbo Pascal.  I'll translate it into C++
one of these days.  (Yea right...  Maybe I'll even put in comments too.)  If
anyone is interested, I can send you a copy of the code.  

Anyone got any suggestions for setup strategy?  (other than, don't place
more pawns than your opponent)

Anyone got any algorithms for manipulating externally created graphics
objects?  I figure that I could do better if the display used shapes instead
of simple text.  Maybe I should just get my hands dirty and dig into the
turbo display library.
