It started with a big box of sound tiles, which I never ended up using (in favor of thicker ones), and exploded into a major renovation, starting with selecting a quartzite slab.  There was a stove, microwave and no tile of any kind starting out.  Still waiting for my custom, extended soap spout.  And I just ordered a long, narrow glass table to replace the two.  You can't see the projector.  Many months and really expensive.  I could have bulldozed and rebuilt the structure.  Lucky it didn't happen in my house.

I was already playing every day, but now I really have to.

nice and spartan vibe - abstract simplicity, clean lines, except for
the crack in the countertop - hope you got a discount.  but what would
drive me up the wall, so to speak, are the panels above and to the
right &amp; left of your computer screen - they are just the wrong size
enough to distract and i would be constantly staring at them, seeing
all manner of new games appear &amp; disappear with my focusing horribly
akimbo.

i play guitar and write songs myself, so it's good to remember that
you are a saxophone player!
