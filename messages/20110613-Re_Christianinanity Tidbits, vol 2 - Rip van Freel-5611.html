Christian Freeling, clinging ever more desperately to his crumbling loaf of
rotting baloney:

any different than before.

This is sad.  Not Bill Taylor sad.  You're still a world renowned designer,
Christian.  But why must you persist with this ludicrous, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>ludicrous<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
pseudo-science extolling the magical properties of your games?

Christian, much of the readership has some sense of math or science, or
both.  In my case, I was on the 8 year plan.  I flunked out of a number of
science majors and ended up with a B.S. in math, the common denominator.

To even mildly math/science literate individuals, it's obvious that in your
case, the portion of the brain that regulates such activity was completely
lobotomized at birth due to a tragic accident of some sort.

You are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> out of your element.  You're like a fish on Mt. Everest.  It's
painful to watch you, naked and alone, clutching your rotten baloney loaf. 
Wait... you're not alone.  You have Megafucknutz in the Arimaa forum.

My question in the Arimaa forum:

Show of hands: Is anyone buying this "convergent
Sygo" nonsense?

Megafucknutz's response:

OK if I accrue an advantage, and then give it back
again, we've returned from our short sojourn into the
realm of asymmetry to "converge" to the point where
it's a straight 50/50 that either of us will win.
... yes if we're talking about imperfect play.
It's actually fairly obvious what he's talking about
where if you stop to think about it for two seconds.

Genius.  Sheer genius.
