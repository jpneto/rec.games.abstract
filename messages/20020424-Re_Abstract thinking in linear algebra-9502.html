Here's an attempt to justify all this cross-posting to
rec.games.abstract:

What do you think of introducing games such as Equations
and Wff'N Proof to students? Many gamers recoil in horror
at the mention of these games, but that may just be a
feedback loop. If you're introduced to concepts of symbolic
logic (and rigorous thinking in general) at an early age,
maybe it wouldn't seem so foreign.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.wff-n-proof.com/">http://www.wff-n-proof.com/</a> is their website

Wff'N Proof, "The game of symbolic logic," has players
constructing proofs of complex expressions, using the basic
tools, or "Rules of inference," which undergraduates
typically learn in a Logic class. Equations is a similar
game, but deals with arithmetic expressions instead of
logical ones. The Wff'N Proof rulebook is excellent, with
21 games of increasing complexity, and plenty of examples,
exercises, and puzzles. The Equations rulebook is not so
good last I checked, but the rules to the basic game can
be distilled to a single page. The scoring system used
awards points even to the losers of a round, which I
suppose helps the feedback, keeping the kids from getting
too discouraged too soon. It also speeds up the game if
the goal is to reach some score first.
