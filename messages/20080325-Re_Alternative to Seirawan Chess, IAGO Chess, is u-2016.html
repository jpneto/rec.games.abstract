A funny thing happened on the way to wanting to promote Seirawan
Chess.  IAGO World Tour, in response to the question, was told by one
of the designers to "buzz off", and that he didn't like Chess
Variants, didn't care what the chess variant community named them, and
didn't want to have anything to do with chess variants.

Since IAGO chess was developed only <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>after<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> this happened, then, I
presume his complaint wasn't that IAGO was trying to claim ownership
of Seirawan Chess - as it is doing, understandably enough, with its
own invention, IAGO Chess.

However, the names you are using, taken from Capablanca Chess, for
those two combined pieces, aren't really the most common names used
for them <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, although Capablanca did use the name for the
Chancellor previously established with Chancellor Chess.

Instead, the combined piece Rook + Knight is usually known as an
Empress, and the combined piece Bishop + Knight is usually known as a
Princess.
