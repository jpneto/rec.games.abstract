Could those who are familiar with (chess) Kriegspiel, please give me
their answers to the questions below.


Kriegspiel is chess played between two players, each with his own board and
pieces, out of sight of one another; and thus unaware of the positions of his
opponent's pieces (except at the very start, the standard starting position).

There is a referee, with a board out of sight of the two players, with all
the pieces on.  After each attepted move by either player, the referee must
check if it is legal; and if it was, announce this fact, move the piece on his
own board, and remove any captured piece from the opponent's board, announcing
the fact of the capture, but not the piece. If a move is a check, the referee
announces this fact. If the attempted move was illegal, the referee informs
the mover, who try again to find a legal move; continuing until successful.

So far, I believe these rules are common to all players.


My questions concern variant styles of play, concerning check announcements,
and convenient short-cuts.  It is almost universal to allow (for convenience)
a player to begin his attempted move with the question  "Are there any?",
meaning "are there any pawn captures". The referee then announces whether or
not there are any pawn captures possible. This gives a little extra information
to the opponent, but is considered worthwhile (for speed of play), at least
early in the game, when there are still many pawns. A player may well choose not
to excercise this option later on, when his opponent may not be aware whether
he has any pawns left, (in general, one only knows for certain the number of
pieces left, not their types).

As I say, this "are-there-any" option seems to be almost universal; so much
so that there is even a book on Kriegspiel with the title "Are There Any?"

But question 1: do you play with or without this option ?

Where the "are-there-any" option is used, I have still heard of variants
concerning what is to be done if the answer is "yes".

One option (and seems to me the one in keeping with the spirit of the game),
and I suspect the most common, is that the mover must then keep trying pawn
capture moves until successful. But I have also heard of the variant where
he is only obliged to attempt one such capture, and then has freedom to try
other types of moves again.

So question 2: do you play compulsory pawn capture, or only 1 try needed ?

The last context in which I've seen variation, is what announcement is to be
made by the referee when check is given.   One possibility is merely to
announce the check, and nothing else. This seems to me to be most natural;
as the next (and most common) option may give away "unfair" information to
the mover, especially if it is a disclosed check. This most common variant
seems to be for the referee to announce "check along a file" or "along a row"
or "along a diagonal" or "by a knight", whichever is the case. I've never
been certain why this directional announcement is so popular. (It hardly saves
time, as most moves take some while to complete in any case.) A third option
is for the referee to announce the type of piece that gives check, (though I
don't think I've ever actually seen this played).

Thus question 3: which of the three check-announcement options do you play ?

-----
I would like to collect statistics, and votes, on these matters. Could people
please send me e-mail on their actual &amp; preferred options.   If you have
opinions or comments to give alongside your answer, you should do so, but
perhaps should post them instead, for all to see. In any event, I will post
a summary, with any extra interesting comments made.


Here are the questions again.....

(1) Do you play the "are-there-any" option?      (a) yes  (b) no.

(2) If yes, and the answer is "yes", do you play (a) pawn capture is compulsory,
                                                 (b) 1 attempt only needed.
(3) Do you announce check
     (a) with no further comment,
     (b) by naming the direction,
     (c) by naming the piece.

(4),(5),(6) the same as 1,2,3;  giving your PREFERENCE, rather than usual style.

To save space, could e-mail replies be in the form.....

-------------------------------------
1 a    2 b    3 b   4 a   5 a   6 c.
-------------------------------------
Even if you don't play, but have an opinion, please send a vote answering 4,5,6.

Thanks in advance for your contributions;    summary later.
