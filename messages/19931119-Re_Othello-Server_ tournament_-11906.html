I was wondering how many people would be interested in participating in
a tournament on the server.  I think the best way to run such an event
would be to announce the pairings for a round, then let the players get
together and decide on a time to actually play the game.  This would
avoid problems due to differences in time-zones.  Please let me know if
you're interested in something like this (and include your suggestions or
preferences if you think it would be better another way).  If there's enough
response, I'll organize pairings and we can get this going.

If you're interested, we're going to have to decide whether to allow computers
to play or not (or whether to have a separate tournament just for computers).
We'll also have to decide on time controls and the length of time given
to each round (if it isn't held real-time).

There would definitly have to be two separate tournaments.  If I'm guaranteed
to only play human players, then I think I'll enter.  Otherwise, I might as
well lose to my own program :-)  If some players are interested in
challenging some programs, then they can arrange it some other time.

PS: Can you beat your own program, Colin?
