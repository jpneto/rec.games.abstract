I don't think you have the slightest idea of what a psychopath is.

Clark, now looking back, you can probably see that when someone tells
you to fuck off like 50 times a day, and that they never, ever want to
play you at any game, ever, and they publicly out you as a
psychotically obsessed individual because they're nervous for their
own safety, and your response to all that is to ramp up your effort to
jump into every game challenge that person posts, that that's not
normal - like waaaay not normal.  If you can't see that, and you think
there's a rational explanation for that type of behavior, no problem.
I won't try to talk you out of it.

Well you are such an unpredictable guy Mark. At the time I had no idea
what the hell you were doing, jumping from room to room, I certainly
considered that you may have been avoiding me but  I also thought that
maybe you were avoiding sunscreech (who was also jumping from room to
room) or whoever it was, as I remember you seemed to be upset with how
poorly he was playing Flume. When you gave me an explanation of what
the hell you were doing, I stopped, not when Arty told me to. Arty
told me a few minutes after the fact. You see because I thought we
were on good terms, we'd chatted the day before, so I had no fucking
clue what was going on. Anyway, you are not describing the traits of a
psychopath. A psychopath doesn't waste time on the internet playing
abstract games. Psychopaths go to bars, pick up women with self esteem
problems, get into bar fights, have drug abuse issues or climb a
corporate ladder and there's probably a hell of a lot of them out
there but I don't fit the bill.

oh boy, of course! The ultimate "beef" of this post, my dwindling

Any perceived "solidarity" you had on bgg was just people not knowing
how psychotic you are.  But now that you've outted yourself with all
the histrionics, the presumption of normalcy has vanished.

Well I guess I never really had any solidarity there because I
couldn't possibly appreciate just how intellectually deprived that
community is until after seeing the response to my topic.

I hate to give Korneliussen credit, but he, and everyone else who
essentially said the same thing, were right.  You do dodge shit all
the time.  It's practically a trademark for you.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well if some guy is hurling feces in my general direction, of course
I'm going to dodge it. The reason I didn't respond to Harald's
argument was because it demonstrated a clear lack of understanding of
my position. Apparently he thought I was saying that all games with
draws are poorly designed. Besides that, I'm not sure what else I
dodged...  I mean sometimes I ignore something if I get bored with it.
I mean I'm not sure if I will continue to respond in that topic,
because I've lost interest in listening to nonsense replies like it's
not important that a game is competitive and ad-hominem attacks and
accusations of outbursts. I'm sick and tired of that shit, it doesn't
mean I'm dodging it or admitting defeat.

BGG is just a shambles in general and I can find few redeeming qualities for it.

Bgg is a database for games.  It serves a purpose.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It has a shitty format, very poor quality control for one of the most
despotic websites on the face of the internet. I can think of few
sites that are more annoying to use. I've been waiting for days now
for them to accept a rules file that I created for Ki. I had to
personally contact an admin and ask them to remove an image I created
and uploaded myself. Still, it's really the only place where I can
promote my games.
