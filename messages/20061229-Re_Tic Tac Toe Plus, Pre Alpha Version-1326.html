It's a "hello world" program.  Or a "Yes, I figured out how to use
Gamemaker software" program.  Normally one wouldn't make an
announcement about something of such little significance.  Question is,
where do you go from here?  If you put a lot of time into turning Tic
Tac Toe into Tic Tac Toe Plus, you're going to end up with something
utterly non-spectacular.

You're wearing too many hats, Mitoshima.  Leave the game design to the
game designers, like me.  You just write the program.  Your graphical
interface and the AI portion you write will be your contribution.

Let me show you a program that was recently written for one of my
games, Cephalopod, using the Zillions of Games platform:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/65955?do=show;id=1362">http://www.zillions-of-games.com/cgi-bin/zilligames/submissions.cgi/65955?do=show;id=1362</a>

Something like that program, with its strong AI component, is what
you're ultimately shooting for.  But even now you need to set your
sites a little higher, even for a first time project.

You might want to take a look at Scibe, my latest game.  Nobody has
programmed it for offline play yet:

Copolymer, another of my games, is ultra simple but the AI would be
extraordinarily difficult.   I wouldn't recommend using Copolymer for a
first time AI programming project.

The pre-alpha version of Tic Tac Toe Plus, which is actually a Tic Tac
Toe game, will be made available on Wed 27th.

Your contribution is needed and will be appreciated as we would like
persons to sample this version of the game and give their honest
comments, whether good or bad, report errors and problems, or give any
good idea that will be splendid for the game.

This version is only a pre-alpha version, it is not a completed game,
therefore do not expect mush visuals, options or gameplay as a matter
of fact.

To test the pre-alpha version, subscribe to the group "Makers Of Video

When your membership is permitted, which should not take any longer
than 6 hours, you can then download and play the game.

Give all comments, reports, ideas and ask any question in the topic
labelled "Comments on Tic Tac Toe Plus, Pre Alpha Version" at the group
"Makers Of Video Games."

Please read the Page labelled "Tic Tac Toe Plus, Pre Alpha Version" in
