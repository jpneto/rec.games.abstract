When there's a consensus, a game such as

for the expert Dots and Boxes player though who has all the clarity he
needs.

Good point.  People rarely discuss this, but to my mind the concept of
clarity isn't very useful for this reason.  More clarity isn't always
better (tic tac toe), and you can't tell if any particular game is
inherently unclear or rather you're just an idiot.  In addition, the
best games seem to reveal themselves only very slowly, and you
repeatedly discover that you're playing poorly in various ways.  In
this view, great games are kind of opaque to begin with.  Perhaps the
best games only give us the illusion of clarity, when in fact we've no
idea and we have to discover that fact.  I think this is one way in
which Go excels.  You start playing it, and you think, "ok, I know
what's going on!  I gotta try to capture my opponent's groups pronto",
so you feel like you've got a handle on it, but in fact going for
quick captures is a really dumb thing to do.  That kind of thing
happens again and again when you learn Go.  So maybe what we really
want to achieve is something like "overcome-able opacity wrapped in
fake clarity" to coin a dumb phrase.
