Could you please lay out, in detail and in a single, coherent post, why
you think Atoll is the only possible generalization of Hex? I've seen
bits and pieces of your reasoning in various posts, but I don't think
I'm getting all of it. I can see the difficulties involved in attempts
to make other generalizations, but just because it's difficult doesn't
mean it's impossible, and I'd like a good argument as to why it might be
impossible.

I never said Atoll was the only possible generalization of Hex,
although I do happen to strongly suspect that to be the case.  Atoll
is currently the only generalization of Hex.  I'm certain that I would
have heard about any others by now if they did in fact exist.
