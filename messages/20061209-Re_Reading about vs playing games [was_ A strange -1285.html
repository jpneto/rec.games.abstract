Patrick,

Thanks for writing what turned out to be an interesting topic to read, at 
least for me.

I urge you to take a much closer look at backgammon.

First of all, I too love games, specifically abstract strategy games.  My 
favorite game is probably chess... been a fan since 1972.  I own more chess 
books (300+) and more chess magazines (1000+?) than I have room for.  I've 
entered more than 40 tournaments in the past dozen or so years, and would 
enter more often if I didn't currently have to work weekends.

I also love checkers, go, Twixt, Abalone, Connect-4, Pente, Amazons, hex, 
Quoridor and dozens and dozens of other abstract strategy games, many of 
which you've probably never even heard of.

Not only do I love PLAYING them, I love STUDYING them.

Us chess players are fortunate... (at least most of us.)  We can be just as 
happy playing chess as are studying the game, or enjoying a previously 
played game or simply reading about chess, etc.

And yet, ask any football player if he enjoys practicing football (a 
scrimmage) or actually playing/participating in a football game.  999 out of 
1,000 players are probably going to say "playing."  In fact, most probably 
strongly dislike the practice and the drills!  They want to PLAY!

I own 100+ books on poker, 40+ books on backgammon, numerous books on 
Scrabble, checkers, go, etc.  I truly enjoy practicing and attempting to 
improve my knowledge of these games as much as I enjoy playing them.  Rare, 
probably, I agree... but it's who I am.

I mention backgammon because that's my latest addiction.  Lately, playing or 
studying about backgammon is how I spend most of my free time.  There is a 
LOT of information out there from the numerous backgammon sites, backgammon 
articles, books, magazines, etc.

I don't know how much you know about backgammon but please note... there is 
a LOT less "luck" involved than you might think. Oh sure, luck plays a 
role... over the short-run.  For a short match, a beginner could even beat a 
master.  But over the long-run, over the course of a long match, over the 
course of many, many games, the amateur/beginner isn't going to stand a 
chance against a strong player.

That can actually be an advantage over chess.  By that, I mean this... 
unless you and your opponent are somewhat evenly matched, a chess game 
between the two of you probably won't be much fun... the stronger player is 
going to always win.  But the difference in skill between two backgammon 
players can be greater, and yet both can still have fun and enjoy a game 
together.

One big disadvantage in attempting to master Nine Men's Morris, or Amazons, 
or some of the other abstract strategy games you and others have mentioned, 
is the lack of tournaments and players.  How many Twixt tournaments are held 
regularly here in the United States?  How may hex tournaments?  At least 
with backgammon and chess, (and Scrabble, too) is that there ARE tournaments 
you can enter... there IS a vast library on the subject... there ARE a great 
number of players who will be available to play a game with you both online 
and off.

I think it would be quite unfortunate, in a way, to master "Game X"  and 
then have no one to play with, simply because "Game X" is not a very popular 
game.

The more I find out about backgammon (and I've been playing it for many, 
many years) the more I realize how little I knew.  To those who don't play, 
or who know little about the game, yes it's a racing game and yes, the 
person who bears off all his or her checkers off first is the winner, but 
there is MUCH room for strategy and maneuvering.  It's much more than just a 
racing game, where the one who throws the higher numbers on the die is the 
winner.  In fact, you don't always want to hit your opponent, (and send him 
back) you don't always want to roll high numbers... (which may ruin your 
timing).  Depending upon the initial rolls of the dice and how the game 
develops, you can get into a running game, a priming game, a holding game, a 
back game.  And I won't even get into the entire aspect about the 
intricacies of the doubling cube, which is an skill and an art all by 
itself.

Just from the few posts you've written, concerning your age and past 
history, I can say with near certainty that you will probably never master 
chess... the road is just too long and the mountain too high.  Sorry.  But 
even at your age you CAN master backgammon; you don't have a mountain in 
front of you, just an incredibly large hill!

Even to me, a chess player at heart, one who loves chess and always will, 
backgammon is the more exciting of the two games.  (It actually hurts to 
type that... but it's true.)

I recently attended (attended, not entered since I had to work) the 
California State Backgammon Championships held this past weekend.  I'm 
currently playing online at several different backgammon sites.  I'm playing 
backgammon live with a friend at work.  I'm currently having loads of fun 
analyzing positions with the super strong neural net backgammon programs 
that exist.  I'm re-reading old backgammon books and purchasing new ones. 
I'm about to drop $400.00 for a large, wood, tournament-size backgammon set 
from Gammon Village.  Lately I just can't get enough of the game... and this 
is from someone who likes abstract strategy games... games of SKILL.


I've rambled enough...
