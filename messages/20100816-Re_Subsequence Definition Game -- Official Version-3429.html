Interesting.. a sort of descriptive entropy aspect to the scoring, a

Is "integer part" sufficiently defined when the quotient is negative?
Do you mean floor or closest-to-zero?

Of course, for more than two players, you will often have the
situation where a player can't win but her choice determines who does
win.  Maybe even during the creation of the sequence.

Do you need to define who is going to move first in the second phase
(or more generally, what the turn order will be), prior to the first
phase?  Will it be whichever player would have made the m+1st pick
during phase 1, or the player who went first in phase 1, or someone
else?

By the way, are you familiar with David Parlett's game Abstrac
(published in some book in the 1980s I think)?  Not exactly the same
thing as yours, but similar in the sense that players choose a
variable-length subsequence from one end of a sequence.  In Abstrac,
which is for two players, the sequence is dealt from a short deck of
cards, and scoring rewards patterns collected and penalizes for the
number of cards taken.
