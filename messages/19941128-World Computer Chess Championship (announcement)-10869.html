	The 8th ICCA World Computer Chess Championship
		at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
			May 25-30, 1995

NEWS RELEASE: 23 November 1994

The ICCA is delighted to announce that the Chinese University of Hong Kong 
will host the 8th ICCA World Computer Chess Championship.  The five-round 
championship, with one round each day beginning onThursday May 25th, will 
be followed by a match featuring the world's best computers and some of 
the top players in Asia.

The world's strongest chess-playing computers are expected to participate 
including IBM's DEEP BLUE, currently considered the best, FRITZ (a Dutch 
program that was first to defeat World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov  in a 
series of 5-minute games), CHESS GENIUS 3 (a British program that recently 
defeated Kasparov in a two-game match, where each player had 25 minutes 
to complete their moves), and the current world computer-chess champion 
from The Netherlands, CHESS MACHINE.  As many as 24 teams are expected 
to compete.  Most will use high-speed microprocessors that will be in the 
tournament hall, while others will be connected to remote supercomputers 
such as a CRAY, a Connection Machine as far away as Boston, and a Parsytec 
transputer array in Germany.

The event will take place on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong 
Kong in their Ho Sin Hang Engineering Building.  The playing hall has a 
magnificent view of Tolo Harbour and the Ma On Mountains.

The event is sponsored primarily by the IBM Corporation.  Additional support 
is being provided through the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong 
Chess Club, and the Hong Kong business community.  This long standing event 
has been held every three years according to the following schedule:
