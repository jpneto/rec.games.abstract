I'm not sure I even know Rich, so don't know upon what you're basing
that assertion. One might say that I do generally admire anyone who's
contributed to the field of promoting the playing of games of skill,
specifically for those contributions. Heavens, I even admire your
actual contributions, despite the fact that as a human being you are
intollerable.

Mark has very good designs.  I respect his designs.

I like the simplicity of most of them. I prefer a simple set
of non-contrived rules that lead to not-quite-mathematically-
perfect game. (Horror of horrors - a draw is theoretically 
possible, throw it in the bin! What nonsense - if two players
play perfectly equally well in all respects, then a draw is 
in all fairness the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>correct<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> outcome.) So I too respect a 
fair proportion of his designs.

A problem faced
here is that the world doesn't really care that Mark has good
designs.  That is a problem.  People who do designs like Mark aren't
able to make a living doing them.  The games are given away for free.
Even if Mark was much more of an agreeable personality, he still
couldn't make a living doing it.

Is anyone able to make a living from game design, apart from just
a small handful of lucky ones.
