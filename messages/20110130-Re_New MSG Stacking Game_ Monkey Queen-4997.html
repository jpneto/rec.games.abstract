Most of the Monkey Queen feedback has been extraordinarily positive, the
notable exception being Corey Clark's comment, which he entered into the
game chat of a play already completed between me and Christian:

"what a piece of shit!"

Perplexing since Corey had already described Monkey Queen as a sure winner
of the contest, and because before his comment I thought we were on
agreeable terms.

Here's a link to the game, which was in fact a particularly interesting play
of Monkey Queen:
 <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=164670&amp;place=0〈=en">http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=164670&amp;place=0〈=en</a>

Christian did surprisingly well for the first several moves into the game -
a model of how to play the opening game.  I was running out of options
faster than normal.  But Christian made the common error of going for the
kill without having enough babies on the board yet.  It can be done, yes,
but if you don't succeed, you'll be behind.  Not that it's game over at that
point, but it is a predicament.

I have no idea what's going on with Corey Clark.  First he said he would
have an entry for the stacking game contest.  Then later he bowed out,
saying he had "moved on" to other things, and no longer had time for such
nonsense.  But apparently there's still time for an impromptu critique of
Monkey Queen.

Let's just put our cards out on the table Mark. I kept wondering, why
"Why is Mark so intent on me entering this contest?" and the answer
came to me a while ago and I couldn't keep up the bloody charade much
longer. The answer is he wants me to concede that rec.games.abstract
is not broken. While I don't really give a shit about that- I may even
agree with that sentiment since the rants are no longer a daily
affair- which can be indicated by the infrequency of my posts at RGC,
I don't appreciate being used!  Sure, so you have Christian Freeling,
Cameron Browne, Dieter Stein and yourself in this contest and I'm "one
of the few who could submit a decent game". I still have no qualms
about entering this contest actually. Like I said, I don't give a
shit. You seemed more angry that I would pass up the contest than
seemed rational so I came to the above realization. But that's not the
only thing. There's the fact that you've publicly tweaked Monkey Queen
half a dozen times, something you've been contemptuous of in the past,
especially when other designers do it but do you humbly admit to  it?
Not that I can tell. You're acting as if what you have now is the
exact same product of inspiration and instinct that you had on day
one. Maybe not showing weakness is just your strategy to win this
contest, I don't know. I'll admit maybe I'm being paranoid suspecting
this agenda, maybe you're just really passionate about this contest
and want everything to be perfect but whether or not my suspicions are
valid, this is the rationale for my behavior (along with a healthy
dose of depression). IF I've wrongfully accused you of having this
agenda then I sincerely apologize.
