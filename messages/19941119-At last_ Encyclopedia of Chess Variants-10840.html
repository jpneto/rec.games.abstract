THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHESS VARIANTS

Compiled by David Pritchard


- A comprehensive collection of games related to, derived from or
inspired by chess. Designed to entertain as well as to inroduce
many excellent yet largely unknown games, The Encycolpedia of Chess
Variants will also serve as a reference work on chess variants - the
first book in any language to attempt a comprehensive survey of the
subject.

- The variants, which are arranged alphabetically and collected from
all over the world, date from ancient times to the present day.
About half can be played using an ordinary chess set. Popular
variants such as Kriegspiel, Losing Chess and Progressive Chess are
treated in depth with origins, history, rules, analysis, hints on
play and annotated games, many between well known players.

- There are up-to-the-minute sections on Burmese, Chinese, Japanese,
Korean and Thai chess with guides to translating indigenous notation.
Other regional variants are also covered together with the older
forms of chess. Proprietary (commercial) variants number 160, many of
them still on the market. Three- and four-handed chess, space chess,
hexagonal chess, and mini-chess are well represented. A wealth of
new boards, new pieces, new rules, offer an immensely rich and largely
unexplored field for researchers, analysts and problem composers.

- Here are games that take just a few minutes to play, others that may
take a few hours. The variety is extraordinary: Alice, Bughouse, Choiss,
Dragonfly, Enochian, Falcon-Hunter, Gay ... and so on through the
alphabet, a cavalcade of the imagination.

- A book that is as exhilarating as it is different - a must for your 
library.
