Are you sure you mean ONAG and not Winning Ways? ONAG has been out of
print for a long time and I haven't heard of a recent new edition.
There is a copy of some edition in our school's library, but I don't
know what edition it is offhand. Winning Ways is coming out with a new
edition and I think the first book is supposed to be available now, though
I don't know this for sure.
If you really are sure you want the second edition of ONAG I can look
to see what edition we have in our library. Though I wouldn't be able to
tell you what's different. If you had something specific you were looking
for I could check on it.

A new edition of ONAG was published a year or two ago.
