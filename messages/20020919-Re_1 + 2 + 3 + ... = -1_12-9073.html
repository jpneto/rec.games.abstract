|&gt; These are pretty cool ... 
|&gt; &gt;  F = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 +...

Yeah thanks.


|&gt; Let me try one:
|&gt;   L = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 11 + 18 + 29 + 47 + 76 + 123 + 199 + 322 + 521 +...

Well it "comes out OK" but you're sure making it hard for yourself!

|&gt; And so since F = -2,        I get:   L = -3.

You can get this result directly with the same sort of grouping I did for F:-

L = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 11 + 18 + 29 + 47 + 76 + 123 + 199 + 322 + 521 +...
  = 1   + 7     + 18       +47     + 123      + 322 + ...
  =   4     + 11     + 29     + 76      + 199 ...

...that's grouping in pairs the two alternative ways.   Adding the two series...

2L = 1   + 4 + 7 + 11 + 18 + ...    = L - 3

so that's   L = -3   right off.


If you want to mix in F as well, then just subtract F from L term by term, to...

L - F = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 ...
      = 1 + F
                    whence   F = -2   as before.

It's quite remarkable that all these fast-and-loose nonsense operations
maintain considerable internal consistency, (as is explained by the realm
of divergent-series summability methods); BUT faith in this (as much else)
can be dangerous, so beware here...

|&gt; One more question: if we rearrange and regroup the terms of these things
|&gt; some other way, you're telling me we'll always get the same answers?

No.  There's a limit to how much silliness one can do before bending the
sillystem to breaking point.  For series of positive terms, it's usually
OK to group or re-arrange terms as long as it is done "uniformly" down 
the line, and not in a variable-width manner.   It is a bit more dodgy 
even to shift a whole series one place to the right, though it has been
done above several times.   But getting into alternating series is fraught!

Cheers!
