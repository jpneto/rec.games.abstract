Your presumption, Christian.  Not mine.  In fact, it's the smart players who
fall into the cyclic traps.  Unwittingly.   Paradoxically.

You've "intuited" all these "soft finite" games with your usual, total
absence of evidence.  What happens in Volo if you extend a group linearly,
forming a region and capturing groups, and you later release said region *in
order to* form a different region?  Now your "soft finitude" doesn't look so
soft, Christian.  You can't know all the ways players could stumble into a
cyclic trap in Volo, or any other game for that matter.  Aren't you
spreading your "intuition" a little thin, delegating all these "soft finite"
games, including Volo?

Smart players are smart and stupid players are stupid.  What's all the fuss
about stupid players?
