Solution to Mancala Challenge, part 1:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Here is a mancala game and a couple challenges.

The board is 2x6 with a store on each end.

                         North
                    f  e  d  c  b  a
North's holes ----&gt;  4  4  4  4  4  4
North's store --&gt; 0                    0 &lt;-- South's store
                    4  4  4  4  4  4  &lt;---- South's holes
                    A  B  C  D  E  F
                         South

The player begins by lifting all the seeds from one of the
holes (A, B, C, D, E or F for South, and a, b, c, d, e, or f
for North) and then drops them one at a time counter-
clockwise in all the other holes, including the player's own
store but excluding the opponent's store. This lifting and
sowing of all the seeds in a hole is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lap<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

There are five possible outcomes to each lap. They are:

1) If the last seed of a lap falls in the player's store,
  the player gets another turn to start a lap from any of his
  or her own holes. There is no limit to the number of extra
  turns.

2) If the last seed of a lap falls in any hole other that
  the store with at least one seed in it, the player lifts
  them all and continues sowing. There is no limit to the
  number of laps per turn.

3) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the
  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opponent's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> side of the board, the turn is over.

4) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the
  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>player's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> side of the board, and the hole directly across
  from it on the opponent's side is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>empty<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, the turn is over.

5) If the last seed of a lap falls in an empty hole on the
  *player'* side of the board, and the hole directly across
  from it on the opponent's side has at least one seed in it,
  all seeds in both holes are captured and placed in the
  player's store, ending the turn.

Also, if you start a lap from a hole with more 12 seeds, you
do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> skip over the starting hole on your way around. In
other words, the 13th seed ends up back in the hole it
started in. (This is the opposite of the rule in Wari.)

The game ends when all the seeds are captured. A player who
has no seeds passes. You are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> compelled to give your
opponent a seed to move. The player with the most seeds is
the winner.


The trouble with this version is that the first player has
enough options to make it possible to win before the second
player even takes a turn! Of course, when we were kids, we
played a lot before I figured this out.

Here is the challenge:

  Find the maximum number of seeds the first player can
  capture without the second player getting a turn. Give
  the sequence of moves and the total captured.

  What is the maximum number of seeds the first player
  can capture regardless of the moves the second player
  makes. Is it possible to force a 48 to nothing win?

Paul Colley wrote a program in C that found the ulitmate solution to
the first part of the challenge, finding the greatest number of seeds
the first player could capture before second player even gets a turn.
In his output, the board is 'unfolded', that is, the board is printed
as a line of 13 numbers: the 6 holes on first player's side, the first 
player's store and the 6 holes on the second player's side. The second 
player's store is not used. Then holes on the first player's side are 
labeled 0 to 5 from left to right.

Here's Paul:

The result is:  You can score 45 (!) on your first move.  Numbering
your bins from 0 through 5 (with your store as comming after bin 6),
the choice of bins to use are:

           5 2 1 4 0 0 4 4 5 0 2 3 5 1 5 5 4 1 5 0 5 2 5 4 5 3

I manually checked the result on my mancala board. Then I memorized the
sequence and played the game three times with the neighbor's kid. I let
him go first the first two games. I couldn't resist.



Starting the game with 48 seeds on the board, the first player scores
45 in the first turn! The final score, however is 45 to 3. The question
of whether or not it is possible to force a 48 to nothing win is still 
open.

This game is still commonly played many places. Typically, the board is
2 rows of x holes, with x seeds per hole, 5 &lt; x &lt; 11. I believe regardless
of which of theses boards you use, the first player has a one turn landslide
win.
