Never mind the tradition of games lasting weeks or even months. One of if not the most famous Go matches was played at 40 hours per player, over the course of six months. I've always felt more comfortable with longer time controls, because it shifts the measure away from how well I manage this arbitrary resource, and onto how long I myself can concentrate without getting distracted, losing the train of thought, or getting impatient and making a reckless move. I do understand the rationale behind time-controls, but I don't think they make a game inherently more interesting.

Even so, there's always at least some amount of meta-gaming. That 6-month game had some controversial moments when the players used or abused the way that adjournments were managed. It just comes with the territory. Still way better than Badminton's tournament structure that incentivized intentionally losing. Who managed to fuck up that royally?
