There are some opinions which argue that Irish game Fidchell was not a
Tafl-style game. One argument suggests that it was not any game that is
currently known. The other theory is that it was a British variant of
Latrunculorum. Although it is recorded as early as the first century
B.C., Latrunculorum itself is a subject of debate among classical
scholars. A number of Roman-era game boards in both square and
rectangular shapes and in varying sizes are believed to be examples of
it...

I'd like to see who is doing the theorising. I'm afraid I have a low
opinion of the expertise of (some) archaeologists and historians in
general when it comes to describing games; there has been too much of a
"there are lots of bits and a flat bit of wood so it's a game and must be
chess - look I have found some dice!" about.   ;-(

Gwyddbwyll" and &gt;Tawlbyrdd" are both referred to in Welsh sagas.

Fortunately, a manuscript from 1587 in the Welsh National Library solves
the mystery in regard to Tawlbwrdd. The description is unmistakably a
Tafl-style game set on an 11x11 grid: &gt;The king in the center of the
board and twelve men in the place next to him, and twenty-four lie in
wait to capture him" -with the 24 attackers equally spaced on the four
edges of the board. The term Gwyddbwyll seems to be older than Tawlbwrdd.

Is this where the "it's seems to be older than the Vikings so it must be
the previous civilisation ie Roman" comes in? Of course the Britons could
never have developed a game of their own (or have traded with Scandinavia
before the main settlements).   [cynic!]

Part of the theory in regard to Latrunculorum is that Gwyddbwyll was its
Welsh counterpart, and that Tawlbwrdd may have been imported by Norse
and/or Saxon invaders and therefore gradually replaced Gwyddbwyll.

Whose theory? Any leads?

P.S. we sell our own Fidchell game directly based on the Ballinderry
game board if you'll excuse a commercial note...

It's only those of us interested enough to make and play that do the real
historical digging!
