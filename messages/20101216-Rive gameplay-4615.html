Rive is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> unusual game to play.  The most striking aspect is how
teensy the board is.  I've played three times on a 3x3x5.  29 cells.  The
move totals were 52, 81 and 122 - broadly variable and <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>way<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more than the
number of cells.  Rive is a full size game on a tiny board.

The other startling element of Rive gameplay is that you can get completely
wiped out, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>a number of times<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and still come back and win.  Subtle
observation: each successive comeback is increasingly difficult because
you're going up against successively larger groups of all enemy stones.

The first couple of times I played Rive, on variously sized boards, I was
just hanging on, trying to make legal moves, and frequently being corrected
on illegal moves.  Now I'm just starting to glimpse some rhyme and reason to
the game.  Some fuzzy "tactics" are beginning to take shape.  I think you
want separate clusters of your stones near the center of the board so it's
harder for your opponent to form a big, centralized group of his stones,
shaking off your outlying stones.
