So, the "Y" state is expanded into 19 different states internally (if I
have counted correctly), 10 of which are terminal, and 9 of which are
not yet "long enough" to end the game.  These states do not have any
loopiness, so they can be analyzed normally.

This seems like a very good way in theory, but in practice, the number
of states would expand tremendously.

Yep, you got that right.  Welcome to the world of artificial intelligence.

Aha! I seem to have found a much simpler way, if my logic is correct. 
Let me know if I have reasoned incorrectly.

...

In this way, I have addressed this complex-valued draw-by-repetition
problem with negligible additional effort and at the cost of only some
additional memory (for an intermediary copy of the unsettled values).

Are there any holes in my reasoning?  Can other cases of state
expansion in game trees be solved similarly?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I would say that you have successfully convinced yourself that you can
deal with loopy positions algorithmically, but that you are fooling
yourself that it's simpler.  As far as I can tell, the "intermediary
copies" that you are referring to are simply dynamically-generated
versions of the "expanded states" that I proposed above.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually, the intermediary copies of the state is one static copy of
each state/position which is unsettled.  Since there are no more
unsettled positions than positions in the entire database, this is
obviously no more than doubling the size of the original database for
a temporary period of time.  Say for a 10GB endgame database, you will
never need more than 10GB of this so-called intermediary storage.

This additional step I have proposed to the normal retrograde analysis
algorithm has negligible time since it is simply a comparison of each
of the n nodes/positions in the original database with each of its
children and then updating the intermediary copy, which is definitely
a O(n) operation.

Now of course, my reasoning could be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> wrong and for some
reason this algorithm I have described will not work.  But that's the
type of comment I am soliciting.

Note again, that I am trying to only address one aspect of loopiness. 
That where the position can statically determine a unique
game-theoretic value when a game ends due to repetition in that
position.  No move history is required to determine this value.

If you want an example of a real-world game to use as an example, take
some variants of the game Awari.  This abstract game sees 48 identical
piece moved about in 12 containers (half assigned to each player) and
has in some rule variants the feature that a vicious cycle ends the
game (when either there are insufficient to total forces to effect
further captures or the pieces are in such a configuration that each
side can move in such a way during his turn so as to prevent the other
player from capturing any of his pieces) and that when such a vicious
cycle occurs, each player gets to keep the game pieces that happen to
be in his 6 containers.  Since number of game pieces possessed by each
player determines the score in the game (game-theoretic value), and
since the number of pieces in each of the 12 containers and in the
players' possession at any point in the game can be statically
evaluated without considering the history of the game, clearly this is
an example of my more general case of draw-by-repetition values
depending on position when the draw-by-repetition occurs.  Also, in
this example game, these positions where "vicious cycles" occur are
not necessarily end nodes in the game tree, but only loops where it is
preferable to remain in the loop than to exit (for example exiting by
moving so as to allow the opponent to make some more captures)...  I'm
not sure that giving my problem a concrete target helps to address the
correctness of my modification to the retrograde analysis algorithm,
however.
