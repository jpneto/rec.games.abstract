|&gt; How do you come up with just one shortest winning path in Hex? It
|&gt; looks to me that an NxN grid would have N shortest winning paths for
|&gt; each player. Do you agree?
|
|Yes, you are correct.  However more shortest paths go through the
|center point on an odd x odd board than any other point.

Ah, you're right, in fact there are a lot more than N shortest
distance paths. But that is very different from saying there is
just one shortest path.


|&gt; | There is only one
|&gt; |shortest connection path in Hex, as I mentioned.  This path is shared
|&gt; |by both players.  An obvious deduction is that control of the center
|&gt; |is paramount, whether you define "center" as the center point (in
|&gt; |which case the first move player simply claims it), or the center
|&gt; |small area (in which case the first move player easily dominates
|&gt; |it).
|&gt;
|&gt; What do you mean by "paramount"? And what does the center have to do
|&gt; with the shortest connection path?
|&gt;
|
|I'm getting a little beyond my purview with Hex strategy and the
|importance of the center, since, as I've admitted, I've only played Hex
|once.  Allow me to quote from a recognized expert, David Boll:
|
|  ") The opening
|
|  If you're the first player, the opening move is easy:  open in the
|center
|  hex.  The second person has a few semi reasonable choices..."
|
|This is from David's FAQ:

|This I believe is common wisdom among Hex experts.

The center is a strong first move if you play without the pie rule,
certainly. But so are lots of other moves. All the Hex experts I know
use the pie rule, of course.

|&gt; |I'm not claiming that Box Hex is free of first (or second) move
|&gt; |advantage.  No game is.  My claim is that with Box Hex's four shortest
|&gt; |paths (two for each player), all of which travel around the center
|&gt; |(not through it), the simple symmetry of regular Hex is defeated,
|&gt; |and the overwhelming emphasis on regular Hex's center area is
|&gt; |greatly alleviated, as is Hex's powerful first move advantage.
|&gt;
|&gt; How does changing the importance of the central
|&gt; area have any effect at all on the first move advantage?
|
|Let me ask you this:  Why do <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> think Hex has such a powerful first
|move advantage?  Is it because of the "tempo"?  All turn based games
|have tempo.  Why would Hex be so bowled over by tempo?

Are you referring to any specific size grid? My preferred size these
days is 19x19, which can be played on the Little Golem turn-based
server, as well as Kurnik, the most popular real-time server:

On 19x19, the advantage of the first move without swap is much less,
but it's still there. Playing without the pie rule results in a less
interesting game. I'm not strong enough to guaranteee a win
if I move first wihout swap on such a large grid, or even on a
smaller grid, but I'm very glad the pie rule is in place, because it
makes a fairer game.

Other games, such as chess for example, have a significant percentage
of draws between strong players. The first move advantage DOES have
an effect among the top-level players. It may be a matter of just a
few percentage points, but at that level of play, that's a lot.
If chess players were to adopt the pie rule, I suspect that better
than 95% of all games played between grandmasters this way would end
in a draw. As you well know, Hex cannot end in a draw.

I posted once on rec.games.go, asking why not use the pie rule
instead of komi. The answer was, the pie rule is too crude for Go.
Any initial move along an edge should not be swapped, and any other
move should (with one possible exception, which I forget.) Komi, by
the way, is essentially a scoring handicap given to the 2nd player,
to assure both players are statistically equally likely to win.

So, if you are asking me why Hex would be so different, my answer is
that it is not fundamentally different in this respect. On a small
11x11 grid, the game is much shallower than chess, or Go on the same
size grid. So naturally, the first move advantage would be more
significant. But this is not an inherent attribute of Hex per se.

And I notice, you did not answer my question. How would changing the
importance of the central region have any effect on the advantage of
the first move?

BTW that square Hex variant might be regarded as an overhead view
of a pyramid. Maybe that fits your definition of essentially
three dimensional...?
