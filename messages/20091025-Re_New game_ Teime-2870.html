...is complete nonsense!

The board is almost certain to fill up with both players
getting to create a "Teime", namely one connecting edges A,B,D
and the other edges D,F,A.   (Marking edges cyclically, as obvious.)

That is, both create a winning position, and the one who does it first
wins the game.  It becomes a mere race.  Which we hate.  And in
particular, it essentially becomes a race to sprint across from
one side to the opposite one, in the above case A to D,
(then, in this game, join up to a third).

Oops! Seems like I should have thought a bit more before claiming my
game's drawlessness. Anyway, as this game gets rid of that weird
corners/sides distinction, I still prefer it over Havannah, specially
if you also consider loops as winning formations. Moreover,
"teimes" (or however you want to call them) are harder to make than
both Havannah's forks and bridges, making this hypothetical game a bit
(just a bit, unfortunately) less race-like than Freeling's popular one.
