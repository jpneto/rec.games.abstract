One serious problem is that Abalone assumess the players want to win
and doesn't have a ko rule. This makes a strong defense very hard to
beat. You would need to judge how aggressive to make the computer
player.

Wow.  Teaching a computer ko etiquette...Take the easy solution:  Be
aggressive.

Seriously, though, if you're going for playing pleasure, you might want
to randomize the computer's persistence.  If you're going for computer
vs. computer (you said this was a contest?), i'd test the computer against
itself and see what it looks like for different measures of persistence.
(How do you measure persistence, though?  Flag certain behaviors after
a certain amount of time, or measure position values differently?)

How about the representation problem?  The best i've been able to come up
with (after speculation about the way arrays work best on computers, and
speculation that the representation should be as efficient as possible to
find moves quickly) is the following:  *'s are the board, and .'s are
dead space:

    ....*****
    ...******
    ..*******
    .********
    *********
    ********.
    *******..
    ******...
    *****....

Moves along the vertical, horizontal, and right-left diagonal are legal.
I'm not sure if this minimizes special-casing, though, because you still
have to check for the dead space.  I guess i haven't given it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much
thought.  It just seems like that should be the best board representation.
Heh.  Maybe just because i came up with it...

Or is this a common way to represent hex maps as arrays?
