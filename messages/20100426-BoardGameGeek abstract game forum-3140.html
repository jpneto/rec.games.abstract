BoardGameGeek started an abstract games forum and at first it seemed
totally stupid.  Fools were rushing in, basically trying to establish
that anything goes regarding what qualifies as an abstract game.

It's a big crowd and some interesting discussions did eventually
develop.  Over the last couple of days though there was an uprising of
stupidity.  Brainless shit Vintermann for example was most recently
making the point that the pie rule confers an advantage to Player 1
because "he can select an opening he has studied extensively from both
sides."  What an ass!

After a torrent of such idiocy from Vintermann and others, the only
possible response becomes, "This discussion is ridiculous".  Then I
get this faggotty "geekmail" from Octavian telling me that I'm
provoking people.  Fuck you, provoking people!

The beyotch hand slap was the last straw in what was already becoming
a nuisance.  It kind of sucks because there was a glimmer of hope for
a time, and some interesting conversations did take place.  But then a
profound, group retardation set in like a San Francisco fog bank.
Defeated by sheer stupidity.

In response to a "geekmail" from twixter ("I want you to know I don't
enjoy reading many of your posts"), Read this: tough shit!
