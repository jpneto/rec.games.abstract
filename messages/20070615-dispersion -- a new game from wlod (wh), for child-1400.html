Consider a finite (or compact, or totally
bounded) metric space (X d), and a
real constant C &gt; 0.

Players alternatively (on their move) select
a point  p_i \in X,  which has distance &gt; C
from all previously selected points p_j, j &lt; i.

If you have selected the last point, so that
your opponent cannot make a move, then
you WON (the negative, miser version, once
again is possible, it gives a similar but different
game).

****

EXAMPLES  There are three popular distance
========  functions in R^2,  d_m d_e, and d++,
related to the max, the Euclidean one, and related
to the sum respectively. Select one of them. For
small children d_M and d_+ are preferable to d_e.
Anyway, call it  d.  Next, on the graph paper
select a bounded region  G -- regular or irregular, as
you like.  Define  X := G \cap Z^2. Select a positive
constant C (for small children let it be a small, natural
number like 2 or 3). Now play the game to you heart
desire.

Ebjoy,

Wlod
