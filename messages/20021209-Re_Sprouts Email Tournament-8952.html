In all the abstract games which I enjoy, you can play so as to try to 
improve your position.

In sprouts, either you are able to analyse the position fully (when 
either you know that you have a won position, or you know that your 
opponent has a won position but you can hope that he goes wrong), or you 
can't and the move that you make might as well be random.

Can you persuade me otherwise?

That's a great summary of the old view of sprouts.  I remember many
years ago at a chess tournament the math professor David Sumner
expressed exactly the same idea.  Lately, though, the concept of
"survivors" has given the game a strong strategical element.  A
survivor is a live spot in an exhausted position.

A live spot is either a "cannibal" or a "ghost".  A cannibal is a live
spot with 0 or two lines attached.  A ghost is a live spot with one
line attached.
Any sprouts move must change a position with an even number of
cannibals to a position with an odd number of cannibals, and vice
versa.  Since a survivor is a cannibal, the player to move in any
position can count the number of cannibals and instantly know whether
he needs an even or an odd number of survivors in the final position.

Play revolves around trying to get an even or an odd number of
survivors.  As the position gets more and more divided up, players try
to extract desirable numbers of survivors from different sections of
the position.  Often there will be a position or subposition in which
one player will try to maximize the number of survivors and the other
player will try to minimize the number of survivors.  Sometimes there
will be cases in which a player succeeds too well, minimizes or
maximizes too much.  There is a lot of room for experience and
intuition in estimating and trying to influence how many survivors a
position or subposition will yield.

A surprisingly useful notion is the concept of a "universal trap" or
UT.  A UT is a subposition consisting of two communicating spots, each
with 0 lines attached, and such that either (1) neither spot
communicates with any other spot or (2) both spots communicate with
one other spot, a spot with two lines attached and which itself
communicates with at least one more spot.  We generally try not to
move to a UT because the second person to move to a UT can determine
whether the UT will yield an even or an odd number of survivors.

These ideas and some related ideas explained on the website
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.geocities.com/chessdp">www.geocities.com/chessdp</a> help make the game a lot of fun to play from
the first move on.  Various rules of thumb give the player a good
strategical orientation immediately, and he is able to make
meaningful, goal-oriented moves.

In the kind of position which you describe in which a player knows he
is lost, it's the same as in chess.  If the player knows his opponent
has the technique and knowledge to certainly win, he resigns. 
Otherwise he tries to make problems for his opponent, using strategy
and tactics.  But most of sprouts play occurs in difficult, unclear
positions.  One player or the other invariably resigns long before the
position is exhausted.  Beginners are often amazed how early
resignation comes.  In fact, resignation usually comes long before
meaningful, nonrandom play would have even begun in the old days
before the survivor concept.

I hope this diatribe has been a reasonable answer to your question!
