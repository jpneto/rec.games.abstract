 Furthermore, chess at a high level has never been about traps, so it 
seems likely that the trappy variations you hypothesize would only be an 
issue among weak amateurs, who, honestly, make enough mistakes that the 
advantage of the first move means less.

I guess it depends on what you mean by "trap." It seems you regard a trap
as something high level players don't use between themselves. My latest
issue of New in Chess (2003 nr. 6) features an exciting game between
Viswanathan Anand and Viktor Bologan. Anand sprang an opening novelty which
he had prepared last year, which led to his victory over Bologan. I would
call that novelty a high-level trap. You can call it whatever you like.

I think there's a difference between the typical opening trap (a 
tactical shot that's a standard part of the opening that might be missed 
by someone not familiar with the opening) and a theoretical novelty, 
that is, a well-prepared new line of an opening (for which the person 
playing it has studied well but which the opponent must work out over 
the board).

I think that the former (traps) are rarely fallen for in GM games, while 
the letter (theoretical novelties) can be a big part of GM chess. I'd 
prefer to think of those as separate things.
