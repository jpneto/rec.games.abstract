A little background for those who have forgotten, or more likely never heard
of, Bill Taylor.  Every so often he shows up at rec.games.abstract to call
me a troll and accuse me of destroying the group.

The troll part is ironic because, if it implies irrelevance, nobody could
possibly be less relevant than Bill Taylor.  The group destroyer part? 
Maybe there is some truth to that, and here's why.  The "group", as
underachiever Bill Taylor refers to himself and his cadre of ass sucking
nitwits led by Harald Korneliussen, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>needed<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be destroyed.  It was just a
bunch of self congratulatory, moronic snots.  There was no discussion of
abstract games going on except for nitwit Mogensen's Nim variants, and there
was no design of abstract games going on, except by me and Leroy Quet.  All
of my games were actively ignored in favor of nitwit Mogensen's Nim variants
because I hadn't "earned" the respect of "great mind" Bill Taylor.  Earn
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>this<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> you fat sack of shit, lol

The day I arrived here, Taylor jumped onto my coattails, ripping off my
games right and left, and wouldn't get off until the day I told him to get
the fuck out of the group, which he did.  Some "great mind", lol.  It took
his followers some time to catch on that their fat, fearless leader wasn't
coming back and then they got the fuck out out too.

It's sad that Taylor's ouster destroyed his life, but he was hogging up a
valuable Internet resource to use for his own personal social club.  He had
to go.  Now he's like a lost soul wandering the Internet.  "Mark Steere the
troll destroyed me....  Now I have nowhere to go.....", lol.
