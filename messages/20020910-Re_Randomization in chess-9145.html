What I mean is a random way to produce positions that seem to be nearby to humans, possibly increasing the strength of one side or the
other. For example, one could declare that in 5 moves, a pawn would be added to one side or the other, somewhere on the second, third,
or fourth ranks. Then playing out one position might reveal that it seems to win an average of 0.3 points, whereas another move might
win 0.2 points. Of course, this does not guarrantee that the first position was stronger than the second, but it would provide
feedback that I believe would be valuable to people playing ordinary chess.

It might be that the randomization method should depend on the position, e.g., if the tactics are tight in one part of the board, one
could randomly shift undeveloped pieces in another part of the board.

Hi Douglas,

I'm not sure I quite understand the your examples here. I think
there are probably many ways, including these ideas, that could
be interesting to play around with. I'm not quite sure what you
mean by random in your description.

Instead of looking at the specific position in ordinary chess, one might look at many related positions, imagining that there is a
probability distribution over that set of positions, and that your goal is to maximize your expected performance.

In fact, the distribution could extend to the parameters, e.g., the thinking time allowed, or the noise added to each side's computer
evaluation in the rollout.

It might not tell me anything about the actual positions, and in fact, I hope it doesn't. What I want to do is to know what ought to feel
like a strong move, not to be told that the moves are equally strong since the computer can see that the position is still a win after each.
If you want, you can imagine that my imperfect understanding of the game means that there is a subjective probability distribution anyway.

For starters, how would these
positions and pieces be selected for these moves or changes in a
game's set up or given piece positioning?

It might depend on the actual position, and the results might be hard to compare between decisions, even if they seem conclusive for a
particular pair of moves. The variations should not have immediate direct tactical effects on the differences between the plays, e.g., such
that in the first position, 60% of the variations would immediately drop a piece, whereas from the other position only 30% would. Such
tactical variations might have their place if you were practicing to play speed chess against a computer, I supposed, but I'm looking for
more than that.
