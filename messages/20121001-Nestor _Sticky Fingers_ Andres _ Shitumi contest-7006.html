Nestor "Sticky Fingers" Andres was clearly shown to have ripped off at least 3 games, that we know of, from real designers.  He lied about each game in turn, saying it was a coincidence, until the coincidences mounted to the point he couldn't face the public.  Nestor is a fraud, a swine, and an embarrassment.

Don't support the upcoming Shitumi contest at iggc.  Arty complained on facebook about someone running off with his wife's music.  How is that different from Nestor running off with real designers' games?  

We need to pull together on the issue of integrity in game design.  Nestor needs to be banned, not supported.
