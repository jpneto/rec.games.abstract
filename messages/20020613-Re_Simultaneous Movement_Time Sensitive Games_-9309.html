So what I'm asking you, dear reader, is for interesting games (from an AI
standpoint) with simultaneous movement or time-sensitive games in which
several pieces have the option of moving on any given turn.

Have a look at Diplomacy - <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.diplom.org">http://www.diplom.org</a>, rec.games.diplomacy

Every piece moves at the same time and all players move their units
simultaneously each turn.  It's a pretty simple game, but it would be
a big challenge to treat mathematically.

Of course, there's the Prisoner's Dilemma game, which might be a bit
more accessible from a mathematical point of view, but not so much of
a challenge as a game like Diplomacy.

Send me an email if you want to know more.  Sounds like you could
write a very interesting thesis indeed on these lines, good luck.
