There is a little-known but interesting-looking game, mentioned
occasionally in books, and rarely on servers, called "AGON"

It involves having 6 or 7 pieces each, one being a Queen,
all of which can move just one step at a time on a large-ish
hex-hex board.  When pieces are suitably surrounded, they
can be captured but immediately replaced somewhere on the rim,
at the capturer's choice.  The ultimate goal is to get your
seven pieces onto the seven centre cells.

I have never played it, a few experiments suggesting it could
be quite a long game.

However, with the recnet flurry of activity here, (involving
inter-translating quad &amp; hex games), it has occurred to me that
a nice quad-version could be made.  It also naturally falls out
with a smaller number of pieces, with quicker goals, and thus
very suitable for chessboard play!   So that's all a plus.

Here it is.  If anyone wants to try an email game, write to me at

(sorry I have to write it that way to avoid the stupid poster!)


QUAGON
======
Played on a chessboard with 4 pawns to each player.
Initial layout can be negotiated, but something like...

- - X - - O - -          - - - - - - - *
- - - - - - - -          - - - - - - * X
O - - - - - - X          - - * - - - - *   Legal moves for
- - - - - - - - start    - - X * - - - -   various pieces
- - - - - - - - layout   - - * - - - - -   shown here.
X - - - - - - O          - - - - - - * -
- - - - - - - -          - - - - - * X -
- - O - - X - -          - - - - - - - -


- - X - - O - -               - - - - - - - *
- - - - - - - -                - - - - - - * X
O - - - - - - X               - - * - - - - *    Legal moves for
- - - - - - - -   start      - - X * - - - -   various pieces
- - - - - - - -   layout   - - * - - - - -    shown here.
X - - - - - - O               - - - - - - * -
- - - - - - - -                - - - - - * X -
- - O - - X - -               - - - - - - - -

....is suggested.  One piece is moved each turn, to an empty
orthogonally adjacent cell. Pieces may move inward, or tangentially
on the same large square surrounding the centre, but not outwardly.

If a piece is captured by "custodian capture", i.e.  - X O X - ,
where O is captured, then it is removed and replaced on
the outer rim, somewhere at the capturer's discretion.

The winner is whoever gets his four pieces simultaneously
on the central four cells.
