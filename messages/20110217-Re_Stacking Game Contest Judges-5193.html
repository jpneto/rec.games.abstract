It must be hard to find judges when one of the criteria is that they
must be sufficiently deferential to Mark Steere :) If you're a game
site programmer, having a couple of Mark's games is not enough: No, if
new ones are not added in an acceptable tempo, that must mean he's
totally unsuitable!

Even Freeling has disqualified Dave Dyer for neglecting to implement
any of his games... why don't you save yourself some time, quit all
this tedious jury-rigging and vote among yourselves?

(I must admit I was amused by Mark's frothing when he found out I
could theoretically vote in the competition as originally proposed.
But he need not worry: I won't interfere. I'm sure the prize of honest
BGG reviews will push Mark a bit up there... last time I checked, just
about every participant in this competition has a game ranked higher
than all of Mark's, so it shouldn't take a lot!)
