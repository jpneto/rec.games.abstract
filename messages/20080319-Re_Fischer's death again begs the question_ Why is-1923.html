<br>If you welsh on an agreement, no matter how unethical, the word
<br>will go round, and no one will make such a deal with you ever again.
<br>(Well, they will, but you'll have to agree to lose one or more tosses
<br>without actually making the toss to get back to making even deals.)
<br>Meanwhile the other players are making the deals to their advantage,
<br>and as you are frozen out, your disadvantage.
<br>
<br>And chess players are quite capable of working all that out. Even the
<br>ones who haven't read Axelrod.
