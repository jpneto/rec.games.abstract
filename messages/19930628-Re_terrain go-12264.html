Next, has anybody worked on a version of go where terrain would be a
factor? I'm sure you all remember Feudal, a chess type variant with
terrain as a factor in movement.  It was a terrible game.  But would
something using terrain, a grid map, let's say, with special connections
along roads, rivers used as edges, bridges as choke points, maybe towns
worth double , be playable, or even workable?

Not exactly, but there is the Swiss set of funny go boards designed
for the 1984 European Go Championship. I copied one by hand, the map
of Switzerland. In the plains there were many connections, in the
mountains only a few. Also, some moves along the border produced a
live group in one move. The Ing rules (stones and spaces count as
territory) were needed for counting. Other funnies included a board
with a trolley with one line of stones in the middle which moved
every other move. No, I don't have a copy of that.
