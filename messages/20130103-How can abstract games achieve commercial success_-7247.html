I don't think there's anything amazing about the games that have achieved commercial success. Some executive selected them for national distribution and a national advertising campaign.   I suspect that Hex has been played a lot more than Othello online, but Othello has made a lot more money because it's at Toys R Us.  The reason may be as simple as a square board being more marketable or "shelvable" than a rhombus board.
