    INTRODUCTION

***********************


TANBO IS LIKE GO
================
Tanbo requires a Go board and Go stones.  As in Go, players take turns 
adding their stones to the board, and occasionally a group of stones 
is removed.


TANBO IS NOT LIKE GO
====================
In spite of its similarity to Go, Tanbo is basically a different 
game.  For example, there is no score in Tanbo.  The object is to 
completely destroy your opponent.  


TANBO IS A GAME OF ROOTS
========================
Tanbo crudely models a system of plant roots.  Roots which are 
growing, competing for space, and dying.  In beginner play, the roots 
grow much as the roots in a garden. Over time, the roots become shrewd 
and calculating.

FIGURES A - D are excerpts from a novice game.  FIGURE A is the 
initial configuration.  FIGURES B AND C show roots growing and 
competing for space.  In FIGURE D, white has won by eliminating the 
eight black roots.

    RULES AND OBJECT

***********************


EQUIPMENT
=========
Tanbo requires a 19 by 19 Go board, 180 white Go stones, and 181 black 
Go stones.  One player takes ownership of the white stones and becomes 
"white".  The other player is "black".  In the diagrams, white is "o" 
and black is "#".


INITIAL SETUP
=============
Initially, each player has 8 stones on the board as shown in Figure A.
The stones are interspersed and evenly spaced over the entire board.


BASIC MOVES
===========
After setting up this initial configuration, black makes the first
move.  (A "move" will always mean adding exactly one stone to the
board.  Stones are never actually moved from one point to another on 
the board.)  Next white makes a move, and the players continue to take 
turns adding their stones to the board until one player wins.

A newly added stone must "connect" to exactly one stone of the same 
color, which is already on the board.  Two points "connect" if they 
are horizontally or vertically adjacent.  Diagonally adjacent points 
do not connect.  Several examples of legal and illegal moves appear 
in the following sections.

Players are not allowed to pass.  You must add exactly one stone to 
the board during your turn.


  FIGURE E: EXAMPLES OF LEGAL AND ILLEGAL MOVES FOR WHITE.

LEGAL MOVES CONNECT TO EXACTLY ONE STONE OF THE SAME COLOR
==========================================================
In FIGURE E, points B19, A15, L17, H12 are examples of legal moves for
white.  Each of these moves connects to exactly one white stone, 
already on the board.


ILLEGAL MOVES THAT DONT CONNECT TO ANY STONES OF THE SAME COLOR
===============================================================
Points Q13, H9, M10, S10 are examples of illegal moves for white.  
These moves don't connect to any white stones.


ILLEGAL MOVES THAT CONNECT TO 2 OR MORE STONES OF SAME COLOR
============================================================
Points E6, P7, F2, H2 in FIGURE E are examples of illegal moves for 
white.  These moves are illegal for white because they each connect to 
two or more white stones already on the board.  

Point E6 for example is an illegal move for white because it connects 
to two white stones; one white stone is directly above point E6 and 
the other is directly below point E6.

Point F2 is an illegal move for white because it connects to four 
white stones: above, below, to the left, and to the right of point F2.


ROOTS
=====
By adding stones in this manner, the players form "roots" (A root is a 
group of interconnected stones of the same color.)  In FIGURE B, roots 
are just beginning to form.  As the roots grow larger, they compete 
for limited growing space.

In FIGURE C, there are still 16 roots on the board.  After a few 
games, players can easily discern the individual roots.

When a single root becomes so constricted that it can no longer grow, 
the entire root is immediately removed from the board.  The 
surrounding roots can then grow into the area vacated by the removed 
root.  (Sometimes two or more roots will run out of growing space 
simultaneously.  This is discussed separately, in detail below.)

In FIGURE D, white has won the game by eliminating the eight black 
roots.  (See OBJECT OF THE GAME.)

IMPOSSIBLE FORMATIONS
=====================
The rules for adding stones make it impossible for certain types of 
formations to occur in Tanbo.  In particular, separate roots of the 
same color will never be joined.  Roots will not form closed loops or 
clumps.  Every root will contain one of the stones of the initial 
configuration (shown in FIGURE A).  New roots will never be created 
during the course of the game.

All of the formations in FIGURE F are impossible.  They cannot be 
created without violating the rules of Tanbo.


THE EXPANDED ROOT
=================
When a player makes a move, he connects his newly added stone to only 
one of his roots.  This root increases in size by one and is referred 
to as the "expanded root" during the player's turn.

The "expanded root" concept is essential to an understanding of the 
following sections.


ROOT SPACE
==========
The "root space" of a root consists of the available legal moves 
which serve to expand that root.  A root is "free" if it has at least 
one point of root space.  For example, in FIGURE E, point L4 is the 
only point of root space for the small black root.  Because that root 
has root space, it is free.


BOUNDED ROOTS
=============
A root becomes "bounded" when a move is made which completely deprives 
that root of root space.  For example, in FIGURE E, if white adds a 
stone to point L4, white deprives the small black root of root space, 
therefore bounding it.

Alternatively, white could bound one of his own roots by moving to 
point S3 in FIGURE E.  Expanding this small white root would leave it 
with no root space, therefore bounding it.

The "bounded root" concept is central to Tanbo.


REMOVING BOUNDED ROOTS
======================
When a player makes a move which causes one or more roots to become 
bounded, he will be required to remove at least one of these bounded 
roots from the board, during his current turn. This is described in 
detail in the following sections.


  FIGURE G:                    FIGURE H:

EXPANDED AND BOUNDED ROOT IS REMOVED FROM THE BOARD
===================================================
If you make a move which expands and bounds one of your roots, you 
must immediately remove this expanded and bounded root from the board. 
FIGURES G and H demonstrate such a move on a 9 by 9 board.  By moving 
to point J1 in FIGURE G, white expands and bounds the small white root 
in the lower right corner.  White must immediately remove the expanded 
and bounded root, as shown in FIGURE H.

REMOVE ONLY THE EXPANDED, BOUNDED ROOT - NO OTHER ROOTS
=======================================================
If your move expands and bounds one of your roots, and simultaneously 
bounds one or more additional roots of either color, you must 
immediately remove the expanded root, and only the expanded root.  
You must not remove any additional roots during your current turn.  
The additional roots, which are momentarily bounded during your turn, 
become free again when you remove the expanded root.

FIGURES I and J demonstrate such a move.  By moving to point D5 in 
FIGURE I, white expands the white root in the upper left corner.  This 
move simultaneously bounds three roots: the expanded root, the black 
root in the lower left corner, and the white root in the lower right 
corner.  White must immediately remove the expanded root, and only the 
expanded root, as shown in FIGURE J.

Two roots in FIGURE J, which were momentarily bounded during white's 
turn, became free again when white removed the expanded, bounded root.  
The white root in the lower right corner reclaimed its one point of 
root space.  The black root in the lower left corner gained a few 
points of root space.

At the conclusion of a turn, there should not be any bounded roots on 
the board.

IF ONE OR MORE ROOTS GET BOUNDED, AND THE EXPANDED ROOT IS
==========================================================
NOT ONE OF THE BOUNDED ROOTS, REMOVE ALL THE BOUNDED ROOTS.
===========================================================
If you move to bound one or more roots of either or both colors, and 
the expanded root is not one of the bounded roots, you must 
immediately remove all of the roots which you bounded by making that 
move.

By moving to point D5 in FIGURE K, white expands the root in the upper 
left corner, and the expanded root is not bounded.  However, two other 
roots are bounded by this move: the black root in the lower left 
corner, and the white root in the lower right corner.  White must 
immediately remove the two bounded roots, as shown in FIGURE L.


SUMMARY - WHEN TO REMOVE ROOTS
==============================
In summary, whenever a move causes a single root to be bounded, that 
root is immediately removed.  When a player's move causes two or more 
roots to be simultaneously bounded, the player must look at the 
expanded root.  

If the expanded root is one of the bounded roots, then the expanded 
root, and only the expanded root is removed.
  
Otherwise, if the expanded root is not one of the bounded roots, then 
all of the bounded roots must be removed.  

The rules for removing roots were designed to ensure that when all 
eight of a player's roots have been eliminated, the other player will 
still have at least one root remaining on the board.  This prevents 
ties from occuring.


RETURN OPPOSING ROOTS TO OPPONENT
=================================
Whenever you remove an opposing root from the board, you must return 
its stones to your opponent.  Players never take ownership of opposing 
stones.  After stones have been returned to their owner, they can be 
played again during later turns.


OBJECT OF THE GAME
==================
To win, a player must eliminate all eight of his opponent's roots.  
One player will always win.  It's impossible to repeat a board 
configuration in Tanbo.  Therefore a game cannot result in a draw.

FIGURES M and N show the last turn of a game.  In FIGURE M, each 
player has one root remaining on the board.  Black's only available 
move is point J9, and point J9 is also the black root's only remaining 
point of root space. By moving to point J9, black bounds his last 
remaining root which he immediately removes from the board, as shown 
in FIGURE N. White has won the game.

BEGINNERS CAN USE A 9 BY 9 BOARD
================================
Beginners can play Tanbo on a 9 by 9 board with the initial setup 
shown in FIGURE O.  After a few games, players will easily distinguish 
one root from another.  And they will keep track of how much root 
space each root has available.  Players should advance to the 
tournament size, 19 by 19 board at this point.

    ORIGINS

***********************

Tanbo was, of course, inspired by Go.  I  concentrated nearly 
continuously for about three weeks, searching inner space for a new 
game-playing mechanism.  The result was Tanbo.

I played Tanbo for a year and a half before releasing this document,
and I plan to keep playing for years to come.
  
Tanbo is a subtle game.  There's not a lot of capturing.  As with Go, 
you must safety your groups and you must fight a series of territorial 
battles. 

My thanks to Hernan Contreras.  He discovered a bug in the initial set 
of rules, and he plays Tanbo with me often.
