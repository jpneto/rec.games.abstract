you know, I ran into some VERY screwed up rules playing with some of my friends.
for instance, if the last three cards played were all primes (J, K count) the
player of the third had to say "Pi primes" and the number of the last card was the
number of places to the left that play shifted.

or, from the quasi-mao variant, ALL non-court cards must be called"
spades as 'rank+8 "clipboards"', all other suits as 'rank+8 "next higher suit in
bridge order"'.  Naaasty.

Of course, this was the same variant that required players to say "Please"
before drawing a card and "Thank you" after placing it in their hand.
