  My question for the comp.programming folks: I quickly determined
that the standard alpha-beta pruning technique doesn't help with
this game, because I don't know any way to evaluate the "strength"
of a position except as a win or loss. So most of the branches in
an alpha-beta tree of any reasonable depth (i.e., not deep enough
to see all possible endings) end up with a value of zero, which means
the computer is moving randomly most of the time.

Perhaps you could borrow the concept of stress (or do I mean strain?)
from engineering.  The stress on any given blocks is the number of
blocks that would move (including itself) if it were knocked out.   You
could then try minimaxing on something like one of:
     minimise the total stress
     maximise the number of "low" stress blocks
     minimise the number of "high" stress blocks
subject to the constraint that there must be an even number of
unsaturated (stress &lt; number of remaining blocks) after each move.

Just a thought -- I've no idea whether it'd work....
