I have played a game a number of times with friends (one of whom
is exceptional at second-guessing me). To play the game, you lay
out 7 cells in a row (I normally just draw around a large coin
7 times - the Australian 20c piece is excellent), and you need
a token (I use the same coin). I usually draw it like so:

                      |
   .-.   .-.   .-.   .-.   .-.   .-.   .-.
  |   | |   | |   | |   | |   | |   | |   |
   `-'   `-'   `-'   `-'   `-'   `-'   `-' 
                      | 

The aim is for the two players (Left and Right, say) to move the token 
to their end of the row. Each turn, the players choose a number of
points to expend, and the player spending the highest number of points
moves the token one cell. The players begin with the token in the centre,
and a stock of 50 points (though it is interesting to try different numbers).

The choice of points is made simultaneously (write them down in secret).

If you move the token to your end (goal), you win.

You must always spend at least one point.
You can only spend an integral number of points.
You can't spend more points than you have.

If you have no points left at the start of a turn (i.e. with the token 
still in play), you lose. If both players run out of points with the
token still in play, its a tie (even if one player has a positional
advantage).

--------------------- 

Now what I want to know, is "What's the name of this game?"
I'm certain I read about it somewhere (I don't think up games this
good myself, normally). Where did I read about this game, if anywhere?

If you think of the points as "energy" the game is a lot like a tug of war,
and that's what I often call it, but usually I end up calling it "you
know, that game we play with the coin", which is less than satifactory,
especially since the coin serves no essential purpose.

I'm in the process of writing a program to play a cut-down version of
the game (5 cells and fewer points). I wrote a version of the full
game once before, but I was able to beat it easily. Now with the
cut down version, I can explicitly work out the game-theoretic "optimal"
strategy, but I also want to have the program try sometimes to exploit patterns
in the opponent's moves (people do tend to be fairly patterned in their
moves), but not in a predictable fashion itself (i.e. it will only deviate
from the optimal strategy in a non-obvious way - and will fall back on
the unbeatable strategy if it comes off badly). But before I really get
stuck into it fully, I want to call it something.

thanks,

Glen

(Oh, the sweetness of guessing one point higher than your opponent!
 The bitter Pyrrhic victory of spending 12 points to your opponent's 1!)
