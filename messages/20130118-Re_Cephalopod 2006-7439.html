You did not answer my question :

Exasott and Hold That Line???

What are you so hysterical about?  You've been screaming about this shit for weeks.  I suppose I should be flattered that my opinion is so important to you. Ok, Hazen.  I'll answer your question as honestly and directly as I can.

In my opinion, Exasott and Hold That Line really are fairly similar games.  

They both have a grid of dots, which dots are removed throughout play.  In HTL, dots are removed by the rule that a dot can't be visited twice.  In Exasott dots are simply removed when a stick connects them.  Btw, I don't like the arbitrariness of having a fixed number of sticks of pre-set sizes.

Both games involve connecting the dots with lines of various lengths and at various angles.  HTL has the restriction that one end of a new segment must continue the path of segments on the board.  Exasott has the restriction that the two connected dots must be within one row or column of each other.  So there's a difference.

Both games have the classic, combinatorial ending.  In Exasott the winner is the last player with an available move.  In HTL it's the misere version.  You don't want to be the last.  Same exact idea though.

I'm not a big fan of combinatorials.  I went through a combinatorial phase and designed a few of them myself, but ending a game with "the last player to have a move" is aesthetically poor and there's very little design challenge with that type of ending.

I'm overall not tremendously impressed with either Exasott or HTL.  That's my honest opinion.  If it's fucking you up, I'm sorry.  I'm not going to lie for you to spare your feelings though.

1. Drop 
2. Capture 
3. Once the board is full count.
 
I will post a new game based on the same pattern.

With new capture mechanism NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

You'll earn my praise and respect as a designer when you do that.  Just make sure it's naturally finite (i.e. no superko) as Cephalopod is.  

I'll believe your new game when I see it, Hazen.  You have zero credibility with me because of the endless "GOODBYES!!!", the innumerable nicknames, the claims of gambling earnings, the promise of a new game site, etc., etc., etc.  Good luck though :)
