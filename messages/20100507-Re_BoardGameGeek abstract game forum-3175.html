By the way, what happened to this newsgroup?  I know it used to be
more busy.

Good question, Rich, and you're right.  This newsgroup was busier
before.  But it was busy being Bill Taylor's Social Club for Bald
Aging Men.  Long story short, Bill Taylor created Projex, the world's
most unplayable game, *16 years ago*.  Everyone got real excited, had
a big discussion about Projex, and then... nothing.

Along comes Mark Steere pounding out abstract games by the dozen.
Shit, what do we do with this guy?  He certainly hasn't "earned" our
respect.

Rich, that statement was so intelligent, I had to scroll up and make
sure it was really you.  Yes!  Rec.games.abstract is now "mostly a
place for one person to dump their thoughts and game designs."
