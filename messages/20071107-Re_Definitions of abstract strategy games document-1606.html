Your Friend here:

An association is there to serve the needs of its members.  If the
membership have joined up to "work with games that have the longest
lasting appeal, but have the most problems in the marketplace" then
that's the sort of games they'll be interested in.

Peter, this seems like very good sense to me.   Definitions generally seem 
to be about drawing significant distinctions between things in the world, 
focusing on particular aspects or attributes of things ... but generally we 
have a much better sense of what is fundamentally in or outside a certain 
category than we can easily express.  In the case of IAGO I think we're 
talking about an association to promote a certain kind of activity (playing 
abstract strategy games) and a simple list of typical instances will suffice 
to indicate to most people who comes across IAGO what we are talking about: 
games of which the most familiar would be Chess, Go, Xangqi, 
Checkers/Draughts, Reversi/Othello and most recently the GIPF series of 
games.  A short list of games that would not be included would help too: 
Monopoly, Clue, Risk, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit.     Once that is said most 
people who have played games would know what is being talked about. 
Attempts at definitions are fine and thanks to Rick for his work on this 
(and IAGO in general) - but it really shouldn't be something that a possible 
new member of IAGO sees as a headline issue in the organisation - those 
should be the practical issues.   (And I say all this as a someone who spent 
5 university years on philosophy and related subjects and used to happily 
debate the notion of "freedom" through the night - more practical struggles 
on key less disputed elements of "freedom" seem more important now).

The thing I would most like to see is the existence of IAGO clubs (or IAGO 
affiliated clubs or IAGO evenings) where it would be possible to attend and 
play more than one type of abstract game.   A Chess or Bridge club might be 
persuaded to hold such an evening run by a IAGO member.    As regards 
Backgammon and Bridge etc I would see that as primarily a pragmatic issue. 
If people who gather together to play abstract games sometimes play 
Backgammon or Bridge then that is fine (though fans of Bridge who also like 
other abstract games would be more likely to want to play Bridge at a Bridge 
club!)  ... it would be somewhat surprising if several people who gathered 
together at an evening of abstract games decided they wished to play 
monopoly (on that evening).    In areas where there is no Go club I could 
imagine that Go playing/teaching might be the main activity of such a club 
but it would be somewhere where someone interested in other abstract games 
might expect a warm welcome ... and that would be some achievement.

As regards International Tournaments sponsored by IAGO then that would be 
down to the membership votes - and it would be surprising if they would 
chose to sponsor events that focused primarily on games that already had an 
existing organisational and tournament structure.

(apologies for the rambling tone of this - off work with a virus at the 
moment!)

Regards

Mike

PS Defining what an abstract game is for IAGO shouldn't be akin to creating 
the rules of an abstract game - clear &amp; unambiguous.   It is a practical 
matter - what are those attracted to IAGO happy to recognise as abstact 
games or borderline abstract games.
