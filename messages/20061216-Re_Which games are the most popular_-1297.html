<br>
<br>The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>idea<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of playing a game always sounds great.&nbsp; I imagine stepping
<br>outside real life for a while and doing something playful and
<br>artificial--just having fun, sort of immersing myself in an alternate
<br>reality.
<br>
<br>But when it gets right down to actually playing a game, I'm at least
<br>somewhat disappointed every time.&nbsp; I think, "This isn't what I imagined
<br>it'd be.&nbsp; For one thing there's work involved; it's not all play.
<br>Worse yet, there's competition--and I really don't want to beat
<br>anybody, and I sure don't want to get beaten.&nbsp; I hadn't really
<br>bargained for all this."
<br>
<br>Then, sometimes, there's another turnaround once I'm further into the
<br>game.&nbsp; When I'm warmed up to it, I start thinking, "Well, this is
<br>pretty interesting--and it's kinda fun too in its way.&nbsp; Not quite what
<br>I had pictured, but I guess I do like it."
<br>
<br>Thanks to these mixed feelings, I've loved games all my life, and yet I
<br>very rarely sit down and play a game with another person (though I play
<br>games on the computer all the time).
<br>
<br>The gambler's or sports fan's enthusiasm for gaming is completely alien
<br>to me.&nbsp; I see such people getting excited over game playing, and it
<br>obviously means a great deal to them, but it's far removed from my
<br>consciousness and lifestyle.&nbsp; I just don't get it.

<br>Have you tried roleplaying games?
