Hello,
	To those of you familiar with the game Quatro and its brother Set
(both "approved" by mensa), do you know where the origins of these games are?

	To those of you not famililar here is a brief description of the 
games:

	In Set there is a deck of card each with objects of a certain shape,
number, and color.   The object is to get three cards that have all the same
property, or all different for each of the properties defined (eg. a set
could be a card with one blue rectangles, two red circles, and three yellow
ovals. )  One person deals the cards and keeps a certain number of cards out
on the table, and those playing compete to get the most Sets before the deck
is dealt.  After all have delt, the total number of Sets is counted for each
person and the winner is he with the most Sets.

	In Quatro there are 16 peices of the following form:

	Size  color shape  Hole?
	----- ----- -----  ----- 
	Short black square yes
	Short black square no
	Short black circle yes         The board looks like this
	Short black circle no
	Short white square yes			
	Short white square no		O    O    O    O
	Short white circle yes
	Short white circle no	        O    O    O    O
	Tall  black square yes
	Tall  black square no	        O    O    O    O
	Tall  black circle yes
	Tall  black circle no	        O    O    O    O
	Tall  white square yes
	Tall  white square no
	Tall  white circle yes
	Tall  white circle no

	The play starts by one player selecting a piece for his opponent,
the opponent then sets the piece on the board and selects a piece for the
first player.  The play continues in a like manner till one person creates
a row of four with one property being similiar throughout.

	Any extra tidbits one might know about these games would be
appreciated.

			Cheers,	Matthew
