I think another game that was designed with resistance to
programmability in mind was Don Green's Octi, and I think you'd have
to say it also uses the exploding branch density approach.  I'm not
sure how many programmers have taken up the Octi gauntlet, and it is
certainly a less elegant game than Havannah.

The real mystery is how humans recognize patterns. Different games
pose different challenges for both bots and humans. A game that is in
extreme opposition to Hex or Havannah is Martin Medema's Explocus:

It is simple and elegant, and even in the 80's, the stone age, humans
wouldn't stand a chance against a program written by Wim van Weezep
that used an extremely simple evaluation function.
Nowadays, with the old type evaluation being successfully replaced by
MC output in certain games, bots do not in any way mimic human
evaluation, and depending on the type of game, either side may still
prevail. There are a lot of intruiging "why's" here.
