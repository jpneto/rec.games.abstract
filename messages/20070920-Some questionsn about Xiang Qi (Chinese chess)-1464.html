response.)

To Whom It May Concern:



I have only recently discovered Xiang Qi.  I would like to learn as much
about it as I can, but I am handicapped by the lack of printed matter in
English.  Also, I there seem to be not nearly as many Xiang Qi web sites as
there are Western chess web sites, so the Internet has not yielded much
fruit.  Perhaps I am looking in the wrong places?  And I noticed that
rec.games.chinese-chess is the only usenet group dedicated to Xiang Qi, and
it does not appear to be very active.  Are there others that I can be
directed to?  In addition, there doesn't seem to be in the United States
(from where I am writing) a Xiang Qi counterpart to the U.S. Chess
Federation, so there seems to be no "clearinghouse" or central location from
which one can request information.



Some questions:

1)      As far as I can tell, the Xiang Qi Review is defunct, as is its
publisher, the Chinese Chess Institute.  Is this information correct?  If
so, where can I get back issues of the Review?  If the information is
incorrect, can someone please direct me to the Review and Institute's
present location?  Is David Woo, the editor, still alive?  How may he be
contacted?

2)      Can anyone provide me with a list of texts regarding Xiang Qi that
are available in English?

3)      Can anyone provide me with addresses of any Xiang Qi clubs around
the world?

4)      Where should I go to learn of the history and culture of the game?
I imagine that there must be in Xiang Qi's history colorful characters,
famous games/tournaments, renowned strategic successes and failures, etc.,
as there are in Western chess.

5)      What are the best computer programs for Xiang Qi?

6)      What are the best web sites (in English) for Xiang Qi?

7)      Is Daniel H. Li, author of The Genealogy of Chess still alive?  How
may he be contacted.







Thanks very much for your time and attention!
