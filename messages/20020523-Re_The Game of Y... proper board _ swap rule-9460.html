|Can I assume the boards shown in the above two links are the official
|"Y" board, and the hexagon board used when playing with the Zillions
|engine is simply one of many alternate boards to play on?

I have corresponded with Ea Ea, who developed the game with Charles
Titus. The board shape as shown in the above links is the result of
several years of evolution and playtesting, and should be regarded
as the official version. It is true that it would be difficult to
implement this board in Zillions, inasmuch as the 'grid' command
would not be usable, but it would still be possible.

Here is what Ea told me:

... There are two Y boards that were used as tournament boards.
One was just about the same as the Kadon board but the 5-sided regions
were slightly closer to the center of the board. That was the "Junior
Tournament" board. The regular "Tournament" board is a larger board.
These boards can be found in the "Mudcrack Y and Poly-Y" book. The reason
that the Kadon set uses a different board is that the co-inventor
Charles Titus contacted Kadon and they didn't know how to get in touch with me.
Chuck was involved in the earlier stages of the development of  Y and used an
earlier form of the board. In fact Chuck was the inventor of  Y (which was also
invented independently by Claude Shannon, the inventor of Information Theory).
The original form had no 5-sided regions in the center of the board and was an
inferior game. I was responsible for the "Mudcrack Principle" which led to the
superior board with 5-sided regions in the center. Hex can be similarly improved
by putting a 4-sided region in the center of the board. Such a board is shown in
the "Mudcrack Y and Poly-Y" book, where I called the game with a generalized board
"Join". Since the Kadon "Game of  Y" board is readily available and since it is the
form that people are most likely to encounter now it would be better to use that
board rather than the "Junior Tournament" board. It might possibly be desirable
to have the larger "Tournament" board, but that seems unfair to Kadon who has a
significant investment in the Game of  Y. I would go with the wishes of  Kate Jones
of Kadon on that.

|2) When playing "Y" against the Zillions engine, the swap rule, as I
|understand it, is not being implemented correctly.
| ...
|Is this more than likely simply a mis-implementation of the swap rule
|by the author (L. Lynn Smith) who implemented the game for Zillions or
|is this unusual swap rule the official way to play "Y" ?

The correct opening protocol for Y is just 1-move equalization, also called
the "pie rule." It is described in the first link you give. It is the same as
the protocol used on Richard's server.
