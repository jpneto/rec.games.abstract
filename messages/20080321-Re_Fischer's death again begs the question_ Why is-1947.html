<br>The GM Slugfest is the most famous that I'm aware of. It used
<br>BAP scoring. (Black win =3, White win =2, Black draw =1)
<br>
<br>BTW, how does dreaming up ludicrous cheating scenarios help
<br>create a statistically significant number of games? You sound
<br>like someone who is desperate for these experiments not to
<br>go forth, lest they prove you wrong. Seriously, why is that?
<br>Why are you so attached to the status quo that you are
<br>willing to make irrational and false arguments to preserve it?
<br>
<br>I'm the first to admit that whatever experiments are tried are
<br>bound to have glitches and might not bring the intended
<br>consequences. But I like chess, want it to thrive, and understand
<br>that sports and games have to evolve to remain healthy.
<br>I would rather see chess played under the 1867 rules (draw=1/2)
<br>give way to chess played under a mathematically
<br>sounder alternate scoring system, than to see it die
<br>altogether.
