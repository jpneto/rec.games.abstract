<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting Patrick's message of Friday:

<br><blockquote type=cite>Well, James Bond played backgammon in one of the movies, I think.
<br>Probably one that came out in the 1970s, when backgammon enjoyed a
<br>resurgence of popularity.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I'm just out of date.&nbsp; Backgammon reminds me of a time in the 1770s, 
when gentlemen of discernment and taste played backgammon and whist. 
Not that I'm talking about personal memories here, of course.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>And besides what you've mentioned, chess is one of the best-looking 
games in the world.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I'd put it behind hnefatafl in that respect.&nbsp; While chess usually has 
the more finely sculptured pieces, one thing that attracted me to 
hnefatafl was the pleasing radial symmetry of the pieces, as initially 
set out for play on one of the bigger boards.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Some people will buy an expensive chess set just to decorate a room, 
even if they don't play.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I must admit, I've done that with a lot of board games.&nbsp; I've had to 
start putting them away again as the plants and "real" ornaments take 
over.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>When a game doesn't seem to be a metaphor or stylistic representation
<br>of anything, it starts to seem like just a mathematical exercise to me.
<br>That's when it starts to seem dry and boring--all work and no play.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Hence my attitude to "contrived" mechanisms in another posting.
