Mornington Crescent Illustrated with Expert Play

Mornington Crescent Simplified and Explained for Novices

Gregory Topov is a world famous Grandmaster in the classic game of
Mornington Crescent. He is also a long-standing honorary member of the
International Mornington Crescent Appreciation Society (class of 1972,
inducted as a post-modular professional, only the third player ever to be
inducted by priority universal acclamation). We are grateful for his
excellent contribution and willingness to explain some elementary aspects of
Mornington Crescent for the benefit of novice and intermediate players.

Description

Mornington Crescent is a strategy game for two or more players, although it
can also be played in teams or partnerships. It is a parlour game that can
be simple to grasp, yet its immense variations can not be exhausted by an
expert player even in a life-time of study. Mornington Crescent is limited
only by one's creativity and imagination, and it is herein that the game has
such appeal. It has well been said that Mornington Crescent has the
potential to be simpler than tic-tac-toe, yet more complex than chess.
Mornington Crescent enthusiasts are united in their conviction that this
game is unmatched by any other classic strategy game, and affords a
life-time of enjoyment for any serious player.

Objective

Most people are familiar with the main rules of Mornington Crescent, so I
will not risk redundancy by repeating them in full. They are also readily
available for study in the International Mornington Crescent Appreciation
Society Handbook (21st edition, published by Broxter &amp; Broxter, London,
1969). But perhaps it is useful to enumerate the basic objective, which is
elementary in its conception:
1. Be the first person to get to Mornington Crescent.
2. Prevent your opponents from getting there first.
Within these broad parameters, however, a complexity of strategies and
possibilities is permitted. To reduce the inevitable perplexity that
confronts the novice player, it is usual to adopt the house rules of a
popular local variation, such as the International Grand Prix Version of
Mornington Crescent, or the Traditional Board-Game Modern American Rules
Variation. Over 232 such variations have been documented by the
International Mornington Crescent Appreciation Society, with the 32 more
popular variations enumerated in the appendix of the afore-mentioned
Handbook.

Method of Play

It is unnecessary for me to explain how players conduct their "move" by
stating place-names, since this is relatively common knowledge. The usual
practice is that players in turn call out the name of a location, until one
player plays a weak move which gives an opponent the opportunity to
capitalize by playing Mornington Crescent and win the game. Novice players
who are not familiar with the playing field may wish to make use of a
detailed map, although this practice is typically frowned upon for games
conducted at official Mornington Crescent Clubs. Games have been concluded
in less than five minutes, but there are documented instances of games
stretching beyond an entire day. A typical game is usually completed within
an hour.

Rules

The precise rules are far too numerous to list here. Although the rules are
economical in their simplicity, the newcomer should not be surprised to find
them apparently complex and obscure. For this reason it is universally
agreed that the best way to learn the rules is to observe at length a game
played by experienced players, since the application of the rules can best
be learned by experience and observation. According to one ancient
tradition, it is not permitted to explain rules for play to the uninitiated,
particularly to those who have not yet attained grandmaster status. Much of
the success and enjoyment of Mornington Crescent is a product of its rules
being a well-guarded secret, except among genuine Mornington Crescent
enthusiasts. Novices should not be alarmed to discover that experienced
players typically engage in lengthy and lively debates about the rules and
their variations in the course of a game.

Openings

It is widely agreed that the opening of the game is decisive in determining
the direction of the game. One rule that is almost universally accepted by
all modern players is the "Second Prohibition Rule", which prohibits players
from declaring a proxy within the first three moves, or from moving two
spaces within the hex. Most modern versions of Mornington Crescent also
prohibit the positional extension gambits that were commonly played in
Europe in the nineteenth century, athough sometimes exceptions are made for
novice players. Some serious players have devoted their lives studying
opening theory, but novice players should be able to grasp the essentials of
common openings in short order by observing other players.

Learning the Game

Although some experts have advocated the use of the game of Acacia Avenue to
introduce novices to Mornington Crescent, I do not share this view. Acacia
Avenue (commonly referred to as "Kiddie Krescent" or "KK" by serious
players) is a simplified version of Mornington Crescent that was designed
for very young children. Its absurd simplicity does not recommend itself for
novice players, since the simplifications ruin the beauty of the traditional
game, and can hinder the development of sound strategy. Newcomers to the
game are best advised to try learning the rules of the traditional
Mornington Crescent by watching a regular advanced game being played by
experienced players, or by asking a Mornington Crescent player. In keeping
with the traditions of Mornington Crescent, novices will usually find that
most serious players will be reluctant to give extensive answers, and will
instead encourage a close following of the game in progress.

Strategy

Although advanced strategy is usually beyond most novice players, Graeme
Garden has done beginning Mornington Crescent players a wonderful service by
enumerating some helpful principles that serve as an excellent introductory
strategy for players not yet at the intermediate level:
* Boxing out the F, J, O and W placings draws the partner into an elliptical
progression north to south
* In weak positional play, it is vital to consolidate an already strong
outer square, eg Pentonville Road
* In a straight rules game, it's inadmissible to transfer inversely, which
is otherwise a powerful tactic
* Opening the triangle will block any of the three possible reverse draws
and is usually played early in the game (before the Central Line has been
quartered) so that the risk of a diagonal move is negligible, as is the
possibility of quartering
* The lateral shift decisively breaks opponents' horizontal and vertical
approaches.
* The A40 northbound used as a counter-play offers rear access to suburban
bidding
* It is widely agreed that the fourth of these principles is essential to
master for a good grip of the game.

History

The name Mornington Crescent is commonly believed to originate from the name
of a station on the London Underground system. However, recent research
published by Sir Henry Frienitscher has conclusively demonstrated that the
underground railway station in fact owes its name to the game, and not vice
versa. The origins of Mornington Crescent (The Game) remain a controversial
subject of debate. A predecessor of the game appears to have been played by
Vikings in Norway and Denmark, and there is also evidence that a Empire
Version was popular in the days of the Roman Emperor Nero. It flourished
particularly in Medieval Britain, which might well explain why even today
the British dominate the sport.

Players

Mornington Crescent continues to enjoy wide popularity throughout the world.
Over 1300 clubs have been registered with the International Mornington
Crescent Appreciation Society, and beyond this it is commonly played
informally in many local settings. Over a dozen international periodicals
are devoted exclusively to the analysis of Mornington Crescent games. An
annual convention is held in Stockholm, Sweden, and every four years the
International Mornington Crescent Olympiad is hosted in Germany. British
players have long since dominated the sport, including the current world
champion, Vincent Botham.

Literature

Samuel J. McAllister's "An Elementary Mornington Crescent Primer" (sixth
edition, 1975), is generally regarded as the best introductory guide for
beginners, although unfortunately it can be very difficult to obtain.
Although most authorities recommend the fifth edition of Bradley Taylor's
"Advanced Mornington Crescent: Improving Your Tactical Surprise and
Positional Advantage" (1982) for intermediate players, this book has been
out of print for some time. In my opinion, it has been surpassed by
grandmaster Maxwell Beverege's excellent two volume set, "Comprehensive
Mornington Crescent: A Champion Tells All" (Birmingham Press, 1989). This
excellent work is available only from exclusive and specialist game
bookstores. Serious players may wish to subscribe to Mornington Crescent
Journal. Subscription is only available by invitation from the Society
headquarters in Birmingham, and following the successful completion of
Master level exam. Some resources are available on the internet, but these
typically don't do justice to the nuances of the game, and tend to be
incomplete and erroneous on the finer points of the game.
