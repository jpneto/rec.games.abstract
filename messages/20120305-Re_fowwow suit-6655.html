Mark, I'm glad to see you finally admitting that the Sygo
balancing mechanism is a valid concept, but I'm afraid
the fact that you've only done so when you've incidentally
used a similar idea in one of your games is not precisely
to your credit.

This would have been easily avoided with a bit of integrity
on your part, if I may say so.

(Yes, I know a typical Mark Steere rant is coming. Go
ahead, it serves me right.) ;)

Nobody in this field has more integrity than me, Luis.  Initially I gave
Sygo the benefit of the doubt, that it worked on some level, but never that
it was "perfect" in any way, as Christian so often claimed.  Every time I
challenged Christian on the notion of a perfect balancing mechanism, he
either went on the offensive, accusing me of hounding him, or gave a tearful
departure speech, or whatever.  Months of handwaving, tapdancing and
backpedaling passed, but never an explanation.  Yes, eventually I began to
doubt Sygo entirely.  If Sygo were "perfect", or even valid, why the
grotesque fear of explaining it?  And yes, now seeing a Go expert come up
with a similar idea lends credence to Sygo, but not so much credence that
Sygo is now the holy grail Christian endlessly portrays it as.  At least not
for me.

I started at neutral on Sygo and went south due to the relentless onslaught
of ridiculous Sygo claims and evasiveness.  If the claim had been simply
that the Sygo mechanism reasonably balances the game at a reasonable board
size, I wouldn't have taken any notice.  But that wasn't good enough.  Sygo
had to be the holy grail.  Sygo had to be the basis of a massive, laurel
resting, bet-all-your-chips-on-Sygo campaign.

My primary complaint about Sygo was that it was fucking annoying, but now I
don't care any more.  Christian defeated me.  He wore me down with 15 months
of nonsense.
