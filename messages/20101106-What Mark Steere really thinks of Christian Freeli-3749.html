We're already knee deep in champagne corks popped by Christian Freeling in his own honor.  And the stories - FUCK I hate the stories.  A Christian Freeling &gt;classic: "I had just shat a lovely green turd when a fireworks factory explosion leveled my whole neighborhood, leaving only me on my toilet, exposed and &gt;stranded, and a pile of ash where the toilet paper once was.  Yet I soldiered on in the face of certain dingleberries..."

Beneath the uncanny veneer of praise and respect that Mark has put on
for Christian Freeling's arrival, is an all too obvious ploy to bait
and patronize Christian in an unmoderated setting, as he has been
doing on the Arimaa forum for some time in a moderated one. He
realizes Omar Syed's patience wears thin. Why has Mark brought
Christian Freeling on to the site just to berate him from behind the
cover of his shit-eating grin? How can you ask such a stupid question?
We're talking about Mark Steere of all people! Mark Steere gets off on
lording his ego over others and to lord his ego over the great
Christian Freeling is... well let me just say "someone get a bucket!".
One more chapter in the Mark Steere file. For volume one, look up Mark
Steere, The World's Only Prima Donna Abstract Games Designer.
