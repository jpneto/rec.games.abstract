Eeek!  By adding a no-repeat rule?  Say you get to a
king-vs-king-and-bishop position, which is currently a draw, since
there's no way for either side to give mate.  Then if you institute
the no-repeat rule, you keep moving these three pieces around until
one player cannot move without ending up in a previously-seen
position, of which there are only about 112,000

Here's a slightly more plausible way to eliminate chess draws (at least,
ones due to insufficient material), while maintaining both playability
and the current spirit of the game.  Change the rule from

  (NOW) If neither player makes a pawn move or a capture in 50
        consecutive moves, the game is a draw.

  (NEW) If either player fails to make a pawn move or a capture in 50
        consecutive moves, that player immediately loses.

One consequence would be that in a position with true insufficient
material, such as king vs. king and bishop, the last player to make a
capture would win.

In general, there would be an added state in endgame positions which are
becoming drawish: the last player to capture/pawn-move would have the
advantage, and the other player would be forced to make progress to
avoid losing.
