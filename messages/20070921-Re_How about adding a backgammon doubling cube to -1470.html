The idea:
1. Players play to an agreed number of points (obtained by playing a
series of a game), or a set number of games (the player with the most
points at the end wins the match).  Unless stakes are raised, players
get 1 point each if game ends in a tie.  Winner gets 2 points on a
win, zero with a loss.
2. Points per game start at 2.
3. If player asks opponent to resign, and opponent agrees, then their
opponent resigns.
4. If opponent doesn't resign, then for game are doubled.  The player
who raised the stakes must win the game, in order to get the full
amount of new points.  If their opponent wins they game, then the
opponent gets a full amount of points.  If game ends in a draw,
opponent gets half the amount of new points (this is done to encourage
players to play for win).
5. Redoubling is permitted.  A player is only allowed to double or
redouble once, until their opponent agrees to redouble.

I expect that it would get people to resign a little faster which might
help get through a series of games quicker.

Which would help out chess actually, and cause far less draws (one
thing to combat with chess is draws).  The idea I had was to have it
so that you had some form of stakes that went beyond the board layout
to add a level of intrigue to a usual deterministic boardgame.
However, as backgammon shows, it can be applied to a game involving
luck.  In a wargame format, you could possible push someone who thinks
their dice to roll to concede for example.  There are some games where
you feel it is helpless, and shouldn't be.

Someone said the computer chess program Fritz comes with a doubling
cube as an option.

This doubling cube option doesn't just have top be applied to a series
of the same game.  You can play a series of games Droo style and break
out the doubling cube.  By the way, to see Droo, go here:

It is a metagame meant to link a series of games together, due to
Stonehenge lending to having a bunch of games for it.
