Yes, there were several abstracts I didn't include, including one on a
Go board that I thought you might be interested in.

Can you give a link, I don't feel like wading through the whole bunch.

Anyone want to wager a guess about which games will win?  I fear "our"

Yes, but you can't generalize up to one person, so who knows.
Cartography might be a game women enjoy. But that's the same

I don't quite agree 'our' games don't stand a chance. The only known
games that are over a thousand years old, or their ancestors at least,
are Go, Chess, Mancalas, Morris ... and Draughts isn't too young
either.

Great that Luis entered Yodd!
