A reasonable thing not to know.  Remember, and not to gloat about it, but
you were initially convinced that Redstone was "random" and "tedious".  One
can only intuit so much.

It'll take a lot more courage to commit Go blasphemy.  No one is upset if
you like a game more than Hex.

38 years isn't "enough centuries".

lol, Your initial Oust suspicions carry about as much weight as your initial
Redstone suspicions, Graham.  Accurate suspicions have been amazingly scarce
over the years.  Play the game and then let's talk about your suspicions.

Assume the Oust board and the Go board to be the same size.  Or, more
accurately, assume the same number of turns, on average, to complete play. 
The Oust board would be smaller because of more effective stone recycling.

Evidence for either of these claims?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Because of an increase in significant capturing over Go, though not being a
total capture-fest like Rive, Oust gameplay is richer.  You don't have these
predictable move sequences in Oust that you have in Go, and therefore play
is not so easy to memorize.  Oust has been out for years.  It's so
non-productive to now go back and address uninformed suspicions.

No, I don't have evidence, per se, Graham, but neither do you.  Play Oust
one time and then trump me and outwit me.  And write a program that can beat
me.  I'll send you a fancy set of red Go stones.
