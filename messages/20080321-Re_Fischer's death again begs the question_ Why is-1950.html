<br>No, I'm not.&nbsp; I just can't see much difference in the way the

<br><blockquote type=cite>No. It tells us that if the scoring system makes the return on playing

<br>And have them all look pretty much alike, rather than better than 
weaker opponents... not actually too smart.

<br>Komi is a very recent innovation in the long history of competitve Go.

<br><blockquote type=cite>If alternate scoring eliminates the GM draw, and makes chess games,
<br>on average, more combative and more interesting, what is the downside?
<br></blockquote>
<br>None, but does it actually do that?&nbsp; Or does it just discourage 
combative play because the penalties for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>losing<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have just got 
bigger as much as it encourages attacking?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>It's popular to play. But note that at the amateur level,
<br>draws are far rarer.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Perhpas the players are further apart?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>The fundamental mystery of chess is why such a
<br>popular game has so little attention paid to its best
<br>players. The answer, I think, is that the best
<br>players are playing in competitions in which
<br>draw-producing play and strategies based
<br>on drawing rule. Chessplayers are human and
<br>humans respond to drama. If 75% of games
<br>are draws, and many of those draws are
<br>not even contested, you've got a situation that
<br>is designed to alienate the average chess
<br>enthusiast. Now I will grant that how much
<br>better things can be is an unknown - but we will
<br>never know until we try.
<br></blockquote>
<br>That's true, but I suspect it won't be as electric a change as you 
suspect because you're making losing worse as well as winning better.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>In fact the chess world has from time to time
<br>introduced various rules (e.g. the Sophia rules)
<br>to deal with the draw problem, but these have
<br>largely been ineffective. I think that all measures
<br>that ignore the underlying risk/reward calculations
<br>that chessplayers face are destined to fail.
<br></blockquote>
<br>But since losing gets as much worse as winning gets better, and 
combative play is often riskier, you haven't really changed 
anything in the net risk/reward equation.&nbsp; It still averages out.
