What a crazy challenge, making my little head explode. Well, one should
think that there is a lot of positions, solving that little puzzle. They are
just damn hard to find !!! But the fact that I maneged to come up with one,
in just a single hour suggest that there is a lot of them. But let me start
by saying: that it is very normal in a game (between good othello players)
to sacrifice a corner for even greater advantages. Let me also say, that the
position below is constructed, I don't know if it could appear in a real
game (maybe):

   a b c d e  f  g h
1 e o e o o o o o
2 o e o o o o o o
3 o o o o o o o o
4 o e e o o o o o
5 e e e x o o o x
6 e e e x x o x o
7 e e x x x x o x
8 x x x x x x x x

e = empty
x = black
o = white

It is black's turn to play, his only option is to play b2 (forced move).
With perfect play he will lose 19-43.
If we by divine intervention changes h8 into a white disc, black have to
pass his turn. He has no legal moves, that lucky bastard. (acces to b2 is
eliminated). With perfect play he wins 36-28.
