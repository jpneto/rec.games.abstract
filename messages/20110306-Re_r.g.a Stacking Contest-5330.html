Okay and I'll apologize. Mark, I was on a collision course with your
ego and this was just a bit of defensive driving on my part. I'm just
giving you a dose of reality here. "Rive is a great game if you don't
mind the wildcard element." These are the words of a man who is having
trouble coming to terms with a failure despite the ingenuity of his
idea. That wildcard element= low clarity, opacity. People don't find
games where they can't make tangible gains throughout interesting. You
can only take a blatant disregard for "fun" so far. I admit fun is a
bit of a bullshit word but you could have the same sort of experience
playing Conway's Life on your own as two people playing Rive do.
