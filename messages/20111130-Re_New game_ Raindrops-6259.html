Considering the renaming of Particle Bond's to "Slither" (a good
thing, showing that a name may be as important as a game :) it occured
to me that it would have been a perfect name for Raindrops too. That
station being passed, I must say that the game's "raindrops" do not
quite behave like raindrops. Starting from Slither I felt "Slide"
might be a good alternative for it. There's a guessing game/book
called "Slither &amp; Slide" but it's very unabstract (if that's a word).
