Markrappy I challenge to post your game Cephalopod to xkcd.com



Then you will know who I am.



I know that you have no balls to post it there.



Someone will analyze it and you will know what you worth.



Less than zero.

A liability.



My advise : Go back to shool Markrappy. It is not too late.



Try to speak and read at least 6 languages.



The one who speak only one language is ILLITERATE. Someone said that long time ago.

You are like Christian Freeling.
He opened a contest to programmers to implement Symple. 
He won 2 games and drew the conclusion that human are more performant than computers????????????????????????
How idiot is this guy!!!!
Give people one million dollars contest then you will see if you can beat the worst program of the contest.

You are talking to people who know nothing about abstract games.
All those guys are self-promoted experts.
Where there is no money no huge interest anyone can promote himself as an expert.
Lot of high level mathematician do not simply care about abstract games.
Only crappy mathematicians are involved in that field. 
Only crappy programmers are involved in that field.
