In Sygo a draw will be a rare event and never devoid of drama.

I agree that the rule 'fits like a glove', but it <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> an extra rule,
and it is 'wearing its intent on its sleeve' as Nick put it. The
intent is to eradicate the draw in a system that doesn't particularly
suffer from it. A draw in Sygo may well be a satisfactory outcome for
both. So I don't see draws as the bogeyman of game inventing.
Depending on the nature of the game, a small margin may even give it
more style, I feel.
That's an opinion not shared by everyone ;-)

And I respect it. :-)

Anyway, it's good to know that Sygo could be made drawless so
effortlessly if draws ever became a problem. I guess it must be
accounted as one of Sygo's good qualities, even if it's an incidental
one. Chess and draughts can't even dream of such possibility...

Of course, games where the victory is awarded on points, like this
one, are unlikely to suffer from high draw percentages. Rather, I was
thinking of the scheduling problems which would arise in elimination
tournaments, where a draw requires an extra game to be played. (Yes,
I'm assuming Sygo <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>will<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> be played in tournaments ;-) ) Take arimaa,
for example. At first, Omar was glad that his game had a small draw
rate, but when it came to tournaments, he willingly made a natural
change in the rules to eradicate draws.
