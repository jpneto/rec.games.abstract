So, the "Y" state is expanded into 19 different states internally (if I
have counted correctly), 10 of which are terminal, and 9 of which are
not yet "long enough" to end the game.  These states do not have any
loopiness, so they can be analyzed normally.

This seems like a very good way in theory, but in practice, the number
of states would expand tremendously.

Yep, you got that right.  Welcome to the world of artificial intelligence.

Aha! I seem to have found a much simpler way, if my logic is correct. 
Let me know if I have reasoned incorrectly.

...

In this way, I have addressed this complex-valued draw-by-repetition
problem with negligible additional effort and at the cost of only some
additional memory (for an intermediary copy of the unsettled values).

Are there any holes in my reasoning?  Can other cases of state
expansion in game trees be solved similarly?

I would say that you have successfully convinced yourself that you can
deal with loopy positions algorithmically, but that you are fooling
yourself that it's simpler.  As far as I can tell, the "intermediary
copies" that you are referring to are simply dynamically-generated
versions of the "expanded states" that I proposed above.

I think it is time to pick a simple game with a loopy endgame and try to
write out the analysis, either by hand or with computer assistance.

Winning Ways has several simple examples, and introduces the concept of
"sidling" as a generalization of "repeated positions cause the game to
end".

Here is a paper by another person who is working on other
loopy-to-non-loopy-conversion issues:

which is included as a chapter in <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Games of No Chance<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>

A lot of the problems and trade-offs of different state-search
strategies and state-representation issues are discussed in Russel and
Norvig, chapter 3, and are then applied in chapter 5 specifically to
the searching of 2-player game trees.

It sounds like you are having fun with this.  I wish I had time to get
into it all again.
