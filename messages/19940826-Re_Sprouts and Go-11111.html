2&gt;  Go with passing.  Awhile ago a go variant was discussed on
r.g.go  where a legal move was to pass and store up the move for
later use.  If you have 3 moves stored up then on your turn you can
make up to 4 moves in a row (all of which must be legal ... 2 eyes
is still enough).  How large must the board be before passing is the
correct first move?

Passing is always optimal, unless playing in the center is the best
first move.  The reason is that, whatever first move you would otherwise
make, you can just wait to see what your opponent does, and then make
the same first move, followed by your normal second move.  By symmetry,
you can't be denied the opportunity to make whatever your first move
would otherwise have been.

   True.  Even more is true, not only must the only correct first
move be in the center, but the center play must be the refutation to
all other first moves.  As strong as this condition may seem it holds
on small boards (certainly 3x3 and 5x5) ... 7x7 seems unclear but I
suspect passing is still bad.  The 9x9 case seems the least clear to me.
The center point is still the correct first move (I believe) but I'm
not sure that it is the correct refutation of the others.  Anyone have
any ideas?

  Another question along these lines (basically impossible to answer)
is how many times both sides should pass on larger boards like 19x19.

We are faced with the very real possibility that "digital" and 
"manual" will be used as antonyms.
