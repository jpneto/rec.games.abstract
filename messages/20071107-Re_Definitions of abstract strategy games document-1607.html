Peter, this seems like very good sense to me.   Definitions generally seem
to be about drawing significant distinctions between things in the world,
focusing on particular aspects or attributes of things ... but generally we
have a much better sense of what is fundamentally in or outside a certain
category than we can easily express.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is an issue I have run across myself and it seems to come up in
conversations.  It is like everyone seems to intuitively know what an
abstract strategy game is.  The problem is that, collectively, the
intuition varies, and causes conflicts and arguments.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In the case of IAGO I think we're
talking about an association to promote a certain kind of activity (playing
abstract strategy games) and a simple list of typical instances will suffice
to indicate to most people who comes across IAGO what we are talking about:
games of which the most familiar would be Chess, Go, Xangqi,
Checkers/Draughts, Reversi/Othello and most recently the GIPF series of
games.  A short list of games that would not be included would help too:
Monopoly, Clue, Risk, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit.     Once that is said most
people who have played games would know what is being talked about.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ok, that will also need to be worked on, and will be in the forefront
of the description.  It probably should go in the About IAGO section,
and state include and excluded (like above).  The academia documents
are still there to work on minutia discussion.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Attempts at definitions are fine and thanks to Rick for his work on this
(and IAGO in general) - but it really shouldn't be something that a possible
new member of IAGO sees as a headline issue in the organisation - those
should be the practical issues.   (And I say all this as a someone who spent
5 university years on philosophy and related subjects and used to happily
debate the notion of "freedom" through the night - more practical struggles
on key less disputed elements of "freedom" seem more important now).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is a case of the internal foundation stuff the work.  The issues
are mostly of concern to people trying to get games in under the IAGO
banner and also tournament play.  Well, I will say the third category
is whether or not what is played will caused Combinatorial Game Theory
purists to storm off in protest if Chess960 shows up as an IAGO game
(I mean Chess960 in its usual form now, not some Thompson version).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The thing I would most like to see is the existence of IAGO clubs (or IAGO
affiliated clubs or IAGO evenings) where it would be possible to attend and
play more than one type of abstract game.   A Chess or Bridge club might be
persuaded to hold such an evening run by a IAGO member.    As regards
Backgammon and Bridge etc I would see that as primarily a pragmatic issue.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

One of the functions of IAGO is to serve as a catch all where people
can find other people to play chess variants and more abscure
abstracts.  A local club would work like a traditional hobbist game
club that plays multiple wargames and euros, but be focused on
abstract strategy games.  What I do propose for flexibility is that
backgammon, bridge or whatever can show up at an IAGO club meeting as
part of a multigame Athlon tournament, where at least 50% of the games
are standard (pure) abstracts in that tournament (something like say a
Chess-Texas Hold'em Biathlon).  This way, you have a device to allow
people who don't normally play abstracts to get exposed to them.
Well, I will let what percentage on the Athlon pan themselves out
here, and other minutia.  The idea here is to act as an ambassador
with this.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
If people who gather together to play abstract games sometimes play
Backgammon or Bridge then that is fine (though fans of Bridge who also like
other abstract games would be more likely to want to play Bridge at a Bridge
club!)  ... it would be somewhat surprising if several people who gathered
together at an evening of abstract games decided they wished to play
monopoly (on that evening).    In areas where there is no Go club I could
imagine that Go playing/teaching might be the main activity of such a club
but it would be somewhere where someone interested in other abstract games
might expect a warm welcome ... and that would be some achievement.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, club meetings can be open for a range of games.  Point is not
to be exclusive, but to advance abstract strategy games, while not
causing things to degenerate to a place where things become all things
and have no clear focus.  An IAGO club could serve as a way to get Go
in places where Go isn't now.  Object is to create a coattail where
new games can get exposure and played.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As regards International Tournaments sponsored by IAGO then that would be
down to the membership votes - and it would be surprising if they would
chose to sponsor events that focused primarily on games that already had an
existing organisational and tournament structure.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

At this moment, I am suggesting the IAGO World Tour, and anyone who
has a game that fits the criterion for a tournament can have one.
People vote with their feet what they will attend.  The focus is as
you have described, established organizations who can set up
tournaments or have them, or specific games with tournaments so far.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
PS Defining what an abstract game is for IAGO shouldn't be akin to creating
the rules of an abstract game - clear &amp; unambiguous.   It is a practical
matter - what are those attracted to IAGO happy to recognise as abstract
games or borderline abstract games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There will likely need to be multiple criterions.  I have a master
wiki list of games and sites.  I am also working on a more narrow
definition list, and then there will be tournament  list and
registered games.
