Considering all the features at bgg ag (pictures, game links, designer 
links, spoiler alerts, etc.) 
and the masses of bgg members, the "volume" you speak of is barely a 
trickle!  There are 1 and 2 day
gaps all over the place, including the past two days, and gaps of a week
or more on every page.

The topic was the quantity/quality of "abstract games" discussion in various forums. I stand by my assertion that BGG has a "significant"volume, given that the only real competitition is this rec.games.abstract and the activity here is not huge either.

The fact that BGG has good features and a huge userbase is not relevant: reddit is probably better in both aspects, but I don't see a significant abstract comunity there. Probably the topic is not popular overall.

What discussion there is is inane, such as Nestor promoting his
plagiarized bad games and stuffing
contests with them.  Ever considider limiting publishers to 1 game each?  
omg!  This is your idea of "significant discussion??" 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Evaluating "quality" of discussion is a quagmire that I won't enter. Who is the arbiter of what is significant or not ? If I find a discussion uninteresting or irrelevant, I simply don't partecipate. 
By proxy, the discussions that involve more people and with more activity are usually more significant.

You really should listen to Mo.  He's got more creativity than the rest 
of the bgg ag forum rats 
(including Christian Freeling) put together.  His advice won't be sugar 
coated, but if you want sugar coating, eat frosted flakes.  
If you want to actually learn something about abstract game 
design, open your ears and close your cake holes. 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I listen to everybody. I find the style of Mo not very conductive to proper discussion; in particular the many replies in short succession and the "black or white" approach. Nevertheless, I recognize he has good points at times. No need to sugar coat anything; the objective of discussion is to be productive and intellectually stimulating.

Christian Freeling checks for new posts in bgg ag every 1/2 hour, judging 
from his response times. 
Every post is an opportunity for him to commandeer the discussion and 
divert it to the only topic that interests him.  Himself.   
Forum rat: "Crappy weather in St. Luis today." 
Christian Freeling: "Oh that reminds me!  Me me me me me!!!!" 
Christian is such an extreme snot, he's incapable of actually 
"discussing" anything.  Other than himself, that is.  
The thing I don't understand is WHY??  He's had 95 years to come up with 
something original, yet his games are almost entirely variants.  But he 
still considers himself to be above it all.  Major Hillary Clinton 
syndrome.

Abstract Games Designers, in particular good ones, tend to be self-centered.. I'm sure you are aware of that.
However this has nothing to do with the quantity/quality of discussion at BGG. Even if you ignore all the posts from Christian, there is still a lot going on at BGG.

"Maybe you were wrong," megamau? lol  Is it really that hard for you to 
admit your mistakes?
ms_designer says he isn't Mo, and from what I can see there's no reason 
to doubt it.  The irony is
palpable. You've discounted the one guy who is capable and willing to 
help you (Mo) to such an extent that anyone who agrees with him must be 
his "sockpuppet."  Wise up!! 
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have no trouble admitting my mistakes. 
As of today I am still not certain if the "ms_designer" account is yours, a sockpuppet of Massakra or a third person altogether: that's why the "perhaps" is there. 
In any of the three cases, I won't discount his points "a priori": I prefer to evaluate the merits of a position instead of the people who present them.
