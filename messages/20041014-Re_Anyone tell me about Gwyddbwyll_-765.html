<br>Does anyone think that Gwyddbwyll and the irish game Fidchell are the same game?

<br>I'm replying to a 2-month old question, but I thought this might be 
interesting, much is excerpted from the info included with the game we 
sell based on the Ballinderry game board.
<br>
<br>Generally most sources I've read seem to associate Fidchell with 
tafl-style games, Although some do connect it to Ludus latrunculorum, so 
it is certainly subject to debate. To add to the confusion, according to 
game historian David Parlett, by the 15th century the Gaelic word 
Fidchell had commonly become adopted to refer to Chess. In the modern 
Irish spelling, Ficheall can now be used as a generic for any kind of 
wooden board game. In fact, in the Wooing of Etain, quoted below, the 
translators actually used the word Chess rather than "Fidchell."

<br>&nbsp;What is thy name? said Eochaid.
<br>Not famous, said he, Midir of Bri Leith.
<br>What has brought thee? said Eochaid.
<br>To play Fidchell with thee, said he.
<br>Of a truth I am good at Fidchell, said Eochaid.
<br>Let us make trial of it, said Midir.
<br>The queen is asleep, said Eochaid, and it is in her house that the 
Fidchell board is.
<br>I have here, said Midir, a Fidchell board that is not inferior. That 
was true: a silver board and golden men, and each corner there lit up by 
precious stones, and a bag for the men of plaited links of bronze.

<br>Here's a little more on Gwyddbwyll from my reading
<br>
<br>Gwyddbwyll, and Tawlbyrdd are both referred to in Welsh sagas. 
Fortunately a manuscript from 1587 in the Welsh National Library solves 
the mystery in regard to Tawlbwrdd. The description is unmistakably a 
Tafl-style game set on an 11x11 grid: The king in the center of the 
board and twelve men in the place next to him, and twenty-four lie in 
wait to capture him -with the 24 attackers equally spaced on the four 
edges of the board. The term Gwyddbwyll seems to be older than 
Tawlbwrdd. Part of the theory in regard to Latrunculorum is that 
Gwyddbwyll was its Welsh counterpart, and that Tawlbwrdd may have been a 
Tafl game imported by Norse and/or Saxon invaders and gradually replaced 
Gwyddbwyll.
<br>
<br>Here's a few other British/Celtic game names that are a puzzle to modern 
researchers.
<br>"Brandubh" (Black Raven) appears in the Irish sagas as early as the 12th 
century, one such source describes the use of 5 men against 8. This 
would seem well-suited to a small Tafl-like game played on a small grid 
like the Ballinderry board, or similar engraved boards found on the Orkneys.
<br>
<br>"Buanfach," "Cennchaem," "Conchobair," "Ard-ri"
<br>
<br>In the end, we have to remember that these were probably folk games 
whose rules could vary from one village to the next. We only have to 
look at the dozens of versions of Wari/Mancala to wonder if it is 
possible that all the names above were simply regional terms for just 
one or two games or their variants.
