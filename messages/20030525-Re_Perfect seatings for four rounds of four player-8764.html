As a tournament organizer, I am sometimes in need of good seating
systems for four player games and four rounds of play.  A player should
not meet each of the other players more than once and, if possible, all
players should play one round in each position.

I have managed to create perfect seatings for four rounds with 20 and 28
players, but is unable to create perfect seatings for 16, 24 and 32
players.  Please, can anyone help?

The following partial solution is from a post by "<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:warwick@cs.mu.oz.au">warwick@cs.mu.oz.au</a>
(Warwick HARVEY)" to sci.op-research and comp.constraints, dated 1998/06/05.
The title of the post was "Maximum socializing on the golf course".  The
players are labeled 1-9, A-G.

It meets your criteria that no players meet each other more than once.  It
does not address seating positions, though.  Choose any of four of the five
weeks for your rounds.

I suspect it would be pretty easy to find solutions for 24 and 32 players.
Easy to say without actually trying, though.
