    Okay, I've got a puzzle I need help with. Actually, it's my brother's
puzzle and it's driving him crazy. So, if anyone knows the solution to this
problem let me know. The object is to draw a line through every line but only
once. I know it sounds easy, but it isn't.

                  -----------------------
                  [          [          [
                  [    a     [    b     [
                  [          [          [
                  -----------------------       f
                  [     [         [     [
                  [  c  [    d    [  e  [
                  [     [         [     [
                  -----------------------

I know the drawing looks odd but it's supposed to be two boxes on top of three
boxes. It's an old puzzle, but I need to find out if there is a solution. Just

If you don't have to leave the frame (ie you don't enter region f) then the
answer is easy: a-&gt;c-&gt;d-&gt;a-&gt;b-&gt;d-&gt;e.  However, you already knew that, so now
including region f.  Here's a table of edges (lines to cross) for each region:
a    5
b    5
c    4
d    5
e    4
f    9
You don't have to think for very long to realise that each time you enter a
region you leave it next move, so except for the start and finish regions,
each region needs to have an even number of edges.  Look again at the table
and you see that it's not possible.

It's not too tricky to understand the above explanation once you've seen it
once.  What is surprising is that if the condition above is met, for whichever
compliant shape, then that shape will ALWAYS be traceable.  This is proved
using the Principal of Mathematical Induction.  I was shown it in the second
year of my BSc.

Similar problem (note phrasing):  Can you trace along the lines of this
diagram without tracing along any line more than once or lifting your
finger from the screen?

(the lines are supposed to meet wherever it looks like they are supposed to;
that's ascii for you!)
