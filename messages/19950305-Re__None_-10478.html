     Okay, I've got a puzzle I need help with. Actually, it's my brother's
puzzle and it's driving him crazy. So, if anyone knows the solution to this
problem let me know. The object is to draw a line through every line but only
once. I know it sounds easy, but it isn't.

I know the drawing looks odd but it's supposed to be two boxes on top of three
boxes. It's an old puzzle, but I need to find out if there is a solution. Just
e-mail me if you know how to solve it.

I think you can prove the unsolvability of this problem with graph theory.
Use the theorem that a path going through all points is only possible if
there are max. 2 points with an odd number of exits. (Can't remember if it
was an if or an if and only if). Use as points the middles of the squares,
and as exits the lines you have to cross. Then the upper left point has 5
exits, the upper right point also 5 exits, and the down middle point has
also 5 exits. Therefor there are 3 points with an odd number of exits. Hence
the puzzle is unsolvable.
Only left to proof the theorem, which is used. I think you can find that
proof in a book about graph theory.

My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.                            FEAR
I must master it as I must master my life.                          FACTORY
Without me my rifle is useless. Without my rifle I am useless.
