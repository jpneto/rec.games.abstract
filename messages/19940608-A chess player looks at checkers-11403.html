	Chess and checkers share much in common, for instance, extensive
literature on both games is maintained at the famous John G. White Collection
in Cleveland, as I discovered over a year ago. Pursuing this lead for a time,
I've come away with impressions of the game that may be of some interest to
net readers. These have been broken down by topic below. Pointers to further
exploration for the curious are given in section F.

A) Historical Affinities Between Chess and Checkers

	The rules for chess as we know it are only about 500 years old; there
was an abrupt change around the year 1500. Prior to that time, the queen moved
exactly one square diagonally, and the bishop two squares diagonally (there were
lesser differences also). Pieces with these original movements survive to
the present day in Chinese Chess and the very similar Korean Chess. Notice
that these moves correspond to checker moves and checker jumps! Besides the use
of identical boards, the notion of promotion on the back rank is also common
to chess and checkers, suggesting some sort of coevolution. Here is the
interesting part: When the rules for chess changed, the rules for checkers
did also and in a similar way. "International Checkers" as played in most of
Europe has kings that move like flying (chess) bishops, whereas the game played
in English-speaking countries ("draughts") retains the more limited movements.
(International Checkers later expanded the board size to 10x10.) My primary
concern here is with the English game.

	Both chess and checkers began to spawn written theory in the late
1700s. A (semi)professional class and dedicated journals and columns arose
soon thereafter. Checker theory, even more than chess theory, stresses
openings. There is also a well developed field of Checker Problem Composition,
with the difference that it is identical to the "Endgame Study" which is, as in
chess, somewhat practical. Simultaneous exhibitions and blindfold
play have been a staple form of entertainment in both games, though for
unknown reasons, blindfold play seems to have gone out of style long ago.

B) Nature of Game Strategy and Literature

	Checker annotations look rather strange at first. Squares
are numbered 1 to 32, and moves specified as 9-14, for example. This is
actually very easy to get used to. The moves of the game are not numbered, nor
is the commentary interspersed with the moves. Instead, the moves are listed
contiguously in columns, with certain of them labelled by letters A, B, C, etc.
that refer to comments given after the game. Position evaluation in checkers
is much more definite than in chess, with the precise losing move frequently
identified. Different plausible moves in opening positions are often
rank-ordered with seeming high confidence. Occasionally,
one sees comments such as "cramps White's double corner" and the like, but
there is not the same richness of vocabulary as in chess.
There are terms such as "bridges" and "elbows" and notions of easy draws vs
"thin" or "narrow" draws. It would be nice if the latter concept could be
formalized.

	In endings, the notion of "the move" (what chess players call the
"opposition") is fundamental. There are no sliding pieces, so it plays the
same prominent role as in pawn endings. Control of central squares is crucial
in openings and middlegames. Computers have demonstrated that chess is
mostly a tactical game of material. Bean counting, with a dozen or two vague
terms for positional factors, mildly selective search, plus lots of horsepower
is basically enough. This is even more true of checkers. Long term sacrifices
of a man for undefinable compensation are fairly uncommon. Sacrifices of
two checkers are invariably temporary and part of a combination.

	As in chess, annotators make copious references to past games, but
these are often spiced by gratuitous reminiscences of anecdotes from a half
century ago.

	Maximum solution depths of endings with different numbers of pieces
are comparable to chess. That is, 4-piece endings have instances of ~40 move
wins, while six-piece endings go well into triple figures. It is unfortunate
that the exhaustive databases being compiled by the Chinook team record only
win/loss information instead of the actual depth.

	The total number of positions in checkers is about equal to the square
root of the corresponding number for chess, as is the the typical number of
legal moves in a position. Consequently, computer programs search about twice
as deeply. However, humans search more deeply also! Although Chinook searched
a minimum of 20 ply with more than that along selected lines, the team had the
feeling they were frequently being outsearched by Tinsley in their London
match.

	Contrary to chess, talent is no substitute for knowledge. Absolute
precision is crucial, with few second chances available. All great
players are walking encyclopedias. The need to play for safety first in
unfamiliar positions led to great conservatism and a tendency for nearly
all games to end in a draw. To counteract this, the original Go As You Please
("GAYP") style of play was superseded at first by the two-move ballot, in
which the first move for each side was determined by lot. However, for the last
sixty years, "real" checkers has been three-move restriction. Since Red's
first two moves are essentially random, but only White's first move, in most
balloted openings, Red's position is already critical right from the start. This
is offset by having each player play both sides of the opening. Because of
deep opening knowledge, the low effective branching factor, and the generally
shorter length of the game, games are played fairly quickly. Standard practice
is for each round to consist of four games, all played in one day. There is some
controversy down to the present day concerning which of the possible sequences
are viable, but the number of valid openings has always remained in a narrow
band (137-150). Some current experimentation with previously barred openings
is taking place in postal play. Another method for compelling opponents to
enter uncharted waters is the 11-man ballot, in which one man on each side
is removed at random. Although this is a recognized specialty, it has never
achieved popularity.

C) Sociology

	Checkers has an undeservedly low reputation as a trivial game of old
men and little kids. The game has thus been in a decline for about 40 years, in
sharp contrast to chess, which has seen a huge influx of talented youth
worldwide. There is some life in the Midwest. The game's stronghold is in
the Deep South, with the coasts nearly dead. I'm not quite sure of the
situation in Britain, but suspect that matters have declined there as well.
There is a certain revival in progress in Ireland, and a positive boom in
Barbados, of all places. No doubt, this has much to do with Ron King taking
the GAYP title.

	Because of the low level of prestige associated with checkers, it is
even harder to make a living off that game than in chess. Its present day
masters all lead other lives, though a handful of players may have eked out
an existence in previous generations. The largest prize I have ever heard of
is $10000 (split  60/40) between Marion Tinsley and Chinook. (It seems that
International Checkers, which is in a healthy state, had a $100000 purse once.)

	Typical checker tournaments draw ~20 participants, with a few dozen
tournaments a year taking place somewhere in the country. The biennial
National Tournament draws many more, with this year's event to be held in Texas
in the summer. The other big tournaments are the Southern States tourney and
the Northern States tourney. The latter is usually played as far north as
Kentucky.

	The American Checker Federation maintains a rating system, seemingly
modeled on the Elo system. Marion Tinsley has a rating of 2812, with no other
human much closer than 200 points below. The distribution of ratings looked
much like the USCF distribution, but with the ratings bottoming out at a higher
level (i.e. there are relatively few ratings below 1700, instead of say, 1300).
It is hard to tell if it is because of the inherent nature of the game that
the the range is compressed, or simply because there are few novices joining
the pool.

	Checkers is dying. The ACF has about 1000 members currently, but I
think the number was something like 3000 10 years ago. (The USCF has 70000
members and thinks it's doing badly.) Every issue of the ACF Bulletin that I
flipped through had an obituary section. A number of checker periodicals have
ceased functioning over the years, owing to dwindling subscriptions. In the
past (i.e. 40 years ago), there were checker columns in the Cleveland Plain
Dealer, the Toronto Star Telegram, the Hartford Courant, and the Melbourne
Weekly Times. Perhaps readers in netland can tell me if any of these are still
functioning. A cursory look at stores specializing in games turned up almost
no book titles devoted to checkers. This is undoubtedly a substantial change
from earlier times. With most of the classics out of print, they have now
attained a certain value for collectors.

	The longevity of famous players is remarkable, with 30 year careers
common. Perhaps the most amazing of all is Asa Long. He won the American
(National) Tourney in 1920, held the World Championship form 1934 to 1948,
won the Nationals again as late as 1980 and 1984, and was twice Tinsley's
challenger for the title in the 80s. He competed in the Nationals in 1990,
emerging undefeated, and finishing third, behind Tinsley and Chinook. He also
drew a 20-game match with Chinook, 1-1. There is hardly any parallel to this
in any sport, just as Tinsley's record of a loss or two per decade out of
thousands of games is unique in its way.

	One of the more interesting personalities in the game who is not a
grandmaster is Charles Walker, founder of the International Checker Hall of
Fame in Petal, Mississippi. A successful career in the insurance industry
provided the means for constructing an extravagant edifice dedicated to
checkers. A great showman, he seems fond of getting into Elvis-type clothing and
giving 300-board simultaneous exhibitions to popularize the game and gain entry
into the Guiness Book of Records. He has also appeared as a guest on various
TV shows. In one hilarious episode on a game show, panelists had to determine
whether he was head of the Checker Hall of Fame, or a world record holder who
had succeeding in sucking the same Life Saver for six hours. Like Marion
Tinsley and others, he is also deeply involved in missionary work - for
Christianity.

D) Computers

	The first checker program was written in 1952 by Chris Strachey,
who was later known for his work on denotational semantics, among other things.
He didn't know alpha-beta, but stumbled into and described what amounted
to the "horizon effect", rediscovered, named, and discussed by Hans Berliner
twenty years later. The program ran at ~10 nodes per second.

	Arthur Samuel picked up the ball afterwards and wrote two famous papers
on machine learning in 1959 and 1967. The program was a milestone in AI, but
as a checker player, was greatly overrated by everyone except those who knew
the game. The field languished until the late 70s when the Duke University
team that wrote the "Duchess" chess program tried their hand at checkers.
This program was quite a bit stronger, but failed to impress the checker
community much, who issued a challenge comparable to the "Levy bet" in chess.
It was never accepted.

	Nothing happened after that until J. Schaeffer started up the work
on Chinook a few years ago. In 1990, a paper of his claimed that already in
the opening, deep searches under tournament time controls were hitting
positions in his 6-piece database. The claim was that the program was getting
close to solving the game. On the other hand, the same paper admitted that
even a 48 hour search failed to understand the key move in the "White Doctor"
opening. In any case, the 8-piece database is almost finished, but Chinook still
lost a recent match to Don Lafferty, perhaps the #2 human in the world.

	Other programs include Checkers 3.0, SAGE, and Colossus, all running on
micros and commercially available. They are of grandmaster strength. Chinook
defeated Colossus 9-2 in a 50-game match, proving again that perfection has
not yet been achieved. The latter, in turn, defeated the World Mail Champion
1-0 in a 14-game match. The loser thought the result just, with the program
having introduced a number of opening innovations. However, another Mail player
trounced Colossus 2-0 with two draws, so the era of absolute machine
superiority may yet be postponed for a short time.

E) Miscellaneous

	Apropos of some recent discussions in rgc, the custom in the checkers
"fraternity" (as they like to call it) is to consider game scores as private
property, at least informally. It was considered a scandal early in the century
when the scores of a big international match were published by somebody other
than the organizers. Some of the clauses in world championship matches would
state that the winner gets say, $3000 and the right to publish the match book.
For major tournaments and matches, donations are solicited, with donors getting
early copies of the unannotated games. Eventually though, the games, with
commentary, find their way into the public domain.

	The official color scheme is Red and White. The squares should be
green and buff, not the horrible red squared things sold in stores. Tournament
chess boards are probably fine.

	There seems to be no three-time repetition rule. Instead, a player can
request a referee to intervene if nothing is happening on the board. The other
player then has 40 moves (his? both players together?) to strut his stuff or
concede the draw.

	Tinsley is said to be able to play 20 simultaneous blindfold games.
A hundred years ago, Harry Nelson Pillsbury used to play 12 chess games and 6
of checkers simultaneously while blindfolded and taking part in a game of
duplicate whist, this according to a biography of him.

	I don't know if club players play blitz checkers, not having been to
a club. Does anyone out there know?

F) How to Find Out More

	The key institution is the American Checker Federation, at

		Post Office Drawer 365		Tel.: (601)582-7090
		Petal, Mississippi
		39465

Members receive six issues a year of the Bulletin, a 20-30 page or so nonglossy
magazine produced in looseleaf binder format. Annual membership is $20. Most
issues of the Bulletin contain classified ads for merchandise and books
posted by members.

	Membership is necessary to compete in tournaments. This summer (July 27
to Aug. 6), Garland, Texas will host the 1994 "Checkerthon", with the biennial
Nationals and the Southern States event being held at the same place a few days
apart. The action will take place at the Ramada Inn in Garland, near Dallas.
The prize fund will approach five figures. Since I've never visited a checker
tournament in progress, an eywitness acount would be interesting.

	The International Checker Hall of Fame is currently located at the
same address and phone number, but is a distinct institution. I did manage to
pay for membership in both organizations with one check. Membership costs $25
annually, entitling one to the annual issue of "Checkers" magazine. Although
the quality of photo reproduction is low, the magazine is quite satisfactory in
all other respects, and weighs in at well over 200 pages. The ICHF also sells
various paraphernalia, and hosts/promotes Pool Checkers and the International
form, as well as Draughts. It looks like it might be an interesting tourist
stop for anyone zipping through Mississippi.

	The premier checker library in the world is the John Caldwell - Irving
Windt Library of Checkers in Dubuque, Iowa. Their number is (319)556-1944,
for those who wish to visit or ask for research help. They also welcome gifts
of books, memorabilia, or cash, all tax-deductible.

	An old (50's vintage) Brittanica article stated that the world's
largest checker library was at the George F. Wales Foundation in Buffalo, N.Y.
I haven't seen a more recent reference to this library. Perhaps a kind
netreader in the area can look into the matter and find out
what became of it. I hadn't seen any reference to the checker collection at
the John G. White either, but it is sizable, containing also numerous titles
on checker variants. Incidentally, the modern day Brittanica contains only
scanty information on checkers, whereas the 40 year old edition had a meaty
four page article.

G) Wanted

	Someone once posted on rec.games.abstract a long discussion of all the
checker variants and their rules. A repeat would be welcome, together with
a short discussion of the history and state of each version, analogous to this
post.

	The chess FAQ says that Sam Sloan's history of chess is not generally
accepted. Since his arguments are semi-convincing, it would be nice if the
FAQ writer could add a short rebuttal. In that connection, does anyone know
if Burmese chess exists? Sloan says all references to such a beast are misnamed
and identical to other known variants, but one software company was selling
a program for it and several other chess-related games.
