Take a look at Cephalopod.  People have commented that it's Chess like,
even though it has nothing to do with Chess.  It's something about your
choices and how far you can look ahead, etc.  People concentrate on
their moves and take a long time.  It's like watching a Chess game.
I've also designed a couple of games which use a Checkers board, but
I'd recommend Cephalopod as the most natural fit.

   Just tried it out. Pretty neat!  I did think that the 3x3 game was
actually more fun than the 5x5, because with the 5x5 there seemed to
be more moves that were forced, or just "waiting for tempo" --- you
know, when there are 7 good moves left, and you have to alternate
placing pieces in those 7 spots before someone is forced to concede
a "six" to his opponent, and the game can get interesting again.

   FYI --- this is obvious but might be worth mentioning anyway ---
you don't need a bunch of dice to play Cephalopod, either. We played
with stacks of Reversi (Othello) pieces, using chess pawns to represent
immobile "sixes" so we didn't run out of pieces.

Thank you.  I generally only play the 5x5 version since it seems like a
richer game.  Also now playing 3D Cephalopod (5x5x3) on
SuperDuperGames.org.  That's a ridiculously difficult game.
Interesting about the Reversi pieces and pawns instead of dice.  Good
thinking.
