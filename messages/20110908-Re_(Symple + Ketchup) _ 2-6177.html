I've got mixed thoughts about this. On one hand, the placement
mechanism in this game could be an interesting modification to Yodd,
since it would necessarily increase the average number of groups in
the final position, which can't be a bad thing.

On the other hand, just adding the Yodd goal to this game (I ought to
find a name for it) wouldn't probably result in a very interesting
game. In Yodd, the ability to drop stones of both colors is what gives
the players dynamic connection goals, which in turn provide the
necessary incentive to do something else than growing one single group
throughout the game. In the Symple-Ketchup mix, you can only drop
stones of your color, so the Yodd goal wouldn't work.

No it wouldn't, but it feels like a dynamic connection goal mechanism
just the same. That, by the way, is how I feel the difference between
a 'mechanism' and an 'organism': try to find what the mechanism wants
and you got an organism.
