Classification what is a `chess variant' seems a hard task. For many criteria,
one can come up with examples that show that the criterium is somewhat
`wrong'.

For example, if we look to the goal of the game, what about Losing chess?
Seems a `chess variant' to me? (Rules: chess, but capture obligatory, and
winning by getting rid of all your pieces; kings not royal.)

In fact, for about every criterium, you could take FIDE-chess, and modify it
only slightly just to make that criterium wrong, and often get something that
feels like a variant of chess.

Giving a classification of what is a `chess variant' thus is rather hard, and
I think it'll be impossible to find one that satisfies everybodies taste.

Forget about standards that don't fit into reality. Gala has two "kings",
Chu Shogi has a potential second "king" and in Tamerlane's Chess there
is a potential second and even a potential third "king" (called
"prince" and "adventititious king" in the English translation).
But you are right: USUALLY (but not NECESSARILY) a chess variant has only
one "king". But this only defines a further subcategory within the family
of chess variants: you have variants with only one king (i would call this
family "mono-chess") and you have variants with at least the potential of
several "kings" ("poly-chess"!!!). Gess is a modern poly-chess variant.

This is modern western chess. In eastern chess variants as well as in
Shatranj you are (were) allowed to capture (kill) the opponent's "king".
You can move the king into check or capture with your king and -- at
the same time -- move into check.
Usually, however, this is not considered a good idea, because you would
lose the game. However, this can be a good move in variants which has
at least two two "kings".

Sorry, I actually meant pure abstract games which involve no element of
"luck". So i can't tell you much about role-playing games. Nomic is a
fascinating game, but difficult to describe. There might be even people
who question that Nomic is a game at all... Nevertheless, playing a game is

and "virtual" life are not that fixed as many people believe ...)  For
that reason it might be difficult to think of a game (or any action) which
has no "goal", although this goal may be hidden, not expressed in written
words, etc. Let us think together what people who play Nomic want to achieve....

Only some few. Havannah is an example (connection game AND a forming
geometric shape). If have described 120 games in my abstract games book
project, and I think there are only three hybrids. Don't forget that there
are final goals (which decide who has won the game; Go --&gt; territory) and
instrumental goals (goals that help you to achieve the final goal; Go --&gt;
connection). My classification system is only based on the final goal.

One thing we could discuss further: Draughts has a primary final goal --&gt;
capture all opponent's men, but also a secondary final goal --&gt; blockade
your opponent so that he cannot move. I decided to ommit this secondary
goal in my classification of board games. However, this secondary goal I
just mentioned is the primary and only final goal in some abstract games,
e.g. Juego de los Amazonas or Forge. I describe these games as a
particular sub-group of territory games (!). I think that the ability to
make moves is a subtle  "measure" of territory.

Your system would seem to divide

I don't think so, except the hybrids. It is a very hierarchical
system and the graphs look like a tree.

Not a problem, but I would rather see you talk about families than
variants.  To call one game a variant of another seems quite insulting
to the designer, unless it is quite clear that the original game was the
model for the newer one.

You are exaggerating excessively. I know that many game inventors believe
that their game is "totally" unique and the best game ever invented. At
least this is what they write (sometimes) in their homepage. Go to
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.chessvariants.com">www.chessvariants.com</a> and take a look at Bodlaender's chess variants.
He is much more inclusive than I am, although he has not included
Gipf. For instance, Racing Kings and Alapo is in my system a base row
game, not a chess variant (BTW, there are three sub-groups: reach your
opponent's base row (.e.g. Epaminondas, Camelot, Alapo, Phutball), a common
base row (e.g. Racing Kings, Dodo Chess, Chessball), your own base row (with
a neutral piece! -- Neutron).
