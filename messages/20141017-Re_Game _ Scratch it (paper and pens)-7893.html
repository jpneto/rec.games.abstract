You do not need to know it.
Adjacency is required ONLY when you build your connected scratches.
You did not fully understand the rules.
Here is how it works :
1- Initiating the number of squares to connect (you choose any empty square)
2- Choosing the starting point (any empty square not necessarly adjacent to the previuos one) to connect 2 or more (those squares have to be ADJACENT)
- After that you choose then ANy other empty square to order your opponent how many squares to scratch.

Why all those rules?
To allow the players to open new "battle" fields.
If you choose to impose a continued adjacency the game will be shorter.
The new square choosen is a strategic choice itself.
