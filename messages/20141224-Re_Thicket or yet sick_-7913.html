A crappy game Thicket which add nothing to the classical game Dots and Boxes (DAB) recommended by 13 guys!!! Worse than that it makes a caricature of DAB not an artistic one but an ugly one. 

Thicket game recommended By 
ekted | qswanger | simpledeep | christianF | mrraow | CDRodeffer | CrocWrestler | Martinus | fogus | pled | orangeblood | Eric Brosius | CarlosLuna | 

13 guys thumbing up this crappy game.
Even Freeling is thumbing up the game.
Where is Russ? 

The rules of the game Thicket were changed many times with some big mistakes no one noticed (in one picture the red played 2 turns more than the blue!!! ha ha ha).
Until now no one knows when the board is full.
Until now no one claimed to have playtested the game. So what? People are so dumb that they thumb up a game they never played.

When I (Massakra52) intervened to say what other people are hiding (who knows why) they banished me for 1 month.

I will not shut up!
