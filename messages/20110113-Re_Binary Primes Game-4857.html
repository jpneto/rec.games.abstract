This is a game for two players.

Start by drawing an n-by-n grid on paper. (I don't suggest that n be
too big, unless you are playing this game on a computer.)

The players take turn filling in squares, each player filling in one
empty square per move.
Each player fills in floor(n^2/4) squares total.
(So, 2*floor(n^2/4) squares are filled in all together at the game's
completion.)

Now, interpret the filled-in (black) squares and the blank (white)
squares in each row and column as the digits of a binary number. In
any particular row or column, either all the black squares represent a
0 or all of the black squares represent 1. And the white squares each
equal the opposite binary digit than the black squares represent in
that row/column. And the binary number can be read either top to
bottom, or bottom to top (for each column), or left to right, or right
to left (for each row).

Player 1 gets as a score the product of all of the primes in the

If n is even, player 2 can force all the columns to be composite as
follows: whenever player 1 plays (i,j), play ((i + n/2) mod n, j).
So, at least for even n, optimal play must result in a tie or a win
for player 2.

(If player 2 follows that specific strategy, it's easy enough for
player 1 to force a tie.  My guess would be that this is also the
outcome of optimal play by both players, although I can't quite prove
that just now.)

Thanks for pointing this out. I am amending the rules to require that
n be odd as a result. Is it possible to force a win if n is odd, in
general?


Wait, I just saw Don Del Grande's response [where he points out that
for the n=8 case,
we can still get the number 17 via "ooo*ooo*", say, even with Ilmari's
strategy].
A win for player 2, though, can be forced whenever n is even and not
of the form 2^m, and
for most n = 2^m, but not when 2^(n/2) + 1 is a Fermat prime.
Right?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
