SuperDuperGames got so lagged out that nobody can stand to play there anymore - extremely unfortunate and totally aggravating.  For years it was, "Yeah I'm planning an upgrade.  Russ is building a server farm, etc., etc., etc.."  Then it just fucking fizzled out because Aaron got tired of working on it.

I wish Aaron would try to find someone to turn the site over to who could get it up to speed.  So close yet so fucking far.  I'm really pissed off about that.  For a long time there was a symbiosis between me and Aaron.  I'd invent a game and he'd add it.  That's what spurred my design surge.  I guess that's the good part about it.  I ended up with a bunch of interesting games.

Still, when you're promised something year after year, and you're waiting with high hopes year after year, and then it just fucking dries up, it's fucking irritating.
