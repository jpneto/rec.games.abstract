Another possibility is to use speed chess as "Overtime", like the

I'd much rather see joint champions declared than have ever-more
ludicrous tie-breaks used to separate them.

Ok, do joint champion then, and the first one to get defeating in a
chess tournament ends up losing their title, making the other
champion the regular champion.  The player who beat one of the
champs gets a title shot against the champion.  You need a regular
chess schedule to make this work.

Ah.  Hmm.  The question of `so how do you decide who the next champion
is?' rather blows the joint champions idea out of the water...

Doubling certainly wouldn't work in a tournament -- somebody might
well win the tournament just because his opponent stubbornly kept
redoubling in a lost position.  I don't think it's a good idea in
matches, either.  Doubling works in backgammon because small
mistakes and bad luck can cause the lead in a game to be exchanged
back and forth between the players.  There's no luck in chess and
mistakes tend to be more serious so it's not so common for the
players to trade the lead.  Usually, one player or the other builds
up a steadily growing advantage and the question is whether his
opponent will be able to hang on for a draw, not whether the leader
will make a mistake and let his opponent win.

Point here is to drive a game to closure, and have each game advance
the reaching of a closure point.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If the sole goal is to drive every game to closure, why not replace
the bit where they move the silly pieces of wood around the chequered
board with a simple toss of a coin?  The point is that the result
should depend somehow on chess and make sense in the context of
chess.  Doubling does not make sense in the context of chess for the
reasons I outlined.

The changes [to the laws of chess] will have worked, when the rest

You've lost me.  How on earth is chess akin to calculus?  Is it just
an example of something that the man on the street doesn't understand
but thinks is probably important?
