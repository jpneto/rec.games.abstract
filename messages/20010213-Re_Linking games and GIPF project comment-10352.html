What I am interested in finding out about any sort of games that involve
a linking of "equal" level games. That is to say, each game is an
independent game and then, by some alteration of rules or additional
pieces, the games can be joined into forming a larger game.

The fictional game of Azad (introduced by Iain M Banks in 'The Player Of
Games') gets close as well, although there again there are a series of
smaller games / boards that provide elements / advantages leading into the 3
bigger boards, which are played sequentially, not simultaneously, but are
all linked. I wonder if Iain is ever going to put the rules up at the
Boardgame Geek database ...
