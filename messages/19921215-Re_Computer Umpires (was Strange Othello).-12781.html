Has anybody written a computer game which involves guessing computer
generated rules?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I had a boxed game from that company that made Wff'n'Proof -- whoever they
were -- which was supposed to teach the skills one used to puzzle out
the syntax of strange languages.  It had rolls and rolls of tiddly-winks
that were fun to play with until I was old enough to puzzle out the rules
of the game -- lucky me, child of professors.  But the way this game, whose
name I can't remember either (this posting is turning into a trivia question
in itself -- whoever correctly named all the unnamed objects referred to in
it gets to buy a package of Ramen Noodles for only a quarter...) worked, was
that one player set up a system of rules, then the other player presented
a series of constructions and was told if they were consistent with the rules
or not -- like MASTERMIND and the four colored pegs, but with a different
and more subtle object.  Armed with the rules to that game, which may or may
not still be in production, computer generating play (both sides) shouldn't
be really too very tricky.
