Rive's game tree is huge in comparison with its boardsize, on any

Of coures, Christian.  Sorry about the haphazard claim.  Finite and
infinite.  Apples and oranges.  I was thinking of the practical use portion
of the Go tree - Go with superko which by definition means players can't
repeat a position with the same player on turn - and carelessly abbreviated
the notion to Go game tree.

Certainly two cooperating players could keep Go with superko going for a
long, long time.  As far as which has a bigger tree, Go or Go-sized Rive? 
Probably Go.  But the disparity wouldn't be so cavernous as to make Rive
seem Tic-Tac-Toe-like in comparison.  Or maybe it would.  Just speculating.

So it's the other way around actually: in your metaphor, Rive
is Tic-tac-toe :)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If you consider the practical portions of the two game trees, it's possible
to sit down and play Go in a couple/few hours.  This isn't possible with
Go-sized Rive.  We're talking days/weeks/months/years.  In this sense, in
the practical play sense, Rive makes Go look like a smell molecule tenuously
attached to a fly speck.
