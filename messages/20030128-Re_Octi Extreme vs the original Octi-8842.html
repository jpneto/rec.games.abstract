I had a nice bit of correspondence with Don Green about that--he's very
pleasant, and I gather from his comments that The Great American Trading Co.
gets things manufactured in Not so-Great-at-manufacturing China.  The boards
only fit in the lids of the boxs, not the bottoms.  You can make sure you
don't worsen the warp, in my limited experience, by storing the box in the
lid, the rest of the components on top, and then store the whole thing
upside down somewhere, using the bottom as a lid.  Stupid, but effective, at
least after you've unwarped the board....  GATCO at least was kind enough to
send me a copy of the rules which were missing from my shrinkwrapped, unused
set.  Cheap annoying components for a very, very cool game.  I think I'd
rather find an old Tinkertoys set though, and check out the original
inspiration.
