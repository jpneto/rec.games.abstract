Hello.
I recently came across a very brief description of a chess variant called Alice
Chess, named in connection to Lewis Carrol's character from Wonderland. It is
apparently based somewhat on ideas in Through The Looking Glass. The game is
played on two boards: all pieces start on the same board, but after a piece 
moves, it transferred to the corresponding square on the other board. 
	Anyway, I was wondering if anyone out there has heard of it, and knows 
any more about the rules. What I want to know in particular is: When you move
to a square on one board which is occupied on the other, what happens? Is the
move disallowed? Does the piece <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> change boards? If the piece is an
opponents piece, is it taken? 
	This is how I think the game is played, and how I think it works best.
A piece can end its move on a square if and only if that square is unoccupied
on the other board, and either
  a) that square is unoccupied on the current board, or
  b) that square is occupied by an opponent's piece on the current board, in
which case the opponent's piece is taken and then the player's piece is
transferred. This means that a move cannot end on a square that is occupied by
any piece on the other board, and this works best for play as far as I have
tried it.

	The game has much more strategy to it than ordinary chess, as the 
pieces can seem to pop in and out of each playing area. So, for example, once
in 'checkmate' on one board, the king could move one square and pop to the 
other board, or another piece could move on the other board and pop up to block
the checkmate. Checkmate can also extend over both boards, which is quite a 
novel idea. Anyway, if anyone has more info on the correct rules, it would be
greatly appreciated.

"Yes, yes I did, Min."
"Good. It's very hot tonight... I think I'll have a cold water bottle instead."
