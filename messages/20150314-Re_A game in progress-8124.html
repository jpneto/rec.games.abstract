Here is an idea of game.

First : the mover counters. 

Every token has k holes. On each hole a player can place a stone. So the token can move only up to k squares. A value of k will depend heavily on the size of board.
At the setup all the token carry each one k stones.
This condition will give to the players a freedom on where to move. A player can move a token in an direction one per move. As the player move a token he has to remove as many stones as the moves. 3 moves = 3 stones less.
No jumping is allowed.
No pass is allowed.
 
Second : Refueling 

As the token moves it has less stones. So at some step (zero stone) a token can not move (run out of stones). Here comes the second idea : refueling.. A token can be refueled as it capture an opponent token by using its opponents captured stones to refuel. Friendly adjacent stone to the capturor token can be refueled too.

Third : Capturing system

A token can capture ONLY an adjacent token carrying the same number of stones or less. A token can either move from a cell to another or capture. On his turn a player perform one of the 3 actions :

- move 
- refuel 
- capture and refuel 

A token stone-free can not capture nor move. Must wait to be refueled to move or capture or refuel.

Using all those concepts the goal is to find :
- which kind of board will be optimal?
- witch kind of cell will be optimal : triagular, square, n polygon (n&gt;4)
- witch winning condition : last one to make legal move? annihilation of your opponent? scoring system at the end of the game?

Until now I have my ideas about how to build the game : on what to focus in particular.

I do not care about the originality of the game. Was it done before or not?
I still can introduce some new mechanism when it comes to the tiny details.

What I want is : few rules, no flaws, few pieces, at most 3 kind of pieces, a game duration around one hour, 

Those are my main ideas for now.
I will update each time I reach an answer.

Maybe I will not need to add the refueling cells (cells where players could store stones to be used only if some condition to define is fullfilled).
Because if the skill levels are similar the game be balanced by the fact that a player A captures slightly the same number of stones than the player B..
If the difference of skills is big than for sure one the player will decide earlier the win.
If you playtest only 1 token per player (with 9 stones) in a board 3*3 then you will see which capturing rule is better. Can a player flee the other one indefinitely without being captured? 
After that you complicate the game by adding tokens per player in the same board size.
For sure it will soon appear which size is optimal.
I had headache this morning so I`m unable to focus on.
