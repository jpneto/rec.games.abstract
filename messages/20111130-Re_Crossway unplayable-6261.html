I don't. His schtick is "genius by design". Actually playing it with
other people and getting feedback on gameplay just means potential
enragement if his genius isn't immediately recognized. Also, you need
to play at a decent level to evaluate a game; Steere's ego is way too
big to invest in something as risky as trying to get really good in
his games: what if he should fail?

Even more spluttering, overcompensating rage, that's what would
happen. No, Steere being what he is, it's good that he plays as little
as possible.

Of course, Crossway isn't broken. It's too technically similar to Hex
for that. But neither is it particularly interesting for players (due
to its gameplay similarity to far more popular connection games).
