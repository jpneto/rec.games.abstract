You might as well say Go and Chess are
tessellation independent -- both of which have been ported to other
tessellations.

Man, you're making a lot of racket for someone who wants to remain
anonymous.

Let's assume that somewhere in that voluminous tirade you've made the
point that tessellations matter.  Ok, fine.  The principles of
fundamental connection games can usually be demonstrated with a blank
sheet of paper and a pen - no tessellation whatsoever.  The
tessellation is an afterthought.  Sometimes a game will present
certain challenges in selecting a tessellation, such as Torus (which
challenge I've now solved in another post, Freestanding Torus).

Hex for example can be played on an unlimited variety of
tessellations, and there are probably subtle differences in the
gameplay among them.  But it's still essentially the same game, no
matter what tessellation it's played on.  Now take Atoll.  It's
fundamentally different from Hex.  There are eight segments instead of
four.

What you're saying is daddy bought you a yellow Lamborghini, you
burned up a set of Michelins and a set of Goodyears, and then you
spraypainted it green.  And now you claim to have created a whole new
class of automobiles.  Get a clue Mr. Anonymous!
