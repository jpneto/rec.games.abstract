Another similar game which comes to mind is an arcade-game (IIRC) snakes where
you steer a moving "snake" around the board.  The snake gets longer as the
game progresses.  If you run into a wall or into the body of the snake, you
lose.

The arcade game you are (probably) recalling was named "Hustle".  When I was
at MB around 1980, we licensed the title and produced a version of it for
the TI home computer.  There are a godzillion java variants of it on the web
these days, with about as many different names.  I wouldn't be surprised if
it was in a couple of those 'learn how to program games in java or basic or
c++ or assembly language" books.
