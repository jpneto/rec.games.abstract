This game, LINK, is very similar to TWIXT, mentioned here several times.
I imagine it is more slow-moving than twixt, however.

It is a game I invented some while ago, though never played. Doubtless it has
been independently invented many times. It is an attempt to create a game
close to the connection game, HEX, but played on an orthogonal board. It is
essentially the same as hex, but to ensure a result, (no ties), there is a
twixt-like move available, whereby one may connect two diagonally adjacent
cells of one's own color, instead of a regular placement move.

I have never played it, as I say; but if anyone is interested in trying an
email game, I would be very keen.

Naturally, rule 1, board size, is open to negotiation; and I would suggest
a three-move equalization (described here earlier) would be suitable
to counteract the obvious first-move advantage.


RULES OF LINK
=============
1. It is played on an orthogonal 8x8 board, by two players, black &amp; white.

2. Black has first turn. At each turn a player may EITHER put a counter of his 
   own color in any vacant square; OR connect two diagonally adjacent counters 
   of his own color with a bar of his own color, PROVIDED that such a bar does 
   not cross over one of the opposite color. 

3. The winner is the first player to complete a path of stones between his
   own two edges of the board: north-south for black, east-west for white. 
   A path is a sequence of stones each of which is either orthogonally
   adjacent to its predecessor or connected to it by a bar.
=============


 . O X .  I hope the rules are suitably unambiguous, and not too long-winded.
    /     It should be clear there is an unlimited supply of counters and bars
 X X O .  available. A bar may not be placed if either end is vacant.
    \ \
 . O X O  The diagram here shows a completed game on a 4x4 board. Black has a
          won with a 4-counter 2-bar path. Black has played 7 moves and white 6.
