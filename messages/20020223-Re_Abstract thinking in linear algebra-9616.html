If they were really bright then (1) it wouldn't be
counterproductive because a bright person can always find,
derive and learn something (even something which is or was
not known by anyone else before) from their immersion in
even the most "mundane" and "concrete" applications.

If not then they're not too bright, to begin with.

And (2) if they were really bright, it wouldn't be a drill
in the first place, because they'd have long before found a
faster and more efficient way to finish up the assignment.

Let me give you a concrete instance.

Suppose a company decided one day to take all their best and
brightest employees and have them do a stint on the factor
floor in assembly.

Here's one of the processes.  You're to remove a box from a
carrying platform, and open it up.  One by one, take an item
from inside the box (let's say there's 6), open it up, remove
its contents -- consisting of a unit, power supply other stuff
and the packing materials.  Place the unit on the testing
conveyor, place the power supply on a crate and put the
other stuff in a 3rd place and the emptied box at the end of
the line so that the next person can use it to recrate the stuff.

Now ... these so-called bright people are being asked to do a
couple days of this.  All you hear is the grumbling ("I didn't
go to [sic] college (actually trade school) to learn how to
program so I could end up doing this", or "how is this going
to help me?") and various other gripes you typically get like
when a spoiled Hollywood is asked to do some restaurant work in
the kitchen.

But the REALLY bright one proceeded to do this:

  (1) Grab ALL the boxes off the carrying platform (let's say 6 of them)
  (2) Simultaneously turn them ALL upside down, and let the
      contents slide out
  (3) Place all the boxes on the other end
  (4) Line up all 36 of the items dumped out and in rapid-fire sequence
      cut them all open (floor space required)
  (5) Sort the items into heaps
  (6) Take the 36 items in the unit heap and place them all on the
      conveyor
  (7) Take the 36 items in the power supply heap and place them all
      on the power supply crate
  (8) Place the 36 items of the 3rd heap on the 3rd crate
  (9) Offer assistance to the people down the line or otherwise take
      a break while they finish up with your stuff -- because you ended
      up averaging 3 TIMES FASTER than the norm!

And no, it's not multidimensional.  This is the SAME brightness that
made this person so damn good at their work where, in fact, their
performance is showing the very same 3-fold, 4-fold, etc. disparity;
as well as in nearly every other task he performs.
