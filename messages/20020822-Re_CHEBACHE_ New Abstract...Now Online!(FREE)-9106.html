Dear Carl Joan,

I've nothing to add to your remarks. BTW I love your interest for Trax
which is a beautiful game. Have seen your photo taken at the tournament.
You are second in the world ranking list aren't you? Too sad that Sweden
is so far away, but I will probably move to northern Germany and would
like to visit cohousing communities (kollektivhuset) in Sweden in the
next two years.

Perhaps we can meet some day for a Trax game, if you don't mind that
I'm a lousy player.

Do you know the inventor of Gomullo? Isn't he Swedish too? I'Ve heard that
you have great Othello players in your country too. Must be great to live
there...

Ralf
