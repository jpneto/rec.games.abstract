Hi,

2 comments:

1) Have you considered making the score the number of moves required
to achieve the goal pattern?  In this case it would still be 6, but
for a different reason because it took 6 moves to get there.  This
would encourage risk taking to defer a win until a later move.

2) Is it possible that the sequence could be exhausted without a win?

1) Hmmm. Interesting variation. There is already risk-taking, though,
during some games with my variation, because a player may hold out for
a better position later. (My example round shows player 1 taking such
a risk, and losing.)

2) I am pretty sure every round leads to someone winning. Remember,
you change however many squares' states you need to to ensure a unique
pattern. And all patterns must be unique. So, eventually, since the
number of moves per round is finite, a pattern will be achieved where
one player wins. 2n patterns, for n number of squares per row, are end-
moves, out of 2^n possible patterns total.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
