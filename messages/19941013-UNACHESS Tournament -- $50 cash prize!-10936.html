***First Ever UNACHESS World Championships***

The first ever Unachess tournament will be held by email. There is no
entrance fee -- its absolutely free! The first place winner gets $50 US
cash money and a certificate giving her or him the title of World Unachess
Champion! The only requirements are that all moves from all games must be
recorded and emailed to me when the game is decided. The form of the 
tournament will depend on the number of entrants. We expect the contest to
begin by November 1st and last two to three months.


Each contestant is also encouraged to make any comments, criticisms,
or suggestions about the game of Unachess. Any questions, please ask.

I will post the rules to Unachess following this post.

To enter, just email me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:ejackman@delphi.com">ejackman@delphi.com</a> and tell me you
want to compete in the tournament.

Thank you very much and good luck.



Edward Jackman + Jeff Miller
