Most are described in the old Harkness Handbook, but for Giveaway you
might want to define the winner as the person with no legal moves,
i.e, having only a blocked pawn at the end is a win.  

Kamakazie is another good one.  Place a partition between 4th &amp; 5th ranks
while the players arrange their pieces any way they want.  Castling only
permitted if king is placed on e1 or e8 with a rook on "R1".  The
partition is lifted and the clock (usually 5 min) is started.  Combine
this with Kriegspeil and I guess you can call the game WWII. 

Two for one:  White gets a king on e2 and pawns on c3, d3, e3, &amp; f3;
but gets 2 moves for each one by Black.  Unlike Scotch Chess (described
in Harkness), White can be in check after his 1st move as long as
the king is safe at the end of the move.  Similar to "fox &amp; geese"
in &lt;dare I say it?&gt; checkers.
