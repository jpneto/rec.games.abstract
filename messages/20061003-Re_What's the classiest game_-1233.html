<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting Bruno Wolff III's message of Yesterday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Expert players of rock-paper- scissors (yes, there are such) will 
detect your patterns and beat you fairly consistently.
<br></blockquote></blockquote>
<br><blockquote type=cite>If BOTH players want to try to engage in a meta game of who can 
outguess the other, then they can aggree to do so. But either one can 
opt out by choosing randomly.
<br></blockquote>
<br>If Chris's statement above is true, then it requires both players to 
play randomly before it becomes a game of true luck, and in that case it 
differs little from chess or draughts, if treated with similar contempt 
by the players.
<br>
<br>If just one player chooses to play randomly, then it becomes a sort of 
asymmetrical game - one player is rewarded by skill in pattern matching, 
while the other is rewarded by skill in generating true randomness 
which, as Chris pointed out, isn't as easy as it sounds.
<br>
<br>Not that any of this makes me think of it as a classy game.
