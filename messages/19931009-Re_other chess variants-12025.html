*Salt Shaker Chess. Good for playing in restaurants.

Ah, that brings back memories of my undergraduate days, where
hordes of us spent much time at all night restaurants, imbibing
stimulants, discoursing upon matters of great significance but no
importance whatever, and playing games.

One such evening, when all of us had forgotten our Xiang Qi sets,
I and a friend set about playing Spiel with the Salt and Pepper
Shakers and sugar packets.  Since there are only 6 pieces on an
8x8 grid, if one were careful, which we were, one can dispense
with the chessboard.  Neither I nor my friend bothered to explain
the game to the onlookers, who amused themselves attempting to
deduce the rules  (If I remember them, I'll post them, but I
haven't so much as thought of the game in years).

After the eighth or ninth game, which I saw I was about to lose,
I looked my opponent square in the eye, raised an eyebrow, and
introduced the ketchup bottle into the game.  Amid the oohs and
ahs of the onlookers, he looked back at me, and countered with
the mustard pot.  Whilst I was contemplating this turn of events,
my righthand neighbor and erstwhile kibitzer emplaced the oil and
vinegar cruets.  Things progressed in this vein for a few more
moves, until my opponent's lefthand neighbor, a somewhat
sensitive soul, ran screaming from the room.  Since he was the
one of the DDs for the evening, the game was adjourned while we
ran out to the parking lot and attempted to pacify him.

Now I think it is time for me to go to Mornington Crescent to
catch the train to Basingstoke.
