<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have created a new version of 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe 
that I believe does not have a first-move-win solution!&nbsp; I need help with 
solving this game if it actually can be.&nbsp; I would be willing to at least 
give&nbsp;you a free&nbsp;copy if you want to help.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The test marketing name of the game has been 
"Pentagonal" and it has been a success selling about 2000 in two years at about 
$30 (a bit&nbsp;much, but still worth it).&nbsp; The patent for it has been 
bought (the construction mechanism has been patented, the game was invented in 
1941) and is being tooled for mass production under another name which is not 
finalized yet.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This version is a significant improvement compared 
to the older versions of "Checkline", "Qubic" and others.&nbsp; It seems 
(correct me if I wrong) that all previous versions have been a 4x4x4 
matrix.&nbsp; I have played this arrangement many times and found it to not be a 
sufficient challenge, especially against an 'average-thinker'.&nbsp; Even if you 
know the secret (get an 'L' on any plane, and the game is over)&nbsp;and play 
against a real strategist,&nbsp;the&nbsp;2nd player has to constantly follow the 
first player in order to make this a game.&nbsp; The same goes for GO and other 
x-in-a-row strategy games.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>By increasing the number of levels to five, the 
game takes on a completely new dimension.&nbsp; Now the game an a center focus 
point, that becomes the key to the game.&nbsp; The addition I have added to the 
game is to make this center space a 'free-space', much like bingo ended up 
doing.&nbsp; This seemingly minor variation on the game may have created a close 
to mathmatical perfect game?&nbsp; What I need is someone who knows how to use 
the </FONT><A href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~victor/PhDthesis/chap2.ps.Z"><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>proof-number search </FONT></A><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>&nbsp;or&nbsp; </FONT><A 
href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~victor/PhDthesis/chap3.ps.Z"><FONT face=Arial 
size=2>dependency-based search </FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;to 
determine if there is a first-player-to-move-force-win sequence.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I do not believe there is a first-move-win with 
this variation, since&nbsp;in effect both players are making the first move, and 
since neither can win outright without&nbsp;exclusive control of the 
center.&nbsp; The game becomes a battle for the other critical 
strategy&nbsp;spaces, and&nbsp;a lot of the action is performed on the 
OUTSIDE&nbsp;spaces of the cube, instead of on the inside like a&nbsp;4x4x4 
version.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Plus I've designed it so you don't have to put 
anything together, and added a turntable&nbsp;for rotating the entire 
structure&nbsp;and get 360 degree viewing of the&nbsp;different angles.&nbsp; 
The use of marbles is also a big improvement over the&nbsp;use of checkers, 
because they appear almost as molecules suspended in space.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The game can be viewed at these sites (sorry 
they're pretty sold out):</FONT></DIV>
