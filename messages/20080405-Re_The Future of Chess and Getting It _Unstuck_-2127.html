The only thing I MAY of accused you of is being a FIDE purist, who
considers any changes to FIDE chess rules wrong, not needed, or more
strongly, "heresy" (ok, someone isn't going to use the actual word
"heresy", but by all practical terms, that is what they consider it).

You called me a heretic to my face. "And my comments about considering
a change in the chess rules is considered heresy by you."  You might
want to make a note when you insult someone so you will know why they
are so pissed off at you.

If anything I called you a FIDE purist, who considers the
contemplation of any changes heresy.  I would be the heretic for
considering this, not you. I am the one who will get burned at the
stake for contemplating and suggesting such be given thought, not
you.  I don't see where I ever called you a heretic.  If I had, I am
sorry.  Now, would you rather I NOT call you a FIDE purist, and state
that you do believe that considering changes in the way chess is, is
NOT heresy?  If that is what you want, that is fine then.  Then the
FIDE purist who considers chess as it is now immutable perfection,
wouldn't be a shoe for yourself.

After all this, if you are still offended here, then may I suggest you
ARE a FIDE purist who does consider changes to FIDE rules heresy.
Now, if you aren't that, then the shoe described doesn't fit you.  I
will say, in no way, shape or form do I consider you a heretic.
