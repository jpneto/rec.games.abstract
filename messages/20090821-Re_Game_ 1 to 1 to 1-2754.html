I think it might make some sense to have a rule change that players
use only odd integers. (1 then 3 then 5 then 7 then 9, etc.) Otherwise
it might be too easy to play defense by players laying down walls of
even numbers around their 1's.  (I know that he/she could not return
to his/her own 1, in that case. But too many games would end by all
players but one forfeiting, instead of by a player visiting all of the
1's, if the rules were that players are to write even integers on
even- numbered moves. In that case, the name of this game wouldn't be
very appropriate.)

It woul dnot be a good strategy to wall in your own 1, but once you have
placed a number in another player's 1, you could wall it in to prevent
all other players from reaching it.  But if they do the same, it will
definitely end in a stalemate.

A way to avoid this is by allowing players to place any number higher
than their previously played number.  This means that you can always
play in any square, but you might have to play a high number to do so.
You would have to change the winning criteria so it is not the first
player to reach all ones that wins, but the player who does so with the
smallest number.  When a player finishes, play continues until all
players play a number higher than the smallest finishing number.

A variant is to require the sum of numbers in a square to be a prime
instead of requiring the numbers to be coprime.
