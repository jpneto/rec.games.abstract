I've been into chess off and on all my life, and right now I'm on an up
cycle.  Lately I've also gotten interested in checkers (draughts),
another recurrent interest.  But I have a thing about doing things in
threes--so I'm wondering what other game would naturally complete this
set.  If I were going to focus on just three abstract (perfect
information, randomizer-free) board games, which game would go best
with chess and checkers?

Nine-mens Morris is a good choice, as you often find it on the back of
Checker-boards (at least in Europe).

You could also look at Halma or Chinese Checkers (which is neither
Chinese nor very much like Checkers).  Halma can be played on a normal
Chess/Checkers board, though it was originally designed for a 16x16
board.  These are both classic in the sense of being designed before
1900, and neither uses randomization.
