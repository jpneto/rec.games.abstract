But it's more than that. In Go, sensible play never leads to filling
your own eyes, but, in Goncrete, sensible play (I mean, without
cooperation between the players) can well lead to a full board
capture, especially in 9x9 games between differently skilled players,
where the weaker player may be unable to create a single alive group.

Yes, reflecting on it I can see that I tended too much towards the
idea that the removal mechanism provided a 'life insurance'.

Er... In fact, I think I must correct myself. I said that sensible
play "can well lead to a full board capture", but it should be, in
fact, an extremely rare occurrence, because it would require that the
leading player didn't have any eyes before capturing, which is hard to
imagine. Maybe in 4x4 games... or 3x3... or...

Anyway, it's good to have it covered in the rules.
