I've thought some about heuristics for Abalone. I would start with:

  1) Keep away from the edge/toward center
  2) Stay in large groups
  3) Optimize the number of your oponents marbles you can push around
     or off

And see how it goes. My first pass would try to min/max a hueristic
based on these rules and their reverses (for the opponent).

One serious problem is that Abalone assumess the players want to win
and doesn't have a ko rule. This makes a strong defense very hard to
beat. You would need to judge how aggressive to make the computer
player.
