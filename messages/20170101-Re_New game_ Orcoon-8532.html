You wrote I quote :
I've designed Paper and Pencil Go, Quaxtep, Yodd, Xodd, Ayu, Hyper, Loose, Konobi, Quentin, Brique, Vimbre, Kopano, Trisq, Sligo, Stoical Go, Alpha, Veletas, Whirlwind, Squer, Rhode, Cation, Morpheus, Lear, Flicker, Carteso, Rumbo and Linage.

Which one is not crappy game?
All are not only crappy games but above all plagiarized games.
And you dare because I was banished from bgg forum abstract to tell that vertical vs horizontal was not invented by me. By referring to Hex game.
Either you are dumb either you are of bad faith.
I invented the concept of capturing differently : one player can capture only vertically and his opponent vertically. Why is it interesting to break the capture in two? I let you answer to this question. We can use other dimensions (up-down, orthogonal-diagonal or any other binary dimension.
In Hex game there is no capture at all.
In many games one player can move in one direction and the other on the opposite etc... 
You are just trying to hide the fact that you plagiarized my idea.
It is not surprising that you waited so long to say that Hex game is similar to my idea.
I know all the tricks of the thieves and the "atajo de ladrones".

You have both you and Corey only one neuron.
History will show you are fake game designers.
History will that Hazen is the best game designer of this century.

Corey is so dumb that he can not get the flaw I pointed out to.
He has no idea that his game Meanderthal (I called it like this and he never mentioned that I was the inventor of the name) is EASILY SOLVABLE. Almost like tic tac toe.
