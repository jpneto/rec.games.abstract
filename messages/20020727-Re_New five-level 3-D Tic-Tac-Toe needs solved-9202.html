... [One thing] I like about your game is that you've made x effective halfway

diagonal and center planes even harder to win on then if they were even, but
the other planes remain odd.

I didn't understand 'free space' to mean 'off limits'.  I thought he meant
that it belonged to both players.  My understanding of Bingo is that the
center space is 'free', and you can complete a five-in-a-row through it by
marking just the other four in that row.
