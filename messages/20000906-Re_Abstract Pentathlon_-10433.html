Heh heh! I'll double right back then!  :-)  I play backgammon with my sister
fairly often, and she's an all-out runner and conservative point maker, but
never tries for primes. I run (even from the one point) if I get any double
early (say, within three turns). At other times I've been known to build a side
prime as far out as my opponent's outer table.  :-P  But I prefer hitting blots
to covering isolated points because it's the surest way to force my opponent to
roll and roll and roll. I win more multi-games, but if she effectively covers
her points and stays off the bar, my sister wins (almost always single games)
more often. I'm not sure whether it all evens out in the end.

What tradeoff do you want between showing intermediate ability in

I just thought that the spirit of a pentathlon is to show overall strength and
well-roundedness as an abstract gamer. In the Olympics, the winner of the
decathlon probably didn't win each individual event as well. Likewise, the
winners of the individual events may not have done so well in events at which
they were not as good. For example, marathon runners are usually not the best
at shot put. Likewise, a chess master may lose at renju.
