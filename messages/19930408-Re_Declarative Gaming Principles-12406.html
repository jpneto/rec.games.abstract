Hi folks,

has anyone ever thought of leaving the world of procedural gaming and maybe
design a game, which is of a declarative nature?

If you don't know, what I mean by declarative in respect to gaming, don't
worry, I am still struggling to grasp this wholly new concept, too. After
thinking about it for a week or so, I do have some idea of what a declarative
game could look like and what kinds of things the players could do, which
they couldn't in today's procedural games.

I'm not sure what you mean by declative gaming for certain, but you may
be surprised to find out that this may not the "wholly new" concept you
took it for.  To wit: the Nomic games.

Nomic is a game where a very small set of rules is given to start, and
most are "mutable" --- the players can then work to alter the rules and
make up their own within the granted stucture (including the alteration
of that stucture itself).
There are other, related games (such as Senate), but Nomic has the
largest following in the net (it even has Nomic World, a telnet based
server for the game)

Is this the sort of thing you meant?

Mel

Hint to Nomic fans: this is a great excuse for one of you to post the
rules to Nomic and an adress for Nomic World.
