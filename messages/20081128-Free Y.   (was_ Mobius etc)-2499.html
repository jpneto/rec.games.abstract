Mark Steere makes several important points:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the popularity of a game is the least important aspect to me.
The design as something to behold has always been my focus.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

For me, the focus is to have good games with as "simple" and
"canonical" rules as possible.  The ideal is to have a game
with very simple rules, but complex and deep strategies.
Go is the classic case, but Hex and Y are more modern ones.

geometric games.  The "golden eggs" ... are these hexagonally
tessellated, equal goals games in which a filled board produces
exactly one winner.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I agree.  And if the goals for the two players are not merely
isomorphic, but actually <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>identical<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, as in Y, that is a big plus.
Not a necessary one though, OC. But (as Mark says), as I term them,
equi-tasking &amp; win-loss complementarity are vital elements.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I don't care if these games ever get played.  They have a value
way beyond playability and popularity to me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Absolutely.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
These games... aren't designed.  They're discovered.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Absolutely.  Joao Neto and I, who design and play a large number
of these, always use that terminology.  Whether or not one takes
a Platonic view of their abstract existence, it is a good measure
to encourage modesty, as well.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I just swept up a bunch of these golden eggs and put them in
a basket.  There isn't anything major left to be discovered now
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Where's that modesty!?  ;-)   That's a dangerous assumption!
There may well be a lot left to discover.

As an example, you haven't even mentioned "Free Y", which I've
posted on this newsgroup before.  IMHO this may turn out to be
the MOST CANONICAL of all the planar connection games.
..........

It is very simple - a hexagonal board, with an odd total number
of boundary cells, sides &lt;6,7,6,7,6,7&gt;, and the like, are best;
i.e. almost-regular hexagons.

The rules are simple - standard connection-game rules,
with the goal for both player being to make a group that:

(a) touches two nearly-opposite border cells; OR

(b) touches three border cells such that the shortest
    border-distance between any pair is less than
    half the circumference.

(In fact, suitably interpreted, rule "a" is just a special
 case (!) of rule "b", but it's better to list them both.)

This highly canonical game is a natural end point of the search
to play Y, not on a triangle, but any other shape of board.
To keep it like Y, one is first tempted to mark out three
side segements of equal length, and play Y on that.
But eventually one realises that it isn't necessary to have
fixed end-points to the three segments - hence "Free Y".

IMHO this is the most natural locally-hex connection game for
planar play. It is also less likely to succumb to over-analysis
of special tactics for near-corner play and so forth.

The ULTIMATE hex-connection game, with THE most canonical goal,
is (IMHO) Projex:-  played on a projective plane, with goal merely
to make a global loop.  The board has NO corners OR edges!
However, most folk (apart from mathies) don't like playing on
non-planar topology boards.  Hence...

- just a bunch of quirky projective plane games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

....this comment is fairly well justified, sadly.
