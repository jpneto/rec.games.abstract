Hi Mike!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
1) I understand that there should be some more info re results on the MSO
website shortly.
2) Tournaments generally ran as scheduled
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Excellent!

3) Some games organisations have got the results of events relating to those
particular games held at MSO up (Pacru/Shacru/Azacru results are on the
competitions page on the Pacru website plus reports on Boardgamegeek)
4) I'm pretty sure that David M Pearce won the "Pentamind" followed by Alain
Dekker
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ah yes we played a game of Twixt in 2005. Did he win the Twixt event?

6) Whatsisface did abscond with the money (again!) but you will be glad to
hear
7) MSO are already planning a Central London Event for August 2008
8) Venue and future were discussed at the meeting with participants keen to
see a return to a more central venue.  The continuing issues (in the view of
many) are enough funding and organisation to get a good venue and market it
the event successfully.   The event currently relies on a good deal of
voluntary labour and good will.

It seems to me that another issue is current management.

Thanks for the update!
