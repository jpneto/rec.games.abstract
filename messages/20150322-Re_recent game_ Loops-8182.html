Thinking about your game :)  By the way, I'm not trying to cut in on it.  I'm only evaluating an obvious variation - one that you've undoubtedly considered.  Look at the Begird rule sheet, in particular diagram 3c.  

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Begird_rules.pdf</a>

Begird is generalized Y.  When the number of "islands" is 3, Begird is equivalent to Y.  In diagram 3c, each island is the minimal size of one cell.

If "Loops F" allowed filled-in loops, and a loop were defined (partly) by the number of perimeter cells it spans, from 2 to half the total number, and if a loop owned all of the loops within it, you'd have something <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>related<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to Begird.  The boards in Begird have to be odd shaped to prevent draws created when each player owns half of the perimeter.  But in Loops, which incorporates a loop's size (number of stones comprising it and its captured area) into its value, you can use an ordinary hex hex board, because the size component of the loop's value precludes equal scores.  

If you prescribed somehow, by using "less than or equal to" language or maybe just expressly, that if two opposing loops each span half of the perimeter, the larger of the two loops (including captured area) out-ranks the other one, and the winner owns the entire board.
