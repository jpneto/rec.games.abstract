What's all this shit about "standing"?  The last guy who was hung up on standing was Bill Taylor, and he flushed out like a fat turd.  If standing is a measure of design accomplishment and masterful debating, I've got standing up the ying-yang.  If standing is a measure of popularity or grudging admiration from jealous colleagues, then no.  Either way, I really don't give a fuck about "standing".

I come here to discuss abstract games and, perhaps to a larger degree, to goof on anyone who acts retarded.  That would Christian Freeling with his outlandish claims, as well you Corey, a genuine retard.  Lately, you're making my job a lot easier.

It's a small group, yes.  So what?  I don't need 500 bgg me-tooers flagging my posts for TOS violations.  

Careful, Corey.  I've got my hand on the flusher....
