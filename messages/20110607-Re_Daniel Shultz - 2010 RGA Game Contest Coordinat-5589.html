Got all the votes in!  Results are well... i'd prefer the term ironic
I suppose, but tragic came to mind :P
There is no 1st - 3rd.  Everyone scored exactly the same.

In the second and last part of the judging (this phase) the jury
person listed the 3 games determined in the 1st phase in the order
that they liked the games.  For every 1st place ranking that game
scores 5 points, 2nd 3 points, and 3rd 1 point.  Unfortunately in this
case they all add up to the same number.  I suppose if you just take
everyone's first place ranking then Mixtour and Splay would tie for
1st.  Coincidentally if you take everyone's last place ranking then
it's also Mixtour and Splay.  It's a perfect draw it seems.

Jury:
A: MKS
B: SKM
C: MKS
D: SMK
E: KSM

This means that:

M: 5+5+3+1+1  = 15
K: 5+3+3+3+1  = 15
S: 5+5+3+1+1  = 15

....I wonder how many draw situations are possible using this system.
Or rather what the ratio is between draw and non-draw outcomes.
hmmm...

Anyway.  Congrats to you all.  I was surprised to have enjoyed a
majority of the games in such a small contest.

Bring out the belly dancers.  The contest is over!

Daniel
btw... my personal favorite was/is Grabber
