It seems like the person who adds the last number to the initial list has a
lot of control, and should probably be able to win. He gets to make the last
free choice, after which the moves are much more limited.

But if you randomize who moves first in the second phase, that advantage
mostly disappears. The person who goes last in the first phase theoretically
still decides whether the initial position is winnable, but since he doesn't
know who will go first, he might as well try to make it interesting.

Players then take turns; on each turn a player rewrites the list with
one of these changes:
Either:
The player changes one integer in the list to a product of any number
of PROPER divisors, each divisor greater than 1, that all multiply to
that integer. (The divisors must be placed between the same integers
in the list as the integer they replaced, but they can be in any order
amongst themselves between those integers.)
Or:
The player replaces two adjacent integers in the list with their sum.
(The sum goes in the same location within the list as the two integers
it replaces.)

The first player to get a list completely of primes is the winner.

In your example you have allowed a 1 in the initial list. It's not clear
whether you'd consider 1 to be a prime for purposes of game termination. I
think you should... the idea that you can get a list of just primes and 1's
and still make an addition move feels wrong. (Note: a 1 will never appear in
the list except if it was there from the beginning).

If a large predetermined number of moves have taken place, and no one

Unnecessary; just make repetition a draw. (This was covered already elsewhere
in the thread.)

Example:

I wrote a program to determine optimal play in the second phase for 2
players, with my preferred interpretations (1 is prime for termination
purposes, and draws only occur by repeating a position). It turns out that
your example players made a lot of mistakes.

List to start:
2, 4, 10, 4, 1, 10
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The list construction was perfect, assuming that player 2 put the 10 on the
end. He gave player 1 a list that allows 11 legal moves, all of which lose.

P1:
2, 4, 2, 5, 4, 1, 10
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Player 1 had no good moves available, so this was acceptable. If he'd gone to
"6 10 4 1 10" he would have put player 2 in a more challenging situation,
with 2 winning moves, 1 drawing move, and 8 losing moves. By doing
"2 4 2 5 4 1 10" he's given player 2 an easier position, with 3 winning
moves, 1 drawing move, and 6 losing moves.

P2:
2, 4, 2, 5, 5, 10

Player 2 made a mistake here, which gives player 1 a chance to win. Correct
move was "2 2 2 2 5 4 1 10" or "2 4 2 5 2 2 1 10" or "2 4 2 5 4 11"

Player 1 is doing great! He picked the only winning move. The other 7 moves
all lose.

P2:

Any move would lose, but player 2 did a good job here anyway, picking the
only move that left player 1 with just a single winning move (and no drawing
moves) in response.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
P1:
2, 6, 20

And player 1 makes his first mistake. "8 5 15" would have forced a win. Now
he's given player 2 another chance. But there are 11 moves and 10 of them
lose. Will player 2 find the correct response?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
P2:
8, 20
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, that wasn't it. Player 2 should have said "2 6 2 10". But player 1 still
doesn't have an easy job. There are 11 legal moves again, and again 10 of the
lose. (At this point the end is close enough that at least some of the losing
moves should be obvious.)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
P1:
8, 4, 5
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Player 1 missed the win again. "8 10 2" would have done it. Player 2 gets
another shot at winning. This time there are 6 legal moves, and 4 of them are
obvious losers. Of the other 2, only one will guarantee a win. (Figure it
out, it's getting easy now.)

That definitely wasn't it.

Player 1 wins.

Finally.

There might be real potential for strategy in this game, but first you'd have
to learn the endgame patterns.
