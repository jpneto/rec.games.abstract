Someone left a wigged out message in the Game Site X chat about being a potato, and then not really being a potato, having dirty fingernails, etc.  As a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>joke<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, I said that Christian came unglued.

You're on my mind because of the humongous thread you've created in the Arimaa forum, dwarfing the whole rest of the forum - 63 pages of you licking your own nut sack.  I've never met anyone, in any field of endeavor, so enamored with the flavor of their own scrotum.

But I get views :) The 34.000+ at the moment came after Omar had reset the number at 108.000, possibly because of the six character digit.

Blah, blah, blah, you said it. There's a committee organizing the Havannah Challenge, coming fall. Is that so strange? (I'm not in it, by the way)

You're not that important, Christian.  You've got a couple of good games.  Corey Clark has a couple of good games.  Nick Bentley has a couple of good games.  I have a couple of good games.  Welcome to the club, Christian.  Nothing in your portfolio elevates you above the rest of the pack.  All of your profound "significance" exists solely in your mind.

Refreshing point of view, almost an attack of sanity. Now to elaborate on this, in the mindsports homepage it says: "Life is fundamentally futile and great games are a tribute to precisely that" - futility is the context Mark, we're embedded in it (hope it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable). As to the significance of games, in the ArenA it says: "If abstract games matter at all, these eight matter".

"If abstract games matter at all", Mark. It depends on one's point of view, it's all relative. Of course you don't know what 'relative' is, that's why you're so funny :) .
