Tinsley's search algorithm is more efficient, resulting in an effective
processing speed which greatly surpasses Chinook's in certain positions.
Other positions favour Chinook's abilities, so it is a contest to see
who can obtain those positions which best suit their styles, just as in
any contest between humans.  I give Tinsley an edge here.

Just exactly how would one measure Tinsley's processing speed in these
different types of positions?  I think that your claims are stated 
in an overly scientific manner.  Clearly, if the game of checkers
can be divided into two parts, A (opening + middlegame) and B (endgame),
and Chinook plays B positions perfectly yet still manages to lose
to Tinsley in a match, then Tinsley is better in type A positions.
This certainly is not a deep observation.  I'm just not certain what 
effective processing power means, or to say that his search algorithm 
is more efficient.

Endurance and fatigue?  In the first Tinsley - Chinook match, the only
game that was clearly determined by physical weakness was Chinook's
forfeit in game 18 -- the turning point of the match for Tinsley, who
trailed 2-0 at the time.  Tinsley did have some trouble with the tight
schedule, but it is not clear that that contributed to either of his
losses.  With the increasing complexity of the Silicon Graphics hardware
used for these matches, it is not at all unreasonable to assume that
Chinook's risk of mechanical failure is greater than Tinsley's.

It would be interesting to see if the performance of Chinook was better
in the second and third games played in a day, as opposed to the first games.
Presumably, Tinsley would be sharpest for the first game, and would fall
off after that.  Checkers match conditions sound as if they were intended
for competition between 2 humans, with the assumption that fatigue will
affect both of them equally.  Maybe even two games in one day is an unfair
advantage for a computer, and a statiscal analysis of previous matches may 
shed some light on this.
