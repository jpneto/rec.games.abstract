Freeling, can you have any shred of affinity for you protege

He's not my protege and I'm not his keeper. I do think these actions
are superfuous though. If your collegues follow these threads they can
see for themselves how offensive your language can be and how low your
attacks. If you call Oust an "easy to design piece of shit" you
obviously can't distinguish between a game and its inventor. Not that
I hadn't noticed that before. You just want to be an admired member of
a group - any group. Your qualities as an inventor border on zero.

So I don't care all that much.
