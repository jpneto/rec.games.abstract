Yes, it is indeed a wise decision starting at a simple stage first and
develop skills and experience as one climbs up to the advanced stage.

The question is, why choose Tic Tac Toe?

The reason is that creating a Tic Tac Toe video game is extremely
simple such that creating the gameplay and rules are at a kindergarden
stage, however, it provides a great challenge when it comes to creating
the player and AI interaction within the game (player vs. computer).

This sort of challenge will assist when it comes to creating an AI in a
further game, which I am sure it will be needed.

My original intent was to produce a game very similar to Tic Tac Toe
with a little difference to the rules and the way in which the game is
played, however, a Tic Tac Toe game was created first, for may reasons,
which will then be followed by the intended game.

I would like to ask if you can give a few games you think is the best
to be made into a video game. A game that takes strategy and is
complex, but simple to catch on.

After Tic Tac Toe Plus, I will create more games with the help of
people like you who can put useful inputs to help in developing the
game for the best.
