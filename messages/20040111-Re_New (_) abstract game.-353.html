I've discovered the first player can win on 6x5 by playing on a point
one below a corner. Vertical must play into the corner, then
horizontal can play a long sweeping move into the other corner. This
makes the remaining rectangle longer and thinner in horizontal's
favour, and this is sufficient to win on 6x5. This is a good opening
move for horizontal on any board size, and is a bit of a flaw. Also,
I've noticed the most interesting positions occur when the opening
moves(s) don't touch the board edge. So, a slight rule modification:
the start point must be an internal one (not an edge point).

Here's the full rules again. 
Play on a rectangular grid of dots. The first player  highlights any
internal dot (i.e. not an edge dot) by drawing a small circle around
it. The second player draws a vertical line from this dot of any
length. The first player then extends the line with a horizontal
segment, again of any length, and so on horiz, vertical, horiz etc.
The snake so formed may not cross or touch itself.
At any time instead of moving a player may challenge their opponent to
complete the snake such that it passes through all the dots. If the
opponent demonstrates this can be done then the challenger loses, if
the opponent can't then the challenger wins. The player who makes the
last move wins.
