Rive is tactical as opposed tp strategical because there are no
"caclulable signposts along the way": everything is changeable. It
grows at a monks pace, but it grows, so it is finite. The number of
cells is odd, so someone will win.
Obviously, because of these characteristics, it will fit only small
boards. Being at a loss about the reason for winning or losing it
comes with the territory. Play on small boards should eventually
unveil strategy (tactical games <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> have strategy of course).

My first issue with it was the rules, so I wrote in another thread:
____________________
Mark, wouldn't it be better to rephrase this rule:
"A stone must be placed so that the largest group it connects to is
minimal. If you can place a stone in isolation, you must do so."
 to:
"If possible a stone must be placed in isolation, otherwise it may
only contact the smallest group (or groups if more groups are
minimal)."
?____________________

Then I saw a problem:
____________________
"Oops, I see a problem there - it is possible to have a group size 'n'
that is surrounded by larger groups, so that it is impossible to
place next to the 'n' group without connecting to an 'n+' group."
?____________________

This problem is not related to the suggested rephrasing. It's right
here:

White to move, or black for that matter. No isolated placement is
possible, so the player to move must connect to the 1-group at C1, but
in doing so he also connects to a 2-group.

So what's the legal move here?
