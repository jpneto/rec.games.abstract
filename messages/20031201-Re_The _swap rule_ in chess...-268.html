<div class="moz-text-flowed">Agree that on-line and OTB tourneys should find you players appropriate 
to your playing level.&nbsp; In fact, "Swiss" style tourneys are set up such 
that if you win, you'll get a higher rated opponenet &amp; if you lose, a 
lower rated.&nbsp; The idea is that you'll eventually be paired against 
someone about your playing level.

<br>Sounds like a problem with those players, not the game...

<br>Same thing I've said about many other games with "problems".
<br>
<br>I think it's always just a matter of taste, but to me Chess is far
<br>from perfect.&nbsp; The biggest problem I have with Chess is the opponent
<br>factor; it is so difficult to find a player who is better than you are
<br>while remaining challenged by your play.&nbsp; For me the game is only
<br>interesting when it isn't an open and shut case from the opener.
<br>
<br>You can probably tell I don't often play.
