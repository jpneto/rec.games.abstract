I would like to announce the arrival of a new connection game.
It is recently implemented on Richard Rognlie's pbem server,
where it has already attracted several fans.

Quadrex is another attempt to construct a Hex-like game
played on a checkers-style board.  It is a close relative to Quax,
already on the server, but has a different method of resolving
potential impasses, which does not require Quax's "extra pieces",
that is, the diagonal connections of Quax.

The strategy is in many ways similar to Quax, but it is
a faster-moving and wider-sweeping game, which,
as we have found by substantial testing, needs a much bigger
board to allow the full strategic potentiality to take effect.
In fact, it seems to turn out that the best board size is 19x19;
which means the game can be played with a standard Go set!
So we have made 19x19 the default size.  We wondered if this
figure, 19x19, is a higher constant, like G, c, h, pi and e !   :)
(Bahai'ists take note.)
____

The key feature of the new game, QUADREX, is that whenever a potential
impasse forms, (that is, a smallest square       o x
with some reflection or rotation of this.....         x .
or its color-opposite), then the fourth cell
is IMMEDIATELY filled with the majority color,   o x
producing the following situation:-                     x x  &lt;--- fill-
in stone

This filling-in is part of the move that created the 3/4 situation,
and is automatically filled in by the server.   If the filling-in
results in another small square of the same type, then that is
filled in too, and so on.  Note that a fill-in may result from
EITHER a move by the local majority player, OR by the other player,
though naturally the former is far more common.

Please note that this type of 3/4-cells....      x x
does NOT result in any change or fill-in.     o .
With impasses automatically resolved by
this procedure, ties are impossible, as in Hex.    As always
in connection games, the first move is a considerable advantage,
so there is as usual a swap option after the first stone is placed.
____

We earnestly enjoin all connection-game fans to try this new
and exciting variant.

Thanks for reading!

Bill Taylor
