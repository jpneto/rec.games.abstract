Hello Everyone,

Chebache is a new abstract strategy board game which is now
available as an Online version with a FREE download at:
                     <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.chebache.com">www.chebache.com</a>  

Chebache unites elements of Checkers, Backgammon and Chess and many 
unique modes of play. It was designed to fill the gap between 
Backgammon and Chess in regards to the balance of strategy and chance.
There are more options of movement and strategy than Backgammon, while 
still including the chance elements of dice.  
(Please read the excerpts from some of the reviews and comments about 
Chebache at the end of this message.)

The Online version of Chebache, which is up and running as a trial 
version is a FREE download, which will have occasional updates. 
The latest version is 2.3. 

*Note: Chebache Online will only run on PC (Windows) computers, for 
now. Sorry to all Mac users, we hope to have a Mac version ready 
sometime soon.

There are several tutorial aspects
included, which are explained in the "Help" section of the MENU, along
with the rules, notation and other features. Once online, please check
the message board for updates.

For the FREE download and general information about Chebache, 
including reviews from On and Offline magazines and comments from 
Chebache players, please take a moment to visit:

* The links for the download and the Chebache Egroups forum are in the
left margin of the home page, although we may move the link to a more
visible location soon.


We are hosting Chebache Online Gatherings Monday and Tuesday nights 
from 7-10pm EST, however, there is clearly a need to find another time
that would be more convenient for those of you across the ocean. If 
you have a feeling about a given time that would work well for you, 
please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate. You may 
play online at anytime, as long as you can find someone there to play.
So, for the time being, you will find it easier if you arrange to meet
someone in the "game room" at particular time. One way to do this 
would be to join Chebache egroups on yahoo.com where you can leave 
messages about when you are available to play. 

We would greatly appreciate your help in fine tuning Chebache Online. 
We believe that we have successfully fixed all the bugs, but, have 
not tested the server with a large number of people playing at once.  
If you should have any problems or would simply like to comment or 
ask a question about Chebache,  please don't hesitate to write us.

Excerpts from reviews and comments on Chebache:

"It has an elegent, extremely well conceived structure, providing the 
players with accessible but complex decisions.  Most important, It's 
teriffic fun, even exciting to play.  ...Chebache's magic lies in the 
ever changing game flow. ...It's this combination of fast movement, 
die rolling, and deep positional play that makes Chebache so 
entertaining. If you are looking for an exciting game built on 
familiar principles that has addictive quality and will also stretch 
your strategic faculties, ...I strongly recommend Chebache. 
I love this elegent game and I think you will too."   
      --Mitchell Thomashow, TheGamesJournal.com  

"...you'll appreciate it's fascinating nuances...you will also be 
amazed at how much originality, choice and action there is this tiny
arena."
      --John J. McCallion, GAMES Magazine

"Tactics are far more interesting than backgammon varied [than 
backgammon], and there are more interesting long term strategies.
Recommended"
      -- Frank Branham, Gamer's Alliance

"I found the appearance of Chebache to be immediately appealing... 
The effort is well woth the reward. This is an attractive and 
interesting game."   --Kerry Handscomb, Abstract Games Magazine

"...If you enjoy chess or backgammon, then you should get plenty of 
game play out of Chebache, and it would be well worth adding to your 
game collection. ...Highly Recommended (and then some).   
         --Todd Weaver, KODT Magazine (Knights of the Dinner Table)

"If you really like Backgammon, graduate to Chebache. Whenever a 
game designer combines several ideas from several games, I often 
find myself wishing that I was playing Chebache.  "Now, whenever 
I play Backgammon, I find myself wishing I was playing Chebache."
        --Jake Davenport, ContageousDreams.com

GENERAL PUBLIC

  "Just had to send you an email. I got my copy of Chebache yesterday 
and have yet only played one game. And that game has me hooked!"   
Very well done. I'm extremely impressed.  You've achieved a beautiful 
balance between many different elements, opening up all sorts of 
strategic plans. Yet at the same time created a game that is simple 
to play an simple to learn. Heck, I even really like the way it looks.
It's very visually appealing.  ...I'm going to highly recommend this 
game to everyone!   Thanks!"     --Evan Siegworth 11/18/2000  

  "You have a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>winner<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> here... Familiarity makes me appreciate its 
subtlety.  Chebache, I believe is truly a metaphor for life. Many 
lessons to be lessons   to be learned there."  --Thomas A. Gilchrist 

  Chebache is great! I learned at Gen-Con and have sucked my sister 
and parents in to this great game. Thanks!  --Karl Schultz  9/17/2000

  I bought Chebache for my wife for Christmas, and it made a great 
gift!  We both enjoyed playing it. Thanks for the fun new game.  
           --Craig Dailey 12/29/2000

  "We could tell right away that Chebache was [going to be] Great!   
...The more we play,  the better we grasp the implications of the  
various options, and we're enjoying the process of learning how to 
better incorporate them into strategic play.  ...One of the things 
I really like is that the entire board remains in play throughout 
the game. There's never a "table" or point that's out of contention.
...Chebache is truly a game of "It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over," and we 
love the adrenaline rush on both sides when one of us suddenly 
capitalizes on the dice/formations and redirects the flow of the game.
This game is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fun<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>!  
 - My 11 - yr old son played Chebache for the first time a couple of 
nights ago. Having watched his father and me go at it, he jumped right
in- ...As it  was, he beat me fairly handily.  
He's decided he really likes Chebache :-). 
         --Sarah Samuelson   5/22/2001

"Just checking in with some Chebache thoughts, as the game remains 
one of my husband's and my favorite head-to-head contests. ...Our 
family recently joined another for a week end away, providing the 
opportunity for my husband and me to play a best-of-three mini  
tournament with one another - three consecutive games within the 
span of a week end (somewhat of a luxury for us).  ...After our 
recent playings, I appreciate the Rush Factor all the more.  
...- that adrenaline surge resulting from suddenly being back in 
a game, from the instant momentum swings possible from mid-game on.  
It was also interesting introducing Chebache to our friends.  
Perhaps our zeal and obvious enjoyment piqued their interest? :-)"
       --Sarah Samuleson  11/9/001
