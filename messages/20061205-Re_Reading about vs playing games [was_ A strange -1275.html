Many people who likes Chess and Checkers tend to like Amazons :) and
there is a Zillions implementation. A nice game worth to try!

best wishes in your search!

Thanks.  I think I've played Amazons before--and it is a pretty good
game.

Funny, though--after starting this thread, I'm now having second
thoughts.  Why am I looking for three games when any one of them would
afford me plenty of challenge for life?

Some people might ask, "Why are you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>limiting<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> yourself to just three?
Why not play 'em all?"  The trouble is, I do.  I've always been a
dabbler at games, but I've always wanted to get good at one.

I figure the thing to do is first choose a game, then stick to it and
practice it--and read up on it if there's literature available.  So,
that's what I did.  I chose chess because there's lots of good software
and literature and I've always liked the game.

But the dilettante in me just won't sit still.  I soon remembered how
my dad used to always beat me at checkers when I was a kid, and how I
always wanted to get good at that game.  So I thought maybe I'd apply
myself to both chess and checkers.

Those games are a lot of work, though, so pretty soon I found myself
looking for a third game.  I think my interest in Nine Men's Morris has
really been just an attempted escape from the tough challenge of chess
and checkers.  But it's not working; NMM is a tough game too.

Typically at this point I get discouraged and turn to games with
randomizers--e.g., backgammon or cribbage.  They're more relaxing--but
less satisfying.

Now I'm thinking I ought to drop NMM, decide between chess and
checkers, and just focus on improving at one game.  I've apparently
bitten off more than I can chew.

The tough part at this point is deciding (that always seems to be a
weak point for me).  I've read a fair amount about chess over the
years, and I like the game.  But I learned checkers first and regret
never really getting the hang of it.  Of course, chess is the classier
game (and checkers seems to almost be headed for obsolescence), but
that need not concern me.  For me, it's just a matter of mental
exercise, discipline, and proving to myself that I can learn to play
reasonably well if I apply myself.

This online article makes a pretty good case for checkers:

So . . .  what to do?
