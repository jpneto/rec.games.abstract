Hey guys I hate to ruin your party but this discussion group
is rec.games.chess, that's right <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>chess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> NOT checkers. You've
wasted enough bandwidth already and I have better things to do
than edit my kill file. Could you please move this f*cking
thread elsewhere? Thank you.

Please understand that this is not a flame nor is it intended to be 
sarcastic. In fact a reasonable answer could even change my behavior.

Obviously putting a note about checkers on this conference seems to have 
upset you plenty, even though we've seen comparisons between chess and go 
on this conference. In times past people have compared chess playing 
computers with checker playing computers so there is some overlap...

Let me ask you, do you read every posting in this conference or do you look 
at the directory and pick out the stuff you want to read. If the latter, 
can't you just hit the down arrow past the checkers stuff? 

Or, on the other hand is this a question of principle... that Chess 
conferences should be for chess only, just on principle... no intermixing 
of conferences... is that your thinking? I believe this is something upon 
which reasonable men may disagree... 

Or is it something else. Again, I just want to know what bugs you so much 
about a checkers post on the chess conference...
