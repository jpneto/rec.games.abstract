The other question regards Sprouts, which was very popular in
math departments in the sixties, and was featured in the 
book Macroscope.  In those days it was known that the second player 
won the six point straight game, but the seven point was unknown.
So were the misere (last player loses) six point games.  Does
anybody know if those are solved?  Also, has anybody deviced an
easy notation for e-mail play?  Since it required drawing curves
it is not easy to record other than by sending a sheet of paper
back and forth.

I must sound like I'm Rip Van Winkle waking up.  When in the academic
world we used to discuss all these games, but I left it years ago, 
and have not thought much about them since.

There's an interesting discussion of Sprouts going on in the newsgroup
comp.programming.  Conway &amp; Patterson's game of Sprouts is explained in E.R.
Berlekamp, J.H. Conway and R.K.Guy's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, Academic Press, London,
1982.

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kwhyte@math.uchicago.edu">kwhyte@math.uchicago.edu</a> (Kevin Whyte) began the discussion with this
description of the game

	First, let me describe the game of sprouts.  It is a 
	pencil and paper game.  The game starts with some # of dots
	on the board.  A legal move is to draw a line connecting 2
	dots, and to add a dot somewhere on the line (connecting
	a dot to itself is acceptable); subject to the following
	restrictions: 1&gt; No dot can lie on more than three lines
        (so , each dot starts w/ 3 "lives".  Drawing
	a line uses one life of each of the dots - 2 if the dot
	is connected to itself.  The dot added on the line has only
	one life left.)
                      2&gt; No lines may cross.

	If it is your turn to move, and you have no legal move, you
	lose.  My question is how to do this by computer.  First, how
	do you even write a program to allow people to play each other,
	with the program only keeping track of the board and the legality
	of the moves?  Secondly, if you wanted to make the computer actually
	play the game, can anyone think of a way to recognize equivalent
	moves (of which there usually are many), so as to have a search
	be reasonable?

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:rockwell@socrates.umd.edu">rockwell@socrates.umd.edu</a> (Raul Deluth Miller-Rockwell) considered a data
structure to deal with the state of the game:

	Ok, obviously you need a data structure for each dot which can
	record connections with up to three other dots.  So the trick
	is dealing with intersecting lines.

and went on to discuss this topological problem and related questions as
the game is played.  He also speculated on how Sprouts is related to Nim.


<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pdh@netcom.com">pdh@netcom.com</a> (Phil Howard KA9WGN / I am the NRA) continued this discussion
with <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:rockwell@socrates.umd.edu">rockwell@socrates.umd.edu</a> (Raul Deluth Miller-Rockwell) in later articles
fleshing out the details.


<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:sleator+@CS.CMU.EDU">sleator+@CS.CMU.EDU</a> (Daniel Sleator) wrote

	David Applegate, Guy Jacobson and I wrote a program to analyze
	sprouts, and we also wrote a tech report about it.  (CMU-CS-91-144,
	and It's available via anonymous ftp.  See the end of this
	message for instructions on how to get it.)  We used a number
	of sophisticated techniques -- both mathematical and programming.
	It's an interesting and fun problem.  I recommend this
	well-written paper to all.  (We haven't found a good place to
	publish it.  Any suggestions?)

	Last fall, several students in my algorithms class implemented a user
	interface that runs under X.  It worked quite well, but they never
	connected a program that plays the game with the interface.  It was
	just a substitute for pencil and paper.  Perhaps they'll have
	something to say on the subject.

	Here is a table that summarizes the results of our program.

	Number of spots   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	normal play       L   L   W   W   W   L   L*  L*  W*  W*   W*   
	misere  play      W   L   L   L   W*  W*  L*  L*  L*

	W denotes that the game is a win for the first player;  
	L denotes a loss for the first player.  
	A "*" indicates new results obtained by our program.

	In misere play, the player who cannot move wins.  (In contrast to
	normal play, where the the player who cannot move loses.)

	Sprouts Conjecture: The first player has a win in the initial
	configuration of normal sprouts iff the number of spots is 3,4,
	or 5  modulo 6.

	An analogous conjecture can be made for misere play (0 or 1 modulo 5).

	I believe these conjectures, Applegate does not.  He thinks that
	they're just another manifestation of the "strong law of small
	numbers", in other words, that the pattern is just random.  Yeah,
	right.

	Anyway, we have a large bet riding on the outcome of the 10 spot
	misere game.  We haven't been able to resolve it, because
	computational resources that seem to be required are beyone what is
	available to us.  (The Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center turned down
	our request for Cray time to run our program.  Sick.)

	The internet host is spade.pc.cs.cmu.edu, 128.2.209.226, and the file
	you want is /usr/sleator/public/sprouts.ps.Z.  CMU's ftp is a little
	strange, so here is a transcript.  (By the way, while you're looking
	around here, you might check out the English parser I wrote.)

I first read about Sprouts in the Piers Anthony book <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Macroscope<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.
According to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (1), it was invented by M.S. Patterson and
J.H. Conway (who also invented "life").

For those who don't know, the rules of sprouts are:
1. Start with some number n of dots on a sheet of paper.
2. Players take turns. On your turn, draw a line from one dot
   to another dot (or the same dot) without intersecting any lines
   (including itself), and put a new dot in the middle of the line.
3. There can be at most 3 lines coming out of a dot.  Initially
   there are 3n places to put lines, and each new line eliminates
   2 and adds 1 new place.  So the game can last at most 3n-1 turns.
   Usually less because there might be a place that you can't get
   to without intersecting lines.
4. The first player who has no legal moves loses (or wins--that
   version is interesting too).  I forget which is Anthony's version.

<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> says a few things about strategies, but not much.  I
bet a computer player could beat most humans easily by doing a
brute-force search.  It would be fun to write an X program that could
play the game.

For reference, here are the outcomes of some initial positions with
optimal play.  The numbers are how many moves it takes to win the
game, N means the first player wins, and P means the second player
wins.  According to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, nobody knows who wins for any
n greater than 6.

				Value of n (# spots)

		0	1	2	3	4	5	6
		---	---	---	---	---	---	---
no moves=lose:	0P	2P	4P	7N	9N	11N	14P
no moves=win:	0N	2N	5P	7P	9P

Applegate, Jacobson, and Sleator reveal the results found by their program

I'm glad you asked that question.  (At the end of this message is a
definition of the game, in case you're not familiar with it).  I'm
only aware of one paper on the subject since the publication of
"Winning Ways".  This paper is by David Applegate, Guy Jacobson, and
me, and it's entitled "computer analysis of sprouts".  (The paper has
not yet appeared in a journal, but it is technical report
CMU-CS-91-144 from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
University.  The postscript form of the paper is available via
anonymous ftp from the host "spade.pc.cs.cmu.edu" in the directory
"/usr/sleator/public".)

Here is a summary of the results we obtained:

  Number of spots:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  normal play:      L   L   W   W   W   L   L*  L*  W*  W*  W*
  mise`re play:     W   L   L   L   W*  W*  L*  L*  L*

  L indicates a win for the first player
  W indicates a win for the second player
  * indicates a new result obtained by our program

In normal play, the first player who cannot make a move loses, in
mise`re play the first player who cannot make a move wins.  These
results support the following two unproven conjectures:

  SPROUTS CONJECTURE: The first player has a winning strategy in n-spot
  sprouts if and only if n is 3, 4, or 5, modulo 6.

  MISE`RE SPROUTS CONJECTURE: The first player has a winning strategy in
  n-spot mise`re sprouts if and only if n is 0 or 1 modulo 5.

Are these patterns nothing more than an artifact of the "strong law of
small numbers" \cite{guy}, or are they real?  I think they are real.
Applegate thinks they are not real, and we have a bet riding on the
outcome of 10 spot mise`re.

The following is taken from the introduction of our paper:

Sprouts is a popular\footnote{at least in academic circles.} two-person
pencil-and player game.  It was invented in Cambridge in 1967 by Michael
Paterson, then a graduate student, and John Horton Conway, a professor of
Mathematics.

Sprouts is perhaps the most well-known and widely played of the topological
pencil-and-paper games discussed by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy in {\em
Winning Ways}~\cite{ww2}.  This popularity is largely due the exposure
provided by Martin Gardner in his {\em Mathematical Games\/} column in the
July 1967 issue of {\em Scientific American}.  The game is listed by David
Pritchard, editor of {\em The Gamer\/} magazine, in his compilation of the
world's best games for two~\cite{bg}.  Sprouts also occupies a prominent
place in Piers Anthony's science fiction novel {\em Macroscope}~\cite{ma},
where the hero's dormant genius is awakened by his exceptional skill at the
game.

The initial position of the game consists of a number of disconnected
points called spots.  Players alternate connecting the spots by
drawing curves between them, adding a new spot on each curve drawn.
Each curve must be drawn in the plane without touching itself or any
other curve or spot (except at the end points).  A single existing
spot may serve as both endpoints of a curve.  Furthermore, a spot may
have a maximum of three parts of curves connecting to it.  (Its degree
is bounded by three.)  A player who cannot make a legal move loses.
Figure \ref{sample-game} shows a sample game of two-spot Sprouts, with
the first player winning.  Since draws are not possible, either the
first player to move or the second player can always force a win,
regardless of the opponent's strategy.  Which of the players has this
winning strategy depends on the number of initial spots.
