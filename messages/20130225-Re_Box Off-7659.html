I'm looking for effective ways of creating new puzzles, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  I don't think working backwards necessarily works since you at least have to make sure you're not creating any irregular gaps in the process that can't later accomodate a box off move (e.g. a 1x1 box, or a 2x1 "L").

work backwards.

allow gaps.

maybe even put orange stones in the gaps and instruct to remove them at the start of the puzzle.

it might have aesthetic value even.

That works too, although it may result in a slightly easier puzzle since there would be fewer tiles remaining.

I think this works...

Work backwards, but don't make any moves that result in an odd sized gap.  That works because any even size gap can be filled in by some combination of 2x1 boxes (or larger).

This leads to the following strategy.  Don't make a move which leaves an odd sized gap.

(I strongly suspect their is a "parity" aspect to this puzzle)
