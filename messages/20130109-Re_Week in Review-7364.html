Your short term memory is failing, Christian.

If repetition rendered truth, Symple would be "great", "quintessential", and "perfect", which outlandish claims you've repeated ad nauseum in your Arimaa thread.  Unfortunately however, your madman repetition only renders extreme nausea.  BAAAAAARF!!!!!!

Self doubt well earned from a long history of failed attempts to educate you on game theory.  You have a well established pattern of spewing dogma (Symple is "perfect", "great", "quintessential") and then running for cover in your sheltered Arimaa thread where Omar the Buttfucker locks out my IPs.  And where Christian the Coward edits and deletes my posts which threaten his alternate reality.  Now you've emerged with newfound courage.  I'm still reeling from the shock.

Enlighten us, Gandalf.  What's the fuckin' difference?

I can hardly fucking wait.

You're a lot closer to the "shuffle board" than I am, Mt. Doom boy.  And getting closer by the day with your failing comprehension and short term memory loss.
