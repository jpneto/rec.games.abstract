Well Nick since I'm almost certain you posted this topic to talk about Shello I will go about giving it an off-the-cuff review. Firstly I don't think I agree with your assessment of Othello's gameplay, sure its certainly counter-intuitive but not the extent that it lacks clarity. Since Othello has fairly limited options of what you can play on a given turn it has a reasonable learning curve. That said this does offer and interesting "hot" alternative and might have more of a competitive feel, which would be a plus. I played only one game of Shello but it does seem practically finite although I'm sure there are cyclical positions that can be set up. Finally I would like to address your solution to the corners which is clever indeed. I feel the corners are really what hurt Othello's dynamism as the game tends to degenerate into trying to make tempo so you don't have to play around the corners. In my (limited) experience this gives Othello a very rigid progression and not much room for creative play. When my dad and I used to play, we'd play a pseudo-toroid variant where each row and column would feed into itself and each diagonal would also feed into itself. The result was pretty opaque but more enjoyable than regular Othello after we'd played it to death.
