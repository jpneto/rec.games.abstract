I, too, am in the process of creating an Abalone implementation.  However, 
mine will only act as a referee between 2-6 e-mail players.  The defensive
slowdown is a known problem.  However, I have had a couple of suggestions
sent my way...

1.  If any pushes are available, force player to do one of them.  This is
	similar to the forced jump in checkers.

2.	Allow movement of more than 3.  Longer chains can push more marbles.
	N pushes N-1.

: 	Thanks a lot in advance. 

Good luck.
