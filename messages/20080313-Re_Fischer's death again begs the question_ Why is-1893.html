I have asked this before on here I believe.  Well, the death of
Fischer begs the question once more.  I also posted this on Boardgame
geek:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/278704">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/278704</a>

Bobby Fischer's death is in the news, and causes people to remember
the 1970s, when chess was king, and people tuned into PBS to watch
chess. Chess was a culturally iconic back then. I remember reading
Mad Magazine when I was a kid, and they actually did a spoof with a
chess based superhero. Fischer made all the magazine covers, and it
was WWIII on the board. It wasn't just the Cold War either. When
America beat Russia in the Winter Olympics at hockey, and played
them, there wasn't an outbreak of hockey all over, like there was
with Chess. I remember when I was a kid in the 1970s, there was a
chess store that opened up near where I lived.

So, what has happened here? There is no chess on TV now. Rock, Paper,
Scissors made it to ESPN. Hot dog eating made ESPN. Poker is all over
TV. Scrabble is on TV also. But, there isn't chess. As far as I know,
no one has even bothered to pick up the rights to the World Mind
Sport Games in China either for western broadcast. The event has
Chess, Checkers, Go, Chinese Chess, and Bridge also, and is pretty
big event (first of its kind, and an offshoot of the Olympics).
There was a chess championship for over $1.5 million in Mexico last
year, and no one even knew of it, outside of the chess world.

So, again I ask, why is there no chess on TV? Also, any ideas what
can be done to get it on TV? Chess could open the doorway for a lot
of boardgames ending up on TV, if it could be on TV and remain
there. My take is the pacing of the moves, plus excessive amount of
draws where players score equally for the draw, are two major
factors why not.

Please don't get me started about American Gladiator being back, or
the fact that guys fixing motorcycles has a TV show. I can close by
saying a program about people have dirty jobs actually is on TV now.
Come on! All this and no chess?

I think the answer is because true chess enthusiasts don't watch much
TV.

I think the Internet or traditional publishing is a much better
medium.  I would love to download the game records of the Mexcian
chess tournament you mentioned, especially the top games (i.e.
longest) off of an Internet site and I would pay for that.

I remember watching chess on TV years before the Fischer Spassky match and 
for a couple years after.  It disappeared about the time  Fischer started to 
refuse to defend the title and I think that may've been a contributing 
factor to chess being removed from TV.  Fischer was viewed in the US as an 
American cold war hero.  How could TV get people to watch when the hero 
wouldn't participate anymore?  The general public wasn't interested in most 
matches, but many would tune in for a title match.  Well they already had 
the finale, they had nothing to follow it up with.

Best,
Bill
