which is correct?  is it that if it werent for this rule the king
would have been immune, so this rule takes that away?  boy, that is a
defect.

Sorry, I was unclear-- but yes, that is what I meant to say.  Since no one
can occupy the center square except the king, we institute a new special-
case rule to keep him from being invulnerable.

a game without defects isnt necessarily good.  tic-tac-toe has no defects,

Hmm-- I would disagree, actually; tic-tac-toe does have defects.  The
most obvious is that the minimax strategy is trivial, all perfect
games end in a draw, and the 3x3 and 3-in-a-row board size is arbitrary.
(of course, making the board size, #dimensions, and win-conditions 
variable is also a flaw, as the game then has too many variables... :-)
In Go, incidentally, people who understand the game far better than I do
assure me that the board size is not arbitrary, but that in truly 
understanding the game, one learns why the standard size is the perfect one.
