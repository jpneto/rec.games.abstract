Here's a little game-design challenge to anyone who wants to think
about an interesting problem.  I'm not going to pose the problem
rigorously, because I'm lazy.  Nonetheless:

There's an argument to be made in favor of the idea that an ideal game
is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> drawless.  The idea is that two perfect players should play
to a draw in an ideal game, and that any other outcome is both an
unseemly asymmetry, and a violation of the principle of fairness, to
be expunged.  So, what would draws in an ideal game be like?  Perhaps
an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.

So, my challenge to you is to design such a game.

One approach is to pick a drawn state, based on some set of criteria
that I can't quite fathom yet, and then ask yourself, "What game would
have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>this<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for its only draw?"  Ideally, you'd want there to be only
one possible game that could sensibly have that state for a draw.  But
there might be better ways of going about it.

I'm curious to see what gameplay would be like for a game with a
single known drawn. Conservative players might play toward the draw,
before one breaks away when he sees an opportunity for advantage.

Having a single known draw might increase the clarity in the game,
because players could use knowledge of the draw as a kind of guide to
play, as in the "conservative" play example mentioned above.  But I
could be completely wrong.

On the other hand, having a single drawn state may not be a very
worthy goal.  Maybe the real goal should be to have a game where draws
are possible, but where the draw ratio in actual play achieves a
theoretical non-zero minimum.  Basically, a game where a draw can only
occur between 2 perfect players, and no one else.

Is it possible to design a game where draws are possible, but nobody
except perfect players can ever get to it?  I suppose it requires that
nobody but perfect players even be able to imagine a drawn state.
This seems a ridiculous notion, but sometime the greatest insights can
come from dwelling on ridiculous notions. You'd need some set of rules
from which you can prove that draws are possible, but for which you
can provably only find the draws by being able to search the entire
game tree.

Also, Bill Taylor, if you read this: I've noticed that you sprinkle
your posts with design challenges.  It might be a cool idea to compile
a list of such challenges and then offer little Erdos prizes for those
who solve them.  Might be a way to stimulate more non-propaganda
discussion on this forum.  I wish there were more traffic here.  Is
there someplace where all the designers go to discuss abstract game
design?
