Interesting mechanism.  I remember seeing that in Hexplode, though I don't
know where the mechanism first appeared.

Hexplode:

Thanks, that's interesting. Never heard of it, but it was developed
around the same time. The English "Games &amp; Puzzles Magazine" appeared
from 1972-81 (just googled it). I had all back issues, ordered in the
late seventies. In one of them the game "Explosion" was described. It
was square and used the mechanism described, but it was somehow dull
or flawed or something.
Anyway, that was before 1982, when Hexplode is said to be developed.
Explocus is from the early eighties, and so is Breakthrough, the game
I made because I felt Martin had been trespassing into my territory :)

So "Explosion" is the first implementation, somewhere between 1972-79.
