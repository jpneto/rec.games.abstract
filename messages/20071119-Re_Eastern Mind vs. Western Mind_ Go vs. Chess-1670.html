Well, I for one knew very well that a lot of people have proposed this
(see your post in rec.games.board). However, that they are "highly
accomplished players" is exactly why I distrust their opinions: Of
course they would exaggregate the importance of their pastime! They
would love to think that it reflects something deeper about human
nature, and that they were the ones finding it!

Both military and business strategists have more than their share of
would-be Napoleons (and the latter are especially fond of writing
books!).

And for people who just play games and don't lower themselves much to
the real world: Look at the conspiracy theorists Fischer and
Kasparov... or the lovely soap opera that seems to be going on in
chess newsgroups (something about a stolen laptop, Susan Polgar and
some kooky ex-chess federation president)...

Just let games be games.
