New Game:

Here's one that I've just invented and begun playing, but it seems
promising, so I thought I'd post it here.  It doesn't have a name yet.
Please suggest one (or more)!  The rules aren't locked in yet.
Opinions solicited.

This is a very colorful connection game where the connection goals
slowly evolve as the game is played.  It has probably the biggest
branch factor of any game I've designed.  It should be played on a
very small board at first, due to its complexity.

This is played on any hexagonally tiled board.  I've been playing on a
hexhex board with 5 cells on a side, but I suspect it would be best on
an "almost" hexhex board with an even number of cells (i.e.  a little
bit elongated along one axis).  The rules:

------------------------------------------------------
Each player owns 2 stone-colors:

Player 1 owns the red and pink stones

Player 2 owns the blue and green stones.

1.  To begin, player 1 places either a red or pink stone on any empty
space.

2.  From then on, starting with player 2, each player places two
stones, one of each of his colors, onto any two empty spaces on the
board.  The player may play his colors in any order.

3.  The game ends when the board is full.

4.  Player with the higher score wins, with scores calculated as
follows:

Each of Player 1's red groups (even a single red stone is considered a
"group") gets a score.  A red group's score is the total number of
blue stones in the blue groups that the red group touches.  In
addition, each red group gets 1 bonus point for every side of the
board it touches.

Each of Player 2's green groups (even a single green stone is
considered a "group") gets a score.  A green group's score is the
total number of pink stones in the pink groups that the green group
touches. In addition, each green group gets 1 bonus point for every
side of the board it touches.

If the highest scoring red group has a higher score than the highest
scoring green group, player 1 ones.

If the highest scoring green group has a higher score than the highest
scoring red group, player 2 ones.

If the highest scoring green group has the same score as the highest
scoring red group, then compare the 2nd highest scoring red and green
groups, and so on.

If it's tied all the way down the line, the game is a draw.
--------------------------------------------------------

I'm not certain whether the bonus points are worthwhile.  I put them
in there to make it more worthwhile to play you're connecting color
near the edges, and your "defended color" not always near the edges.
But I don't have a deep understanding of the game's dynamics.
