Baloney pie.   Christian, you can't possibly be claiming that Symple is the
"perfect game".  Mine eyes perceive it but it's too outlandish a claim, even
from you, for me to process.

Now you think about it.

A simple thought experiment.  Play your perfect game on a 3x3 board and
watch it crumble.  Next play it on a 5x5.  Increase the board size until the
move order advantage becomes negligible.  Now you've got the perfect game
***for your current skill level***

The mythical perfect game would never have unbearable kludges such as
Symple's

"There's one exception to the above. If, and only if, neither player has
grown yet, then black on his turn may use both the above options in the
above order: he may place a stone, therewith creating a new group, and he
may grow any or all of his other (!) groups."

and:

"A player's score is counted as the number of stones he has placed on the
board minus four points for every separate group."
