 If people are going to sell
Go boards with a sheet of rules in the package next to Chess,
Checkers, and Backgammon in the stores... they just need to include
the Tromp-Taylor counting rules on the instruction sheet. Those are
simple, unambiguous, and easy to understand.

After reading Tromp-Taylor rules as written by co-author and notable
designer Bill Taylor, it doesn't seem to be quite as simple as you
suggest.

  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/tmp/rules/TrompTaylor.html">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~wjh/go/tmp/rules/TrompTaylor.html</a>

The "Tromp-Taylor Concise Rules of Go" section is divided into two
subsections: "The Logical Rules" and "Comments and Interpretations".
The "Logical Rules" section seems to be fairly straightforward, but
the "Comments and Interpretations" section gets a little hairy.  The
de facto FAQ that follows only adds to the hairiness.  I sure didn't
understand it.

Prefacing the rules specification is Bill's admonishment "The
['Comments and Interpretations' section is] merely about those matters
that real live players have to worry about for reasons of convenience,
impatience, and a desire (usually) to play with physical equipment."

If you include a rule sheet in a game box, you're obviously targeting
the "real live players" that Bill mentions.  And so logically, the
incomprehensible (at least to me) "Comments and Interpretations"
section would be indicated for inclusion in an in-box rule sheet.
