I want to clarify my position. Thanks to this conversation I had
changed my mind. The multi-move factor doesn't change the size of the
game-tree.

The reason why it has a so big game-tree complexity is because Ecalper
is (more or less) a three-move game.

How many possible moves in Oust does the player have in the second
turn? I think it's 120. In Ecalper, however, during the second turn
player has 930372 possible moves to choose from.

This, to me, is a strong clue Ecalper has a bigger game-tree
complexity than Outs (with a fair and meaningful number of turns).

But what I believe now is that a multi-move game is deeper despite the
same game-tree size.

Here I'm talking about the intuitive concept of 'depth'. I have tried
to explain my position here:

I'm not good in English, so I hope I am/was intelligible.

This is my temporary position, but I'm open to change it in case.

This shows my point. The tree has the same size, but the game is more
difficult because we are forced to look more ahead. Of course too much
depth can cause game's opacity... but by now the game seems to be not
opaque.
