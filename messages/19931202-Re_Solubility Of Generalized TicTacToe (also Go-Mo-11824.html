Does it make a difference if, in all paths down the tree, no useful
moves are made into a strip of width 5 around the edge - that is, if
neither player gains by making a move just barely outside the playing
field? In this case, can the rest of the plane be safely ignored? It
seems to me intuitively that it can, but I cannot convince myself
logically of it. I apologize for the impreciseness of my description -
this may be why I can't find the proof. :)

I played gomoku a lot when I was a kid.  The best games took up the
whole 19x19 board.  In fact it was edge and corner play that decided
many games.  Some times I would start a game near a corner (on a
"black spot"); the game would be quite different from the usual.
What you are thinking, may be that a play outside of 15x15 only
requires one counterplay--but that is not true, since a stone can
attack along several lines.  By the way, what is the smallest board
on which first player wins?  Also, does the 15x15 "solution" handle
off-center openings?
