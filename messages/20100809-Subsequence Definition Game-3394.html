This is a game for any plural number of players.

In the first part of the game the players take turns, each player
picking any one nonnegative integer to be appended to the end of a
growing list of integers. The first part of the game is over when m
integers are picked, where m is a positive integer agreed upon before
the game by the players, and where m is a multiple of the number of
players.

Let the finite sequence of integers be {a(k)}, 1 &lt;= k &lt;= m.

The players, in the second part of the game, take turns each coming up
with a definition that describes some subsequence of {a(k)}. If the
last integer in the subsequence defined by the previous player is
a(j), then the currently moving player tries to find a definition that
defines
(a(j+1), a(j+2), a(j+3),..., a(j+n)),
for some positive integer n.

The subsequence must be any n consecutive terms of a sequence of
infinite number of terms defined by "the definition". The definition
must either be of the form "b(k) =..." (function of k) or "{b(k)} are
those integers which are...", where {b(k)} contains an infinite number
of terms. Again, a(j+k) = b(h+k),
for some h and for all k where 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n.

(Note: Definitions must be finite in length. The sequence {b(k)} must
be well-defined.)

The currently moving player gets added to their score

n - 2*(the number of specific numbers {ordinal or cardinal, real,
complex, whatever} that occur in their definition).


When all m integers have been described, then the game is over.

Largest score wins.

It is easy to play (cheat) with the use of a computer with access to
the internet.
Log on to The On-Line Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://oeis.org/classic/">http://oeis.org/classic/</a>
Plug all numbers from a(j+1) to a(m) into the search field. If nothing
comes up, remove one integer from the end of the list. Keep removing
an integer from the end of the list (ie. reduce n by 1) until a
sequence comes up. If the definition has lots of specific numbers in
it, then with the scoring system, it may be better to try for a match
with a shorter subsequence.

Of course, if one plays this without resorting completely to the OEIS,
then maybe they will invent new sequence definitions not in the OEIS
that would be worthy candidates for submission to the database.

Any problems you can see with the game? (Of course there are.)

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
