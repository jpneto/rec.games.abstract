Thank you for the post; I enjoyed your web site and would like
to take a look at your graph theoretic results when I find some
spare time.  Your game would be related to DAO which in fact was
discussed here last month -- you can search groups.google.com for
group:rec.games.abstract DAO; rules below.  Tentative conclusion
by this group, was "draw"; perhaps your program can be modified
to furnish an easy proof.  Honestly, your game sounds more
interesting than DAO although I would need some time &amp; info in
order to visualize your analysis and draw conclusions regarding
its viability as a game.  Have you playtested it against yourself?

Thanks! Yes, it surely resembles Dao. My program
creates a table over the number of remaining moves
by perfect play for all positions, so the 2 x 4
instead of 2 x 3 pieces may be just a little too
much to handle. I have played Neutreeko against
myself and it seems alright. Two years ago I
considered a similar game where the pieces only
moved one square at the time. There were perfect
matches with up to 17 moves and very few draws,
but the problem was that the players could set
up threats all the time and there seemed to be
too little room for creativity. I think Neutreeko
is better in that respect. Yesterday, I found
that there were only 2 ways to complete a match
until there were only 6 moves left starting from
the "most advanced" position and playing perfectly.
But there may be many possible deviations for
white where it is still hard for black to find
the win.

The rules of Dao appear to be:

1. Start in this position:

   O . . X
   . O X .
   . X O .
   X . . O

2. X moves first, and then players alternate.

3. A move consists of moving one piece horizontally, vertically, or
   diagonally.  The piece must move at least one space, and must keep
   moving in that direction until it reaches the edge of the board, or
   the next space is already occupied.

4. A player wins by achieving any of the following.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a horizontal or vertical row.  All four of the
   player's pieces in a 2x2 square.  All four of the player's pieces in
   the four corners.  One of the player's pieces in a corner and the
   three adjacent spaces all occupied by the other player.

By combining the rules of Neutron and Teeko,
I came up with a game that I have described
at the bottom of

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm">http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/games.htm</a>

with emphasis on the computer analysis that
I have done. There isn't any graphics or
anything so far, but hopefully some will
find it interesting anyway. The web page
may become updated now and then over the
next few days and weeks.
