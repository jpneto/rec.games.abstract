<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hi,
<br>
<br>&nbsp; I know <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@gamerz.net">pbmserv@gamerz.net</a>, I use to play GO by mail. I know for Flash 
6, we discover the problem for Linux after production. We are looking to 
know if they will upgrade on linux platform (Flash 6 is far more stable 
than Flash 5, and the application to play online weight only 38 Ko). I 
will let you know.

<br>Any chance of you downgrading to a more universally supported version of
<br>flash?

<br>&nbsp; I'm the author of a new abstract strategy game mamba. I've seen a 
message from Sacha about the game... just few things to add, yes the 
game is based on alife aspects (ie the pieces are alive) and yes the 
concept is more similar to Go than chess. But one important thing, is 
that this game is a king of dynamic system to play with so after any 
action we bring the balance back on the board... we discover very 
funny tactics for the game... a kind of guerilla strategy is the 
better way to play for the moment.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; You can play online at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mambagame.com">http://www.mambagame.com</a>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have organize few tournaments... and we will continue to do so.
