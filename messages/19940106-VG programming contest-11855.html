International "Four Play" Programming Contest (2. tournament)

In this contest, we are seeking the best "Four Play" program. Although 
the rules are simple and a match is short (compared to Go or Chess), 
"Four Play" is a fascinating game, which is worth to be considered 
now detailed. In the contest, different strategies and algorithms 
will be examined.
As both tournaments are carried out independently, you can still
participate without problems.

Rules of the game:
Two players put pieces on a 7-by-6-board, which stands upright on the 
longer edge. Both players put alternately a piece of their own colour 
into one of the rows of the board. The piece falls down according to 
gravity. The goal is to get 4 pieces into a line. All directions count 
(horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Who can do this first is the winner. 
If, after 21 moves, nobody has won, the game ends in a draw.
Here comes one example situation, where player 'x' has won.
The move sequence was 4,4,4,4,3,5,5,3,6,3,3.

As programming environment, a library with some basic functions (e.g. 
Who has won in a certain situation?) and a judge will be available. 
Other aid (like operating system library functions) is not allowed.

Contest organisation:
*	Hardware: SparcStations
*	Operating System: SUN OS 4.1.1
*	Programming Language: C/C++
*	C-Compiler: gcc (GNU)
*	5 min per match for every player

Dead lines:
The contest will start at January 30, 1994. Until then, all participating
programs have to be developed and tested (!). Results and match protocols
will be delivered by email on demand. 

Who can participate?
Everybody who can send and receive e-mail; basic knowledge in C is required.
We suggest to form teams of 2 up to 4 persons, but, of course, individual
competitors are welcome as well.
