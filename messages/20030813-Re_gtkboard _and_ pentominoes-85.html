No, no!  :-)  But if you're going to develop a "graphics-intensive"
application (in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> sense of the term :)), then it's probably not going to be
portable unless you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>work<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> at portability from the get-go. And the gtkboard
people don't seem to have worked at portability. So yeah, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> make a
graphical game engine that was nicely partitioned up into "engine" and "GTk"
and "OpenGL" and whatever, but I wouldn't want to do it.

In short, the emphasis was on the "only" part, not the "Linux" part.

Fair enough.  I agree that the gtk people don't seem to have had that
motivation (I wish I were wrong about that).  But even beyond the graphics
part, they seem to be using non-standard C.  At least one of the routines
mentioned in the "how to write code for this project" page, snprintf (or
something like that), doesn't appear in any of the standard C references on
my bookshelf.  So platform portability seems to have left out of the
equation, even in things unrelated to graphics.

If I'm right about that, it's a sad choice on their part.  In <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> opinion,
of course.  Hard to pick on someone who's providing a nice package for free,
just because it doesn't suit <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>my<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> needs.
