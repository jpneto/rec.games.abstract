The game I'm referring to did not occur in the final match that
Kasparov lost but rather in an earlier match that Kasparov won.
I may be wrong but I believe computer printouts later verified the
correctness of the assertion.  Also, it was not just Kasparov's
assertion; others said the same thing.  I'm not aware of any
knowledgeable persons who made a contradictory claim about the
position in question.

Well, I agree: you may be wrong.

Your statement, "Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons," is just wrong.

I'm not aware of even a single instance where a computer program
sacrificed a piece when it was not able to search the subsequent
position to a depth where it would regain the piece.  If you know
of any examples, I would welcome seeing them.  Otherwise, I stand
by my statement.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

First, your quoted statement doesn't say a sacrifice of a piece (not
just a pawn, or some exchange of theoretically negative material
value).  Secondly, the fact that something doesn't generally happen
(because in the situations where it might occur, the computer that's
strong enough to make the move is also strong enough to search the
resulting variations) doesn't mean that it's "not supposed to be
possible".  It just means that it doesn't often happen with existing
programs in usual play.  That's a long way from impossibility.
