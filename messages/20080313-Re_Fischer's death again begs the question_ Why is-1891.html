<br>Well put.

<br>Do we say that scoring 1 point for a free throw and 2 for a field goal in 
basketball
<br>"penalizes" free throws? Do we say that scoring 3 points for a field goal in
<br>American football, while 6 points for a touchdown, "penalizes" field goals? Of 
course not.
<br>
<br>We are simply trying to design a scoring system that produces the
<br>"best" competitions, where "best" is debatable but should include things like
<br>fun to play, fun to watch etc.
<br>
<br>Chess' existing scoring (draw = one half of a win) does produce
<br>collusion, big time. The last rounds of many tournaments are a
<br>flurry of quick, uncontested draws. Why? Because the leaders
<br>calculate that the return on playing for a win is low,
<br>so they play the famous "grandmaster draw" (essentially collude not to play and
<br>split the point) and go home with a guaranteed prize. This behavior
<br>is a function of the scoring system. If we changed the scoring system so that
<br>the return of playing for a win were higher, we get more players playing for
<br>wins. So it produces collusion to play chess vs. the existing system which 
produces
<br>collusion to not play chess. A straightforward improvement, if you ask
<br>me.
