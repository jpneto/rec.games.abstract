But being too late? Can you, really? The overall position will make
possible loops more and more likely for both players.
The first to decline implicitly subjects him/herself to the
restriction first. So in an even game, both get increased chances, and
both can afford to wait because whoever goes first gives his/her
opponent an equal chance, generally speaking.

Tough, important question (thx very much for taking the time to think
about this. your insight is invaluable in helping me to see where to
focus)

As long as there's sufficient space on the board (not sure what
sufficient is exactly), you can often find spots for neutrals that
seem to help you more than your opponent, in the sense that they
contribute to a potential frame for you which is smaller than any of
the potential frames of your opponents' to which it contributes. At
some point, as the board starts to get crowded, that must end.  But I
have no idea when though. Trying to figure it out is melting my
brain.
