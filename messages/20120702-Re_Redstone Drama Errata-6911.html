The original version of Redstone, which I called Cancer, was conceived from start to finish while driving on a highway at night.  To me that makes it "purely cerebral".  Although since Christian, our resident non-native English speaking European takes issue with my understanding of "cerebral", who am I to disagree?

The only thing "purely mental", barring Mark himself, was the idea of using neutral stones in a Go concept.

The best inventions are the ones that seem obvious in hindsight.  Yet somehow Redstone, simple and obvious as it is, eluded you and everyone else before I stumbled onto it.

Yes, it did.  In spades.

Yes, they can.  What are all these "points" that I missed, Christian (from the Shello thread), other than cancerous eyes being an undesirable feature?  If "it's all here", as you claim, you should be able to reference at least one of these "points" that I missed.

Someone left a wigged out message in the Game Site X chat about being a potato, and then not really being a potato, having dirty fingernails, etc.  As a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>joke<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, I said that Christian came unglued.  Later Christian was fucked up about that, and I told him directly that it was a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>joke<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Apparently he's still determined to insult himself at my expense, so have it your way Mr. Potatohead.

You're on my mind because of the humongous thread you've created in the Arimaa forum, dwarfing the whole rest of the forum - 63 pages of you licking your own nut sack.  I've never met anyone, in any field of endeavor, so enamored with the flavor of their own scrotum.  

"I need a committee to help me sort out which of my games are most significant, blah blah blah blah blah."  Holy shit!  It's the sheer volume of saliva.  Buckets of it!  

You're not that important, Christian.  You've got a couple of good games.  Corey Clark has a couple of good games.  Nick Bentley has a couple of good games.  I have a couple of good games.  Welcome to the club, Christian.  Nothing in your portfolio elevates you above the rest of the pack.  All of your profound "significance" exists solely in your mind.
