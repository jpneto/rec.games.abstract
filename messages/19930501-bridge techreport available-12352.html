Pragmatic Reasoning in Bridge

Technical Report No. 299
University of Cambridge
Computer Laboratory
April 1993

Abstract:

In this paper we argue that bidding in the game of Contract Bridge can
profitably be regarded as a micro-world suitable for experimenting with 
pragmatics. We sketch an analysis in which a ``bidding system'' is treated
as the semantics of an artificial language, and show how this ``language'',
despite its apparent simplicity, is capable of supporting a wide variety of
common speech acts parallel to those in natural languages; we also argue
that the reason for the relatively unsuccessful nature of previous attempts
to write strong Bridge playing programs has been their failure to address
the need to reason explicitly about knowledge, pragmatics, probabilities
and plans. We give an overview of {\sc Pragma}, a system currently under 
development, which embodies these ideas in concrete form, using a 
combination of rule-based inference, stochastic simulation, and 
``neural-net'' learning. Examples are given illustrating the 
functionality of the system in its current form.

[This is almost identical to our paper from the 1990 Computer
Olympiad, slightly updated to reference work which has taken place
since then.]
