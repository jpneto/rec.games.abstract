None, by definition.  There is no such thing as a problem that
needs a quantum computer to analyze.  You can do it all with a 
Turing Machine, because a Turing Machines can simulate all
possible computers.

The reason everyone is so interested in Quantum Computers is the
potentially speed at which (in theory) they can solve certain 
problems.  The reason we aren't all sitting in front of Turing 
Machines is the slow speed at which they solve most problems.
That, and the fact that the local office supply store always seems
to be out of stock of infinite tapes.

While there has been progress in practical implementation of Quantum
Computing since it was written (in 1999), the theory of the case
remains about where David Deutsch left it in his classic paper:
Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics (David Deutsch, Artur Ekert,
Rossella Lupacchini)  In that paper, the convenience of thinking that
all computing can be reduced to an equivalent Turing machine is
considered and rejected.

"As a matter of fact, Richard Feynman, in his talk during the First
Conference on the Physics of Computation held at MIT in 1981, observed
that it appears to be impossible to simulate a general quantum
evolution on a classical probabilistic computer in an efficient way
[4]. That is to say, any classical simulation of quantum evolution
involves an exponential slowdown in time compared with the natural
evolution, since the amount of information required to describe the
evolving quantum state in classical terms generally grows
exponentially with time."

The above quote doesn't say that a Turing machine cannot simulate
a Quantum Computer, only that it cannot do so in an efficient way,
which is what I originally wrote.  Do you have a quote supporting 
your claim that a Turing machine cannot simulate all computers?
