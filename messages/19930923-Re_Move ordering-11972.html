It's obvious that a trying good moves first improves alpha-beta
performance.  I'm somewhat baffled as to what a good move-ordering
might look like.  It seems like a chicken-and-egg proglem:  How do I
tell the good moves from the bad BEFORE I do the search?

The best thing I can think of is to make each proposed move, call your
evaluation function, and sort on this result to get the move-ordering
for the recursive search.

There are lots of possible heuristics.  One common one has to do with
piece safety - it is fairly cheap to do a quick analysis of pieces
attacking and defending a given square.  If it appears that an opponent's
piece can be gainfully captured (e.g. it is undefended, or attacked by
a piece of lesser value), then such capture moves are tried early on.
Similarly, if the side to move has pieces that appear to be en prise
(subject to gainful capture), then moves that transfer them to apparently
safe squares are tried early.  (I say "apparently" here because a static
analysis of safety one square at a time is imperfect and there may be
situations where it is not accurate).

Other heuristics involve keeping lists of moves that have proven to
generate good scores elsewhere in the search tree.  For example, moves
that caused beta cutoff may be kept in a list (sometimes these are
called "killer" moves).  If the same move is legal elsewhere in the
tree at the same depth, it will be moved up in the search order, on the
theory that a move that is good in another position may be good in this
one, too.  There are several variations of this scheme.
