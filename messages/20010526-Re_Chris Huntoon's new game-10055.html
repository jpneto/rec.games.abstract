I first played more than 10 games with compulsory jumping, then, after
I read your mail several games, without.

I strongly disagree that it makes a richer game. I respect your decision
and your rules, but I don't share your opinion.

In early Draughts there was no compulsory capturing, this game was called
"Le Jeu de Dames Plaisant" (i.e. "The Friendly Game). It was in the 16th
century replaced by Draughts played with compulsory capturing called "Le
Jeu de Dame Force" (i.e. "The Forced Game"). The reason why it was
replaced are much the same why I view Gorgon played with compulsory
capturing as being the superior game:

Compulsory capturung results in strategy and tactics becoming  more
balanced. I find your game too strategical.

Although your game can be played without compulsory capturing, many nice
techniques are not possible. If you have compulsory capturing, you can
"force" moves, which are beautiful sacrifices. For instance, you can
sacrifice one piece and get two in return, you can sacrifice one piece and
force your opponent in a bad position, you can sacrifice one stone and
have some possibilities to move again, you can sacrifice one stone and
breakthrough to the upper (lower) edge of the board. There are numerous
other possible techniques which are lost to your game, because a player
just wouldn't jump if that's bad for him. It's true: I am very much
influenced by traditional Checker variants (Altdeutsche Dame being one of
my favorite variants, the others are Frisian Draughts and International
Draughts)), but a Checker-like game without compulsory capturing is like
meat without spices or a pudding without sugar. It is sort of a "castrated"
game for me. BTW many new Go variants appear to me like "castrated" Go,
compared to "real" Go.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think we need to remember the key term is Checkers-LIKE.    Gorgon was
originally developed without any particular game in mind.  Only during the
final phases was a similarity between it and Checkers realized and a conscious
decision made to borrow strictly the set-up and movement from Old German
Checkers simply because they suited the needs of the game.  Labeling Gorgon as
a Checkers variant and then in turn insisting that it retain all the key
elements of Checkers is a misjudgment.

Another key strategic element found in Checkers but missing from Gorgon is that
of promotion.  One of the considerations I wrestled with at the beginning is
what to do when the pieces reach the edge.  Technically they would be unable to
move and so would effectively stalemate the game.  However, this really did not
fit in the spirit of the game, which involved the careful playing of pieces
against one another rather than reaching some arbitrary border.  Promoting
pieces could lead to scenario where a promoted piece is surround by a ring of
stones but can still move freely back and forth over the same squares and thus
become invincible.  (Another alternative was to have pieces reverse their
orientation when reaching the edge and then only move backwards, which felt too
awkward to me.)  So I borrowed an idea from Cylindrical Chess and connected the
top to the bottom to from a continuous field.   Consequently, the usual
considerations of "top", "bottom" and "middle" become subjective rather than
fixed and indeed tend to get lost altogether as play progresses.  I think you
agree that the absence of promotions enhances the game rather than make it feel
like "castrated" Checkers.  

I agree with you that compulsory captures are an aspect of Checkers that makes
it such a great game and precisely for the reasons you gave.  In fact, if you
look at the other games I’ve created, you’ll find a number of them do
include forced captures.  As I said I did originally try the use of compulsory
captures with Gorgon.  When including any element in a game consideration
should be given to its over all affect on game play and not including it for
its own sake.  So let’s examine why I didn’t use compulsory captures.

Petrifying a piece not only effectively removes that piece from play for the
rest of the game, but furthermore obstructs moving and jumping for not only
your opponent but also yourself.  So one must carefully weigh the long-term
benefits against the risks.  The decision whether or not to petrify a piece is,
in and of itself, an important strategic consideration.

Theoretically the game could be won without performing any petrifactions.  If
you look at the endgame you’ll find about just as many pieces blockaded by
live pieces as those blockaded by stones.  In Checkers jumping pieces in order
to remove them from play is often an end unto itself.  In Gorgon, jumping
pieces in order to petrify them is merely a means to an end.

In Checkers, jumped pieces are removed from the board.  This is turn opens up
the board and allows for more maneuverability as the game progresses.  In
Gorgon, the reverse is true, as the game progresses the board becomes
increasingly congested and maneuverability becomes more confined.  The very
natures of the two games are quite different from each other.

Lets look at Gorgon played with forced captures.  The same basic scenario would
keep coming up: the pieces would invariably clash in the middle and a "wall" of
stones would form.  This in turn would create a delineated top, middle and
bottom.  Worst of all the overall range of choices open to the players would
quickly become limited.

It's perfectly o.k. to borrow ideas from other games as long as one does
not pretend something else. There are a few more Checker variants such as
Armenian Checker or T=FCrk Damasi (Turkish Checker) in "Europe" (Europe
defined as a cultural space) which use both colors.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Turkish Checkers involves movement in three directions and Armenian Checkers
involves movement in five directions and both variants allow pieces to move
freely between the dark and light squares.  In Old German Checkers movement is
restriced to two directions (except for jumping) and pieces always stay on the
same colored squares.  This was the kind of restrictive mechanics I was looking
for in Gorgon.  I already had something quite similiar in mind even before I
decided to look at the family of Checkers games for help.

Well, I know already that you are a very honest person and probably
American.

You probably know that I have included Tourney in my book project (i just
finished my first proofreading). I would include Gorgon, if compulsory
"petrifying" would be an acceptable variant to you.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


When playtesting Gorgon with and without compulsory jumps there really was no
clear winner between the two methods.  I personally feel that forced jumps
should be left out of the game for the reasons I gave above.  Although having
compulsory jumps would certainly be an acceptable "variant."  After all, each
approach has its own unique strategic possibilities (not necessarily "better"
but definitely different.)  :-)

This book does not only
provide the complete rules of a game, but also some background information
(such as history, who is the inventor, tournament life, etc). You could
answer to my e-mail address giving me any information about yourself
which I could publish (profession, hobbies, year of birth, why you invent
games, what are your favorite games...)

I've always had a poor time writing about myself.  But I'll see what I can do.
