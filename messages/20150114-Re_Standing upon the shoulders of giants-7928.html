Inventing games DO NOT NEED prior knowledge. No giant is needed.

Agreed, but what if one is already there. Dameo is the best example: all essentials were provided by Ljuban's Croda, which in itself is an improvement of International Draughts (and deliberately created as such).

Erase all what was done and start from what you feel could be another starting point. 
The creativity must be like a big bang now that the computer could ease any desire of the game designers. Another game`s universe is ready to be created. But people are enslaved by the what-it-has-to-be-done imposed by the Ayatollahs of the game design.

I'm not sure if that, in your opinion, would include me. In any case I'm usually willing to comment on how I went about it, not on how others should go about it. Occasionally I'm impressed though.

To learn about Grand Chess and Dameo, I suggest you visit the ArenA:

Googling either gives a fair amount of information too.
