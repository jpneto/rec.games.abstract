It is
a way to do Capablanca Random Chess, without needing a bigger board.
There is also the risks when you play on the 10x8 board that the
Gothic Chess Federation will sue you if you do anything that comes in
range of matching their patented configuration.

Sounds like, at this point, for those who think that pocket Princess

That is a criticism of Seirawan or other games.  There are ways to do
restrictions to prevent the congestion from happening, such as only
allow the pocket pieces to get on the board per each capture.

and who would like a
more conventional game at the cost of a larger board, I should note my

Your game can be integrated into the IAGO Chess framework actually.
One thing it should hopefully to is allow people a chance to buy those
pieces you have.  As of now, they can't.  As far as on the
foundational level, there are problems with going with a larger
board.  The top one is you can't acquire it.  Rationalizations that
"making your own is cool", doesn't quite cut it.  It is also too much
of a jump for normal chess players.  I will say your desired end fits
with a lot of other people, particularly those who are involved with
the chess variant site.

By the way, consider looking at IAGO Chess, and seeing what you can do
in order to be able to get your game functioning:
