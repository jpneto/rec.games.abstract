...and also works by the same "divergent telescoping cancellation" as before.

Hmmm...  I wonder if this should be called "Microscoping Cancellation" - it
makes things bigger and bigger as you go along...

Anyway:-   S =  1 + 4 + 16 + 64 +...

Thus  1 + 3S =  1 + 4 + 16 + 64 +...
              + 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 +...
              + 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 +...
              + 1
             =  0 + 0 +  0 +  0 +...   with exact carrying everywhere, no chads.

So  S = - 1/3 ,  as requid.

This is OC the 4-adic calculation writ large, as implied by David.

This sort of crass summation often gives the same answer even when computed by
different methods. Has it really developed into a field yet? Here are a few
questions for fun:

1) 1+2+3+5+8+13+...=?
It looks like one should be able to make sense of a sum of terms based on a linear
recurrence relation, though usually not p-adically. How about 1+2+6+24+120+...,
which does make sense p-adically?

2) In case one has combinatorial games with values 1, 2, 4, etc., does their
combinatorial sum ever represent anything resembling -1?

3) Is there a value of the Petersburg paradox game when the payoff is (-3)^n with
probability 1/2^n? Of course one can get a value from this silliness, but consider
this modification: Suppose that when I win, (and get paid 9, 81, 729, etc.) I have
to pay a proportion of my winnings in taxes, but my gambling losses are not tax
deductible. Am I worse off? Not by the summation methods used here.

This is actually relevant to the analysis of a strange position in backgammon in
which the equity of certain strategies does not exist.
