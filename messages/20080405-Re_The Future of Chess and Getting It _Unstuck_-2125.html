Taking that statement literally, one might have expected you to
complain when the 50-move rule was modified to allow more moves in
some endgame positions proven by computer studies to require more than
50 moves to achieve mate.

But I presume you mean that if someone wants his chess variant to
become more popular than chess, you want it to happen honestly, by
popular demand - not by bribing someone at the USCF, as it were, to
hijack the existing infrastructure built up by people who joined it in
order to play Chess the way it is.

I have no problems with that position; I admire honesty and detest
sneakiness in general.

But there is another side to that argument. When they brought in the
rule about drawing for the first two, and then three, moves of
Checkers, it wasn't because someone wanted to egotistically put his
stamp on the game. It was because there was a problem generally
recognized as existing by the Checkers community.

If Chess players worldwide recognize that Chess has problems similar
in magnitude, then for the existing Chess federations to get directly
involved with experimentation with Chess variants in an attempt to
find a solution to the problems would be a legitimate activity. I'm
dubious that the problems are, yet, that serious, and that a Chess
variant would be effective in addressing them, but in principle this
can be as legitimate in the Chess world as it was in the Checkers
world. (And cleaning up Go scoring to handle bent four in the corner
better is another example.)
