There weren't many snippets for Dragon Poker in the books, and those that were
mentioned were for Deva anyways... 8)

But ANYONE could know all the rules for Dragon Poker, since there were copies
of the rules and modifiers for pretty much every dimension, including Klah
which didn't even have that much dimensional travel.  And at least in informal
games you could look in the book during a game.  Of course that would put you
as an "easy" mark for a highstakes game....
