Here's a series of chess games that are very abstract: non-euclidian chess.

In topological terms when I say "sew" two tiles together it means to
declare them adjacent by fiat:

Spherical Chess: You would declare every boundry tile to be adjacent.
Alternately [I think preferably, but who am I?] you could have 
an "extra" square off of the chess board that was adjacent to every 
square on the border of the board. [This would correspond to a one 
point compactification of the plane.] These might not be too interesting  
unless you changed the position of the chess men since the
game would start very near check. [Excercise: How close to checkmate is it?]

Cylinderical Chess: Sew together the left and right sides of the board.
I.E., You would allow players to jump off the left side and
land on the right. Thus your rooks would be adjacent. [If you sewed the
board together the other way, your Queens would be adjacent, and the game
would start with Black in check. Excercise: Mate?.]

M\"oebius Band Chess: Same as cylinderical chess except that you sew the two
sides together with a twist. Now both the opponent's rooks sit right next
to each other.

Klein Bottle Chess: Now we sew the top and bottom on directly [the queens
now sit next to each other], and we sew the sides together with a twist [so
the opponent's rooks sit next to each other.]

Projective Plane Chess: Sew the top and bottom on with a twist, and sew the
left and right to each other with a twist. Note that now all four rooks are
adjacent to each other.

Compact 2-Manifold Chess: Now for the daddy of all "flat" chess variations:
Every two manifold has R^2 as a Universal Cover. Tile R^2 like a chess board
and lay it down on the Manifold of your choice. Now you have a "black and
white tiling" on your manifold. Put your pieces on it and play.

Grand-daddy of "flat" chess variations:
Topological Chess: Take arbitrary combinations of 2-manifolds, make each
into a 2-Manifold Chess board, and sew arbitrary tiles together.

R^2 Chess: This is my favorite. Play chess on R^2 tiled appropriately.
Since this is an unbounded chess board, you could:
 1) Move your Queen, rook, bishop, arbitrarily far away. This means
    that the enemy can never really escape you (unless you lose these pieces!)
 2) Pawns can never be promoted.
 3) One could quibble over the point at infinity.
As ridiculous as this sounds, you could probably impliment this on a computer
and just limit the board to some arbitrarily large number (4 trillion on a PC.)
Then your coordinates would be: BlackQueen(12345,548932), etc.
