Hello,

yesterday I got Wayne Schmittberger's book "New Rules for Classic Games.

It's quite interesting, though I mistrust the book after I found several
blunders:

His suggested rule to avoid draws in Halma (for two players) is utter
nonsense as both sides can achieve a draw in only four moves as every
pre-school kid could easily find out.
(Hint: just move the four pieces at the edge forward and then move with
your corner pieces eternally forwards and backwards).

The wonderful German game of Salta has been invented in 1899 (not in 1901)
and is quite different from Halma (shame on Schmittberger). What is worst,
the goal of Salta has been described wrong, but that's the way how
English and American authors ruin our game. FYI, I have the copy of a
Salta book from the 1900s and was in touch with the grandson of the
inventor (Conrad Buettgenbach, a German composer) about 12 years ago, so
i'm definately not open for any discussions with would-be game experts!

I wonder what "Central-South German Checkers" means. I learned this
variant from friends when I was still at school, but I was definately not
living in the south of Germany. We just called it "Dame" (checkers). Also,
what is "Central Germany"? After 400 years of lost wars (starting with
the 30years War), everything which has been left of Germany could be
called "Central Germany", though this might not be politally correct
language!!! There is just no geographical region which is called
"Central-South Germany".

"Gothic Checkers" is today called in German "Altdeutsche Dame" (i.e.
Old German Checkers), in old sources: "Altdeutsches Damm-Spiel" to be
exact.

Schmittberger states:

"Kings may not move or capture at a distance; however; they may only capture
adjacent  pieces and must land immediately beyond them."

I have lots of German gamebooks, old and new, and many copies from even
more books, but this rule is definately NOT mentioned in any of them.
Sure, the king ("Damm") may capture from a distance.
Schmittberger must have a little bit too much phantasy. BTW, Altdeutsche
Dame is rooted in Turkish Checkers (in which kings also capture from a
distance) and was invented shortly after the Turks tried to conquer Vienna
in the 17th century (1683?). So it comes from south-eastern Germany (ooops,
this wasn't political correct either)...
