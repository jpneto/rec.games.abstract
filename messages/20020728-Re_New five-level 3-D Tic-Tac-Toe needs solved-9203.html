The center space in the variation that I'm working keying on is with the
center being a 'free-space' meaning that both players can use this space for
their win if desired.  It is configured before the game starts.

Another separate variation would be where the center space is still free but
one or two other positions are also set to be a free space with a neutral
colored marble.  My limited experience with this variation found that the
random free space was rapidly neutralized, whereas the center space
continued to be a significant factor.  This may be because 9 of the 21
planes intersect there.   Each plane has 12 possible winning combinations
times the 21 planes is 252 possible winning combinations for the system.  It
is interesting that I have only played a single draw in over 3 years of play
at all levels.  There seem to be so many permutations from each position
that even if a player concentrates on blocking every threat seems to
eventually loose.  I have played several chess master who portented this
point of view.  That is part of why I need help with this and both of you
guys should send me your mailing addesss: <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:jimlund@cts.com">jimlund@cts.com</a>

I appreciate the perspective that this variation could be making the game
between an odd and even configuration.  It may initially seem that five
levels allows too many points of defense, but it does not appear to be the
case.

Thanks,

I didn't understand 'free space' to mean 'off limits'.  I thought he meant
that it belonged to both players.  My understanding of Bingo is that the
center space is 'free', and you can complete a five-in-a-row through it by
marking just the other four in that row.
