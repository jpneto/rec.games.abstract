Thanks, Mark.  Not exactly what I'm looking for, but it does look like
an excellent game.

I've sometimes toyed with the notion of using dice as something other
than randomizers (in fact, years ago, I designed a wargame that used
them as units with built-in step reduction, much like what are now the
"Columbia block games").  Nice to see someone else has actually done
it.

Take a look at Cephalopod.  People have commented that it's Chess like,
even though it has nothing to do with Chess.  It's something about your
choices and how far you can look ahead, etc.  People concentrate on
their moves and take a long time.  It's like watching a Chess game.
I've also designed a couple of games which use a Checkers board, but
I'd recommend Cephalopod as the most natural fit.

All of my games are played at SuperDuperGames.org, and I always keep a
challenge open as MarkSteere, if you want to try any of them out.  My
latest, Scribe, is getting a very favorable reaction.
