Here's a geeklist I created some years ago:
 <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/2246/stacking-games">http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/2246/stacking-games</a>

It also includes Jenga, but apart from that, a nice collection of
(mainly abstract) stacking games.

Nice list, here are some additions:

1. Bashni.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/bashni.html">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/bashni.html</a>
2. Emergo.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/emergo.html">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/emergo.html</a>
Bashni is the original stacking game based on Shashki (Russian
Checkers). Lasker in turn used the idea to make Lasca, which is the
same principle applied to Anglo-American Checkers.
Emergo is not a track but a pit - it does away with an initial
position, direction and promotion and uses an entering procedure that
fits the mechanism like a glove.
Since I invented Emergo, I would like to ask you to to consult
Benedikt Rosenau about these two. He's a leading expert on Bashni, and
column checkers variants in general.

3. Crossfire.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/crossfire-525">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/crossfire-525</a>
Not all that important, basically 'hexfocus', but if you read the
rules you'll find a significant difference: In Focus the 'ceiling' is
a stack of 5. In Crossfire the ceiling of a stack equals the number of
adjacent cells of the cell it occupies. This has far reaching
strategical consequences, since large stacks can be aimed at 'low
capacity' cells, redering large captures and numbers of reserves. It
provides fixed targets in a notoriously 'fluid' mechanism.

4. Explocus.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/explocus-527">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/explocus-527</a>
Explocus was invented by dutch game designer Martin Medema. It is
probably the most capricious one of the bunch.

5. Breakthrough.
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/breakthrough-517">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/breakthrough-517</a>
A nice tactical race game based on an adaption of the 'explosion
mechanism' that also powers Explocus, and that in itself came from a
stacking game called 'Explosion' that was published in the English
"Games &amp; Puzzles" magazine somewhere in the early to mid seventies.
