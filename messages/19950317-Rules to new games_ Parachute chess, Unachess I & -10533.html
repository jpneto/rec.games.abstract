There is an article on Jeff Miller and his invention UNACHESS in this 
month's (March 1995) issue of 'Interview Magazine'. According to Jeff, 
the article is largely bogus -- most of what are supposed to be quotes
aren't quotes at all, but it's still a nice multipage article.

At this point we think that white may have an unbeatable game by opening
with the queen followed by the king (something like 1. Q*b2 or c3 followed 
by dropping the king to some safe place) -- if this is true then the game is
dead. Any thoughts?

Here are the rules to the game and some variants:

                       =================

                           UNACHESS
                   Invented by Jeff Miller 
                 with help from Edward Jackman
               all rights reserved by Jeff Miller
                    Official concise rules

 Same as standard orthochess except:

1. The board is initially empty and each player has the normal complement 
   of 16 pieces in reserve.
 
2. During a turn, a player must do one of three things: 
   a. place a piece from in hand on an empty square on the board 
   b. move a previously placed piece to an empty square 
   c. move a previously placed piece onto a square occupied by an 
      opposing piece, capturing it.
 
3. Pawns may be entered on the second, third or fourth rows only. 
   Pawns entered on the second row have the power of an initial 
   double move and may be captured en passant as in standard chess.
 
4. Castling is allowed if King and Rook are on traditional squares, 
   and all the normal conditions required for castling exist.
 
5. A player's King must be placed before being allowed to make any 
   capturing moves. A piece that controls the square that the enemy 
   King occupies does not check it until the friendly King is entered 
   onto the board. That is called 'quasi-check'. A player is under no 
   compulsion to move out of quasi-check, and may even move into 
   quasi-check. A player may legally move into quasi-check.
 

Variations played include:

1. No en-passant and castling. (<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Highly recommended<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, regardless 
   of what Jeff thinks!)
2. No initial double-step pawn moves.
3. Allow initial placement of pawns on the 1st through 4th ranks rather
   than 2nd through 4th ranks. This last variation has a big effect on 
   the game.

                       ====================
Here are some Unachess variants that came about after many player suggestions
that white had too large of an advantage and that the game was to 'sharp' --
once you were in trouble, odds are it's all over.
                       ---------------------
                            UNACHESS II
                    Invented by Edward Jackman
                  Based on Unachess by Jeff Miller

All the rules to UNACHESS apply with these important changes:

1. A dropped piece may NOT be placed so that it attacks the enemy king, 
   regardless of whether or not the friendly king is on the board yet,
   under ANY circumstances, even if it is the only way to escape mate.
 
2. Castling and en passant are not allowed.

This variation is much more forgiving of errors in the opening than standard 
Unachess and games are longer and more orthochessish. It is quite common for
the initiative to go back and forth many times -- as opposed to Unachess where
it is unlikely to change hands more than once, if at all.

Highly suggested variations:

  --&gt; No double-step pawn moves.
  --&gt; Pawns may be entered in rows 1-4.
 
                       ---------------------
                   PARACHUTE CHESS (UNACHESS III)
                    Invented by Edward Jackman
                  Based on Unachess by Jeff Miller

All the rules to UNACHESS II apply with these important changes:

1. A dropped piece may not be placed so that it attacks ANY enemy 
   piece under ANY circumstance.
 
The thinking behind this game is that if you are parachuting into a 
battle, you are helpless until you land. It is quite possible to have
be unable to enter a Queen legally later in the game and quite likely 
to be unable to enter any piece at all to specific squares. 

I can't say whether Unchess II or Parachute chess is the better game yet,
but so far I like Parachute chess best.

                       ---------------------
                            UNASHOGI
                    Invented by Edward Jackman
                  Based on Unachess by Jeff Miller


Same as standard Shogi except:.

1. The board is initially empty and each player has the normal complement 
   of 20 pieces in reserve.
 
2. During a turn, a player must do one of three things:  
   a. place a piece from the reserve on an empty square on the board  
   b. move a previously placed piece to an empty square  
   c. move a piece to a square occupied by an opposing  piece, capturing it.
 
3. A player may not make a capture until her/his own king is on the board.  
   Your pieces have no real power of check on the opposing king until 
   your own king is placed. Your opponent can legally place his or her 
   king right next to your promoted Rook if your king is still in hand. 
   There is no additional rule governing when you must enter your king. 
   If a piece is checking the opposing king, but the friendly king has 
   not been placed, that is called quasi-check. A player is under no 
   compulsion to move out of quasi-check.


Variations:

 --&gt; Pieces do not promote unless their king has been 
     placed. Strongly  recommended.
 --&gt; Pieces do not promote unless the enemy king has been placed.  
 --&gt; Pieces do not promote unless both kings are placed.

This last game is completely untested.

I'd be glad to here comments, suggestions, ideas.
