Uh... while I like this game :) it's not abstract,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What makes you say that? (What's your definition of "abstract"
in this context?)
It has no theme
It is a "perfect information" game (no hidden information)
It is entirely skill-based - no luck
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It's debatable;  but I claim it is a game of hidden information.

In chess, if I try to move N-KB3, I am pretty sure that the knight
will end up on KB3.  In crokinole it is hard to predict exactly
where the pieces will end up, at least for a beginner.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I wouldn't call that hidden information - I would call it
un(der)developed skill.
In chess, a beginner might anticipate moving a piece, touch it and
move it there, realize it may be an error, and adjust the move before &gt;

Well, we can start including football and the like into abstract games
as well in that case
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why?  Football definitely involves hidden information - a play book and
codes.  Football also relies more heavily on physical skills (agility,
particularly) than on mental skills.

consider it abstract).

I don't either, but I'm reconsidering golf.  ;-)

With chess and go and the like you can abstract
out the relevant features of the game (where, e.g. the shape and feel of
the knight is not espeically relevant) and move it to another medium.
People have being playing chess via mail for a while now (and these days
over e-mail or RT over the internet). I have seen Real Chess Players who
play in their heads, just announcing the moves to each other with no
board (and THAT really floors me)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've heard of Crokinole being played by mail &amp; via airwaves (radio) as well.
Features of the game can also vary greatly, as in chess or draughts.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Of course you can object that chess and go are not completely medium
independant, since being unable to read physical queues from your
opponent when playing over the internet, for example, changes the game.
When compared to the differences between say football and foosball,
though, these are fairly trivial.

A lot of arguments have been made that abstract games can contain <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>no<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
physical skill, which is (IMHO) a bit ludicrous.  Pieces must be moved
correctly, and that requires some degree of dexterity/hand-eye coordination.
Mistakes can cause setbacks or even losses.  A better case (IMO) would be
that in abstract games, mental skills should predominate over physical
skills, which applies to Crokinole.

Arguments have also been made that an abstract game should be able to be
played by someone who directs another (or a machine) on where to place a
piece (reducing the reliance on dexterity in order to play the game).  This
can also apply to Crokinole.  I have personally "coached" many novice
players through a game, never touching a disc, but describing to the novice
where to shoot, what to aim for, how much force to use, etc., which often
results in that person/team winning the game.

The real skill in Crokinole is not in the hand-eye coordination of being
able to fillip a disc accurately (execute a shot,) but in being able to
"see" potential shots, weigh their risks/rewards, avoid pitfalls, use the
board and your opponents' weaknesses to your advantage, etc., etc.

I can teach most people to be able to flick a disc competently in about a
half hour or less.  It takes <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>much<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> longer to teach them how to look for,
see, and analyze positions &amp; shots on the board.
