We could look at this idea of 'perfection' in abstract games as a form of
mathematical elegance, or we could look at it in terms of real-world
values such as ease of play, ease of learning, simplicity of manufacture,
physical beauty of the game, etc. ...[]...

i think when it comes to this notion of defects in abstract games, we
should stick to abstract defects.  the real-world values are important,
although your "ease of play" and "ease of learning" kind of stray back
into the abstract realm.  if we think of Occam's Razor coming into the
picture, it might be that mathematical elegance and ease of play/learning
are linked.

Would Chess be 'improved' by eliminating draws?  Would Go be 'improved'
by adding them?  What makes these two cases so different?

in my opinion, you have hit upon what i think is the most undesirable
aspect of chess.  the huge number of drawn games in proportion to the
decisions is tiresome at best.  it is, however, a nasty problem to fix.
so nasty it might be better off left alone.  in the recent fischer-
spassky match, with the new fischer clock in place and with fischer
known to hate draws, there were still 15 out of 30 games drawn - and
that is a lower ratio...one of those karpov-kasparov matches had a
huge number of draws due to the change fischer brought about by not
having draws count for 1/2 points anymore.  it is the smallness of the
board and the limitations on the piece's movements that creates a
balance of power that makes it easier to defend, relatively, than to
kill.  thus to reduce the draws, the game would need drastic alterations
that may make it unrecognizable to its former incarnation.

go would not be improved by a whole integer komi or perpetual check
draw, again, in my opinion.  hey, this is another thing basketball
has over hockey.  i just dont like draws in general.  others may
disagree.
