<br>&nbsp;sounds interesting.&nbsp; by my count there are 22 pentahexominoes, making
<br>&nbsp;for a covered area of 110 hexes.&nbsp; the order-7 board is 127 hexes big,
<br>&nbsp;leaving a gap of 17 hexes, and the order-6 board is 91, which may be
<br>&nbsp;playeable.&nbsp; or you have a non-hexagonal overall shape.&nbsp; a 7-6-7-6-7-6
<br>&nbsp;sided near-hexagon uses 110 hexagons, for example.

<br>&nbsp;a couple of years ago, as a way of getting into java programming, i
<br>&nbsp;coded up some versions of a game i invented.&nbsp; this game uses a grid
<br>&nbsp;of hexagons.&nbsp; however, instead of attaching hexagons together into
<br>&nbsp;hexominoes, i used the sides of the hexagons.&nbsp; then the game was
<br>&nbsp;changed into fencing off hexagons with these stick-like wirey pieces
<br>&nbsp;i eventually called xoids, because i found myself nicknaming them
<br>&nbsp;after animals and other such things.&nbsp; the game itself i called Xong.
<br>&nbsp;i couldnt get server space or have something running 24/7 on some
<br>&nbsp;machine out there, so i never got to the good java stuff.&nbsp; but i did
<br>&nbsp;put it out on the web:

<br>&nbsp;alas, i fear i am not so good a writer and some of the material
<br>&nbsp;there may be a little hard to grok at first.&nbsp; i am trying to redo
<br>&nbsp;it in a more accessible manner, but there have been distractions....

<br>&nbsp;here is the first section in the Rules page:
<br>
<br>Introduction &amp; Historical Background
<br>
<br>Xong is a two-player abstract game invented by Nathan A. Smith in 1996, 
evolved from another game he invented in 1982, QuintHex.&nbsp; QuintHex was the 
first game to employ the placement of pieces made of hexagon legs to surround 
hexagons for territory points. It used dual sets of the 12 quintastix, made by 
joining 5 legs together, one set for each color.&nbsp; It suffered from the most 
common abstract game problem: the first player has an advantage.&nbsp; A 
single-legged piece was given to the 2nd player to use as a means of evening 
up the game.&nbsp; In the usenet group, rec.games.abstract, often this problem 
could crop up.&nbsp; Discussion would then frequently veer into such things as 
Progressive Chess. Progressive Chess is a fairy chess game that addresses this 
problem by giving each player at turn N a gradually increasing number of 
simultaneous moves equal to N.&nbsp; Xong took this idea, along with a familiar 
peculiarity of the sport of Baseball, and thus came into existence as a 
candidate for a solution of the first player problem.&nbsp; The Baseball 
peculiarity is the observation that, among the major sporting games, it is the 
only one to have each play begin with the ball in the hands of the defense. 
Xong employs the same idea, for without this concept, Xong would not work in 
bringing out the progressive nature of each move.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;so xong starts out with the smallest pieces and gradually increases
<br>&nbsp;them in size until there is no more room on the board.
