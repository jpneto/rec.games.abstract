I just got (a couple of hours ago) Berlekamp's book on Dots and Boxes,
so I should have up to date stuff on that part of the book.

There's definitely more on Dots and Boxes in the new book (The
Dots-and-Boxes Game: Sophisticated Child's Play) than in the 1st edition
of Winning Ways.  I don't know how much of that will be incorporated
into the 2nd edition, but since that's in volume 3, I think it won't be
out for a while.

Elwyn was at the Stanford Bookstore yesterday promoting the new book.
He was playing simultaneous Dots and Boxes against all comers, and
offering a $50 prize for anyone who could score 11 points against him on
a 5x5 board.  He had to pay off twice, so I think he might raise the
threshold to 12 on future demos.  (He said he's going to southern
California next week, I think USC and UCSD.)  My wife scored 11, with a
little help from me.  (OK, a lot, but she did make the first 10 or so
moves on her own.)
