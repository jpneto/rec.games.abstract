Interesting mechanism.  I remember seeing that in Hexplode, though I don't
know where the mechanism first appeared.

Thanks, I never heard of that one.

In 1979 I ordered back issues of Games &amp; Puzzles Magazine and one of
them (they started 1972) featured a game called Explosion, with this
mechanism on a square board, so it appeared first say mid-seventies.
Something was wrong with it, but the
mechanism stuck.

Hexplode is said to be of 1982. That's about the same time Martin
Medema came with Explocus, soon followed by my Breakthrough, because
I
felt he had been trespassing in my territory :)

Later Martin devised (I can think of no other word) the monumental
and
crooked Atlantis, fortunately misdirecting a great idea. It allowed
me
to whisper out Mu, my most epic game, that is still waiting (without
complaining by the way, it has become very used to waiting ;) for a
far from easy applet implementation.

So there's more to it than meets wiki.
