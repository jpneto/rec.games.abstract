    While this isn't exactly in the spirit of this post...
    Why not have the world's fastest dragster (or rocket sled or whatever)
    compete in the 100 meter dash in the Olympics? Why not have an hydraulic
    lift compete in weightlifting competition? Chess is a sport - not
    a (pure) measure of intelligence (whatever "intelligence" is).

There is a qualitive difference between physical exploits like racing and

     I don't think racing is a purely physical exploit...neither do I think
     chess is purely mental. Is calculation one of the higher things we do
     mentally? I don't know.

Man is used to getting beat in the physical realm.  Horses and dogs have
outrun the fastest humans since time immemorial, so watching a dragster
do it is no big deal.  But chess involves brainpower, and in matters
of mind, humans have been largely unrivalled until recently.

     It will still be the case when computers beat all humans at chess,
     won't it? Computers out-calculate humans. They have out-calculated
     humans for many years now in areas of mathematics. If there is
     a single mathematician who thinks a computer is more intelligent than
     he because it can calculate an integral faster, I've yet to meet him.
     Mathematics is not generally considered a physical exploit.

So human-computer chess matches will maintain a John Henry-esque type
interest for some time to come.

     I agree, they will. But not because we haven't been beat in matters
     of the brain.

     Anyway, I can see I confused some people with my post...I know some
     people are interested in it - that alone justifies doing it. The
     question is: Does it justify calling it a "World Championship?" I happen
     to think not.
