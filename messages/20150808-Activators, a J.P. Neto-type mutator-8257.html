The concept of activators has been around a long time in wargames, where they are generally called "leaders" and "supply units". Their purpose is simple. They affect the units around them, allowing those units to move, to build, to fight, to capture... Two key features of these pieces are 1) they are short range in their effects, and 2} they are game pieces that move and interact with the other pieces in the game. 

The purpose of activators is to take some control of the game away from the players and put that control on the board. Activators impose a structure on an abstract that otherwise wouldn't be there without complex and convoluted rules. 

Activators may be defined by a few numbers. The range is how far away an activator can affect a piece. The value is how many pieces an activator can affect in a turn. After these 2 numbers, activators can be customized for the specific game being played. One activator may increase movement but prevent that piece from capturing, for example. Another might decrease movement but allow stronger captures. 

That's the idea in a nutshell. Clearly it can be used with chess, checkers/draughts, stacking games, connection games and other types. Enjoy!
