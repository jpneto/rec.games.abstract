Thanks for stoppin' in, megamau.

Considering all the features at bgg ag (pictures, game links, designer links, spoiler alerts, etc., etc., etc.), and the masses of bgg members, the "volume" you speak of is barely a trickle!  There are 1 and 2 day gaps all over the place, including the past two days, and gaps of a week or more on every page.  What discussion there is is inane, such as Nestor promoting his plagiarized bad games and stuffing contests with them.  Ever considider limiting publishers to 1 game each?  omg!  This is your idea of "significant discussion??" 

You really should listen to Mo.  He's got more creativity than the rest of the bgg ag forum rats (including Christian Freeling) put together.  His advice won't be sugar coated, but if you want sugar coating, eat frosted flakes.  If you want to actually learn something about abstract game design, open your ears and close your cake holes. 

Christian Freeling checks for new posts in bgg ag every 1/2 hour, judging from his response times.  Every post is an opportunity for him to commandeer the discussion and divert it to the only topic that interests him.  Himself.  

Forum rat: "Crappy weather in St. Luis today."
Christian Freeling: "Oh that reminds me!  Me me me me me!!!!"

Christian is such an extreme snot, he's incapable of actually "discussing" anything.  Other than himself, that is.  The thing I don't understand is WHY??  He's had 95 years to come up with something original, yet his games are almost entirely variants.  But he still considers himself to be above it all.  Major Hillary Clinton syndrome. 

"Maybe you were wrong," megamau? lol  Is it really that hard for you to admit your mistakes?  ms_designer says he isn't Mo, and from what I can see there's no reason to doubt it.  The irony is palpable. You've discounted the one guy who is capable and willing to help you (Mo) to such an extent that anyone who agrees with him must be his "sockpuppet."  Wise up!!
