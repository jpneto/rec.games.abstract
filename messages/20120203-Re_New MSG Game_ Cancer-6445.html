Woohoo, glad to see a new Mark Steere game. The concept intrigues and
the name is delightfully terrible.

As with most cycling games, it's hard for me to anticipate how it will
go in actual play, and I take it that you don't have much of an idea
either.

But one issue that I'm guessing will be central is: how much of a
stone-advantage on board does one player need before his win becomes
inevitable? If he doesn't need much of an advantage, then the game
could be decided in the first capture or two, which would mean that
the rest of the game, all the cycling, would be pointless. That would
be a drag. Any thoughts as to whether that would be the case? I pose
this question to everybody, since I'm guessing the question probably
qualifies as too Plebian for you (Mark) to bother with.
