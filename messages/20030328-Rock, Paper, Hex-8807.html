Yesterday I thought up a new hex variant, that I thought might be of
interest, even though it isn't quite a game of perfect information.
Actually, I doubt I'm the first to come up with this idea wrt Hex, and it
could be (and sometimes has been) applied to many abstract games.

The idea is to have simultaneous movement, rather than the swap rule. Each
player secretly indicated their intended hex, and then the intentions are
revealed. If each player chooses the same hex, then the process is repeated
except that the originally intended hex of off-limits until the next time
pieces are successfully placed (sort of like in Diplomacy).

One thing to note, is that while the concept is somewhat applicable to
almost any game, in most of them (I suspect) it would lead to frequent
simultaneous wins for each side. (Imagine checkmate being delivered to each
king in chess.) In Hex that can't happen, though it could lead to draws if
all remaining hexes have placed off-limits so that no moves are possible.

I'm not a very good Hex player, so I don't think I should be the one to test
this. But I'd be happy to referee, receiving the secret moves and reporting
them when I've received them from both players. I suggest an even-hexed
board, so as to reduce the chance of first-turn deadlocks. If anyone is
interested in playing, please reply on- or off-line.
