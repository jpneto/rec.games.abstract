                Chessling - A New Board Game.
                ----------------------------

Rules for playing Chessling.

1) Use the same board and pieces as for International 
   Chess (also known as English Chess or Western Chess).

2) Start with an empty board.

3) One side starts first on any square, after which play continues 
   in turn.  A player cannot pass his turn.

4) A legal move consists of one of the following:

   - placing one's own piece on an unoccupied square.  The color of the
     square is immaterial.

   - moving a piece as per the International Chess rules with the exception
     of pawns.  A pawn piece moves and captures like a King piece, 
     that is one step in any direction.  No promotion when a pawn reaches 
     an edge of the board.

   - capturing an opponent's piece by moving one's own piece to that square.

5) The side who first captures all the opponent's pieces wins the game.
   If neither side can capture all the other side's pieces, and both sides
   agree to a draw then it is a draw.

6) Other possible variations: The size of the board, the number or types of
   pieces can be different from the International Chess set.  To play
   handicap games, players can take unequal number of pieces or can start 
   with initial placement of pieces such as pawns.

Notes:
-----
1) Playing on a bigger size board will, in general, lead to a more 
   interesting game.

2) Some of the strategies and tactics for this game are:
   "play inside", "play outside", "direction of play", "inducing", 
   "preparation", "retain initiative", "lose initiative", "speedy development", 
   "slow development", "wait and see", "global", "local",
   "area of influence", "linking", "thickness", "light", "heavy", 
   "enciclement", "breaking out of encirclement",  "exchange", "sacrifice".
