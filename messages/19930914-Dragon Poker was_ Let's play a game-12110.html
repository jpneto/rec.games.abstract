Other examples of this sort of game:  TEGWAR - "The Exciting Game
WIthout Any Rules" (objective: To convince bystanders that it IS a real
game); something from a star trek episode; the poker varient in Robert
Asprin's Myth Series; and many more I'm sure.

  Dragon Poker(the poker varient in Robert Asprin's Myth Series) does NOT belong
in a list of games which involve 'making it up'(for lack of a better phrase) as
you go along.  You don't add rules to Dragon Poker, and you don't break them.
Nor do you add conditionals, as all of the conditional modifiers are spelled out
quite plainly in a copy of the rules for your dimension.  Dragon Poker is billed
as the most complex game in existance because it is almost impossible to know
all the conditional modifiers in effect in one game, as they are based on #,
,sex, race/genus/etc, etc of players.  Location of players, game, planet, etc.
Day, week, month, hour, etc...  Well, you get the idea.  Unfortunately, Asprin
never included a complete list of conditional modifiers for this(or any other)
dimension...

  And for Calvinball, I don't remember anywhere in the strip where Calvin or
Hobbes flat-out contradicted a previous rule or where one gave two consecutive
rules.  Seems like they would be rules(probably unspoken because they are well-
known)to the game, otherwise it wouldn't really be playable.  Also, they never
set a condition which makes themselves automatically the victor that I know of.
  As for playing the same game twice? Why would that situation occur?  Surely
the loser of the last time the game was played that way would do something
different, even though all games probably start similarly.

  Hmm, something from a star trek show?  3-D chess(from the show) has official
rules, I just can't remember the publication(although the rules were a little
vague on a couple of points)

  As for the Let's play a game thread, I must say I feel the entire thread
was decimated when non-color players began making moves before non-color players
were allowed by a present player.  Sort of the feeling you get when you play a
game of Mornington Crescent and the opponent says Mornington Crescent for their
first turn, and does it for several games.
