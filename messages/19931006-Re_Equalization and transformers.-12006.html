Another is the "progressive" multi-mover, 1-2-3-4-5-.... , which has even
been played in tournaments, for progressive chess; (by the way, did the
e-mail progressive chess tournament ever finish in good order? - last I heard
was about March 1993, only some partial results.)

I haven't played progressive chess in years, and I always played it in
real-time with people who'd get annoyed when I spent 15 minutes trying to
find an N-move win.  Postal progressive chess would reduce that problem.

The trouble with the 1-2-2-2-2-...  multimove transformer, is that
(ii) it doesn't necessarily remove the first-move advantage, though it usually
    reduces it a lot, (though may somewhat <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>reverse<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it).

I thought it made a pretty good equalizer in practice; seems to me that the
resulting game will favor the second player about as often as the first.
Consider 1-2-2-... multimove Hex on a size-n board.  Who wins under perfect
play?  (I once conjectured that it was player 1 for odd n and player 2 for
even n, but this turned out to be wrong.)

Simplified go-moku (symmetric rules; no restrictions on forks or overruns;
infinite board; winning position is n stones in a row) is a first-player win
for n=5, and a draw for n=7 (I don't think n=6 has been solved yet).  What
is known about 1-2-2-... multimove go-moku for various values of n?
