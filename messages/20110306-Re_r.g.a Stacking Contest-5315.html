Me too.  Entering a popularity contest using my game as collateral wouldn't

Ok, fine.  Stop endlessly campaigning for publicly voted future contests
then.   "Expert" in this case means the judges know the contest parameters
and they have to read the rule sheets and actually play the games before
voting on them, a lot better than we could expect from an ignorant public..

I don't! lol  I've already made it clear that I believe Dieter's game will
be the best and will probably win.  You'd kill everyone in a publicly voted
popularity contest though, Christian, regardless of the relative qualities
of the entries.

Btw, all of this is rehash.  Both me and Dieter registered our objections to
a publicly voted popularity contest and the consensus was that we'd use
judges.  There hasn't been any new evidence to indicate that future contests
should now be publicly voted.  Alex picking through parts of months old
discussion and reiterating worn out arguments in favor of public voting
doesn't constitute new evidence.

In all seriousness, if you want to have a publicly voted abstract game
contest, do it at bgg.  They're already set up for it with an abstract games
forum, polling capability and tons of public to take the polls.  Why the big
agenda to turn rec.games.abstract into a half-assed bgg Jr.?

what fun. ;-)

my my my.  Hey, just have the games submitted anonymously - none of
the judges know who created it.  someone like Daniel receives them
from each of the competitors and assigns them a number in order of
email arrival.  he could then forward the bare rules without names to
someone like Greg to implement the human vs. human interface at a
website for the judges.  Once the entry date passes, then Greg is
allowed time to implement them and announces at that point that the
judging can begin.  the judging team of 3 could be like jury duty,
where they are randomly drawn from people who post here.  or
something.  they will be assigned randomly to be Judge A, Judge B,
Judge C.  each game would need to be played by all possible pairings,
going first and going last, with the 3rd judge able to sit in and
kibbitz in the comment panel along with the active players, the panel
will list them only as First, Last, Viewer.  this is at least 6 games
played of each entry.  we want to shake these games out as much as
possible.  so, if a trivial "cook" is discovered, so be it.  at least
a second round of 6 more judging games should be played for the
winners that survive.  perhaps a 3rd round of 6 each for the 2
finalists.

the names of the games will be initially, for the duration of the
contest, be simply: Game 1, Game 2, Game 3, . . .

the judges send anonymous voting tallies back to the Receiver who adds
them all up.  This makes it a double blind test.  no judge know who
made each game and no designer knows how any judge voted.  The
Receiver is the only one who must be a trustworthy person we can all
agree on.

once the contest is over and the winner &amp; runner ups are announced,
the authors come forward with their cool names for their games.  in
addition, the results of the judged games will also be published along
with their in-game panel commentary (First, Last, Viewer or F, L, V).

maybe the top 3 finishers become next years judges?  Miss America
indeed!

The Receiver and the 3 Judges should not have an entry in the current
contest.
