Anyone for a game of E-mail Hnefatafl, or Hafntafl (damned if I know how to 
spell it)?  Anyway, it's that Viking game where one side tries to get the king
out to the side of the board and the other side tries to capture the king.
Here are the rules the way I learned 'em:

2) Black has first move.  Black's object is to move its king to any square on 
the edge of the board.  White's object is to capture the king by surrounding
it on four sides, ie O
	       	     OKO
	   	      O
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

According to the way I learned, the situation:
    OO
   OXKO
    OO
is also a legal "checkmate".  This can obviously be extended to "surrounding
the king and any of his pieces completely (orthogonally) with no intervening 
spaces", although for the king to have more than one "neighbor" in the
endgame is rare.

4) Pieces capture by surrounding other pieces on any two sides (except diagonal
of course.)  Capturing is an <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>active<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> process, ie, a piece may move between two
of its opponent's pieces and not be captured.

It should be pointed out that multiple captures are perfectly legal.

Legal capture:

  ABCDEF			  ABCDEF
0 ...O..			0 ...O..
1 ...X..			1 ......
2 .OX.XO			2 .O.O.O
3 ......			3 ......
4 ...O..			4 ......

5) The space where the king is first placed (dead center of the board) is
called the THRONE and designated by a T after the king moves from it.  Consider
it to be an immobile "neutral" piece.  No piece <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>except<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the king may move 
through it.  Captures may be made by any side against it, eg:

I learned a different version of this (though I haven't got the rules handy
and may be misremembering)  No other piece could <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>land<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> on the throne, but
moving through was perfectly legal.  I also have conflicting memories about
whether using the throne to capture was actually in this game or in one of
its relatives, Tablut or Alea Evangeli.

If you have a good source for SCA books, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Medieval_Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> by Salamallah the
