<br><blockquote type=cite>Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>I'm looking for an Internet games research or theory newsgroup/"community". The point would be to discuss 
mathematical/computational properties of existing games, proposals for new games (and their properties), game models and 
formalisms, academic aspects of enjoyement (what makes a good game? why do people play games, etc.), how computers can 
contribute to research in games (note: this is different than talking ABOUT computer games!), computational rationale, 
communication/collabaration in mult-player games, etc. etc.
<br>
<br>I'd like for it to be a discussion group.. not a serious of web pages containing information that I can easily look up 
on Google. I think interest in the subject is most definitely growing worldwide, and I'd like to meet new people 
interested in this.
<br>
<br>If not, would there be anyone interested in helping create a group like this (ie. start by telling me how to do this) ?

<br>
<br>It is pretty unlikely that you would get a positive vote for a (big 8) group
<br>like this out of the blue. What you want to do is try to get some dicscussion
<br>going in related groups (possibly rec.games.board or rec.games.abstract)
<br>and if enough traffic seems to warrant a separate group then start trying
<br>to get one created. You could create and alt group, but they don't get
<br>as good of propagation as big 8 groups.
<br>
<br>You probably would find some interest in these topics in rec.games.board.
<br>Many of the specific topics you have mentioned have been discussed there
<br>in the past.
<br>
<br>I am trying to move this discussion there (followups set) as you are more
<br>likely to see interest there than here.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I'm cross-posting to rec.games.abstract again. The reason for this being that I'm not only interested in board games. 
I'm also interested in other types of games such as role-playing, abstract games, and even continous state-space games 
like real-time strategy.
<br>
<br>Thanks for the pointer. I'll try to keep checking r.g.board regularly. But please explain me something.. what's a "big 
8" group? Also, you'd be surprised how many people are interested in games research/theory... worldwide. The university 
of Alberta, for instance, has a research group solely concentrated on games: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~games</a>. The IGDA 
has spawned an "academia" section, and there have been many books (eg. "Games of No Chance", "Simple Games", "More Games 
of No Chance", etc.) written on these subjects.
