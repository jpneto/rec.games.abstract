As far as Luis' Konobi goes, I think the Zillions implementation might
benefit from the following:  if you right click, all your legal moves
are highlighted.  My guess is after Konobi is played a number of
times, this really won't be needed.  But at first I think it would be
very helpful, the reason being the surprising restrictiveness I noted
before.

Steve, that's already a standard feature of the Zillions program. You just have to right click on the board and select Show &gt; Movable. It works for any Zillions game, not just Konobi.

As for the game itself, I agree that it's more restrictive than any other connection game. That's the distinctive feature of Konobi, and hopefully not a bad one.

A direct consequence of the diagonal placement restriction is that you can often take advantage of enemy stones to make unbreakable virtual connections among your own stones. In fact, bridges don't really work otherwise, so you must often be careful not to make a move which helps your opponent more than yourself. There seem to be some really subtle strategic considerations involved in such decisions. And then there's the drama of realizing that a stone you placed ten moves ago has now triggered a powerful ladder from your opponent...
