hello anyone,

  as there is some talk about Chinese Chess (Xianqi), I wonder, whether there
are still more Chess variants - I only know Shogi and Xianqi as real chess 
variants, but I recently heard about "Korean Chess" - does such a variant truly 
exist or is it only another style of playing Chess (or Xianqi, Shogi) itself?

Also - I once asked for a rules on Xianqi, I got some, but there was no 
description of the move notation for the game. I now saw some games postings 
with a form of notation, that I seemingly didn't quite understand - perhabs 
someone can mail me another rules text that includes a description of the 
notation. (Currently I play Xianqi with a guy in "Vervan's Gaming Network" 
newsgroup V_CHESS and we use the common chess notation to exchange our moves. 
But - if these aren't the right form of notation, we want to switch over to the 
right ones then (just to learn a bit more about Xianqi).

yours,

       Benedikt
