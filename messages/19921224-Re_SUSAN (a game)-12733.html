 careful; if one of your stones is surrounded on your own turn

could you say that this is the reverse of Go?  in Go you kill first,
then breath, as for example in a ko.  so in SUSAN you try to breath
first, then kill.  thus, if you cant breath, you die before you kill?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Yes, exactly. A nice consequence of this is that it is possible to
protect a stone by threatening an <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>empty<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> neighbor.

disallow repeated positions...the 4-6 consecutive slides idea just
sounds messy.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Abstractly I agree, disallowing repeat positions is more elegant. My
concern is that keeping track of repeat positions might be hard for many
people. On the other hand, the no passing rule would be a direct result
of the no repeats rule, so it is very elegant.

nice game.  how did you come up with SUSAN?  is it an
acronym?  the end of a bad relationship?  :-)

Here's the true story that I put on the tag for the game (I guess I aught
to point out that this is Copyright (c) 1991 by Stephen Linhart - All
Rights Reserved):
 
  "So why call a board game SUSAN?"
 
  Well, I'll tell you. One day me and my friend Michael were eating at
  our favorite cafe. We were playing my new game and I asked him what he
  thought it should be called. Just then, the waitress came over and
  Michael asked her name. She said 'Susan', and he turned to me and said
  'Susan'. So I said 'Ah... Susan'. Anyway, the name stuck, and it must
  be a good one because everybody asks "So why call a board game SUSAN?"
 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
...if i tell somebody else about this game and we play
it on one my hexgrid boards (i seem to have all these remnants of games
lying around from failed ideas), is that ok?  as long as i dont make
any money or let anyone else make money off this?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In this case, I'm already distributing SUSAN(tm) for the Mac as Freeware,
so I not only don't mind people playing SUSAN on their own homemade sets,
I would really like it. Of course, commercial distribution would be
another thing altogether. In addition to copyright on the words and
images, and trademark on the name, I've heard a legal theory that it may
be possible to protect a boardgame using a 'look and fell' copyright
argument similar to what has been done with some computer software.

what do others in this group think about some kind of Registration?
we could establish an archive somewhere for Registered games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think this sounds like a great idea. Really it could be a game archive
first and foremost, and additionally it could be dated for copyright
purposes.
