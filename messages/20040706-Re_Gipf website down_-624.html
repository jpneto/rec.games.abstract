cause your daytime is nighttime up here. That's the only explanation I can
think of.

Any way this is a great time to ask you a few things about GIPF.
How long have you played GIPF?
What to you was/were the main threshold(s) when starting out with GIPF?

To anyone reading this I am asking because I am starting a a GIPF club.

John,

Yes, the Gipf website began functioning for me two days after I posted.
During that time I saw posts elsewhere of some people not being able to get
to it, and others who could. You may be right. It may have been some sort of
upgrade going on intermittently over the course of a couple of days.

I've been playing Gipf since January 2002. I don't play often; maybe 3 or 4
times a year. Few people I know care all that much about abstract games.
I'm not sure what you mean by "my main thresholds when starting out with
GIPF".

Good luck with your club.
