Twixt is still available from the Kosmos game company. In the U.S. we
can get it through Funagain Games at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/05145?o2W2KMFm;;17">http://kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/05145?o2W2KMFm;;17</a>
It might be available in shops in the U.K.
Decent used sets are also available, at eBay.

Kadon sells all sorts of abstract games:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gamepuzzles.com/">http://gamepuzzles.com/</a>
My favorites there are Kaliko and Y.

Trax is available at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.traxgame.com/">http://www.traxgame.com/</a>

Octi is rapidly growing in popularity; <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi.net/">http://www.octi.net/</a>

If I knew of a company currently selling Hex sets, I'd tell you.
Ed Collins has a nice set on auction:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1726070421">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1726070421</a>
The COMPONENTS of a Hex game are available; Chessex sells Battlemats
at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://chessex.com/mats/Battlemats_&amp;_Megamats.htm">http://chessex.com/mats/Battlemats_&amp;_Megamats.htm</a>
The 1" hexes Battlemats can be cut into 15x15 rhombuses, and
are the right size for full-size Go stones. With a sewing machine,
you could zigzag-stitch the edges with black &amp; white thread, which
would also eliminate any future fraying.
