<div class="moz-text-flowed">Many Thanks. I do agree that they have all a very different gameplay.
<br>
<br>The last url is great (I knew the other ones), it's interresting to see 
that there is a "family" of abstract tower games.

<br>These games are not all that similar in play.

<br>Game of strategy for two players, by Bruno Faidutti
<br>Rules of the game :
<br>Place the 12 discs flat on the table between the two players. Before you are
<br>now 12 stacks of discs, with each stack being a single disc tall.
<br>Each player takes a turn by taking an entire stack and placing it on top of
<br>another stack sharing a common characteristic.
<br>There are 2 characteristics:
<br>a) The two stacks are the same height.
<br>b) The two stacks are both topped with the same color disc.
<br>A player must move the entire stack-dividing a stack is not allowed. The
<br>game ends when one player has no legal move. That player loses.
