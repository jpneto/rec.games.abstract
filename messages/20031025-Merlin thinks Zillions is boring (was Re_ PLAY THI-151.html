Ok, that explain's Merlin's comments.  I have ZERO interest in his
game now (not even for free) because of the posting behavior.  I was
wondering why he was saying what he did.  He confused me with
Dewsbury.

  NO I did not confuse you with anyone else, Richard hutnik, your
zillions game is absalutly boring and thats why your trying to insult
my game you do not like competition, and your showing it with you
postings.

My gosh Merlin, this must be the ONLY post you are able to respond to.

So, you don't like: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com">http://www.zillionsofgames.com</a>.

Well, bubby, I can understand that.  Zillions isn't for everyone.  You
really have to like abstract strategy games to like it.  It isn't my
game.  I just like it and had made mention of it.  I had done up
several of my games in it.  And, if you don't like it, so be it.

Wow, you keep trying to guess why I say bad things about cropcircles? 
I seriously doubt it is any form of competition for an abstract
strategy game computer engine that plays everything from chess, to
backgammon to freecell.  For one thing, it doesn't make claims to have
healing powers.

Thank you for giving me a reason to mention a groundbreaking abstract
strategy gaming engine once more.

By the way, it is ABSOLUTELY.  You keep mispelling the word.
