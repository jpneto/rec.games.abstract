|&gt; Sometime in the mid-80's I heared of a game in which the players made the
|&gt; rules as the game progressed and the winner was the player who had to win
|&gt; by logical nessesity before the game even started.  Has anyone ever heared of
|&gt; this or any other game of its like?

You're not thinking of Nomic are you? The legal moves in Nomic, at least
according to the initial rules, are (roughly) to change the rules. The
winner according to the initial rules is the first player to accumulate
a certain number of points, but that's liable to change as the game
progresses.
