Two questions/challenges:


  1&gt; Sprouts on surfaces of higher genus.  Can anyone even figure
out the 2 spot game on the general n-holed torus?  I haven't thought
too much about this, but naively there are infinitely many moves at
each stage.


  2&gt;  Go with passing.  Awhile ago a go variant was discussed on
r.g.go  where a legal move was to pass and store up the move for
later use.  If you have 3 moves stored up then on your turn you can
make up to 4 moves in a row (all of which must be legal ... 2 eyes
is still enough).  How large must the board be before passing is the
correct first move?

We are faced with the very real possibility that "digital" and 
"manual" will be used as antonyms.
