Actually, my comment was meant more constructively than it

So far, there's been no negative correlation between my bad behavior and the
popularity of my games.  There might even be a positive relationship between
the two.  For clothing designers, behavior matters a lot more.  If you get
drunk and have a public, Nazi rant, you could find yourself out of a job. 
But with clothing, who the designer is matters.  At the Oscars, it's "Who
are you wearing??", "Who are you wearing??"  I.e., Who designed your outfit?
 In abstract games, by contrast, it's "You're the designer??  Who gives a
fuck??"

Oddly there's a tendency for designers, including me, to take the public
reaction to their new games personally.  When you're convinced that your
game is amazingly good, but the public doesn't like it, it's a conspiracy. 
It happens to all designers.  We get pissed when we get dissed.  An episode
can last for weeks.  Or in Christian's case, for years.

Positive reviews are also taken unduly personally.  When an individual lives
and breathes one of your games and advances the strategy, you assume that
they admire you and that they'd probably enjoy playing your other games as
well.  In my case at least, no.  If you love one of my games, you won't
necessarily like me.  And you almost certainly won't like any of my other
games, which is not real surprising when you consider that I try to make my
games different from one another.  Yes, I have a bunch of stone placement
annihilation games and connection games, but given that...

I don't have animosity toward Christian.  I've reacted to the holy grail
claims and the forum stuffing.  Christian hasn't stuffed L19... yet.  He has
stuffed the Arimaa forum.  Christian's thread there dwarfs the whole rest of
the forum.

Christian and I have each tried to retire from game design on a number of
occasions.  In my case, I've given up trying.  All I can hope for is
vacations.  Long vacations.

PS On a constructive Redstone note, having now played a
couple of games at what I suspect is a reasonably competent
level, can I strongly recommend a 15x15 board as the default
size
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Thanks for the info.  Redstone, like Go, is highly scalable.  But the
character of the gameplay does change with each size change.  Expertise
matters.  A 7x7x7 is always used for Oust, but at some point in our
strategic development, we'll have to jump up to the 8x8x8.  The 8x8x8 will
last me a lifetime, but I could imagine others' expertise increasing the
board size a tad further.

19x19 I think will turn out to be too big for the changes it makes
over Go.

I don't understand that.

Also, the pie rule I still think is an excellent idea, but could I
recommend that it's a 4 move pie rule to force an assessment
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ultimately a sophisticated balancing mechanism may be recommended for
Redstone.  Starting out though, since almost nothing is known about Redstone
relative to Go, let's use something as simple as pie - or simpler.  Just
insist that Black make his first move at (2,2), and take it from there.
