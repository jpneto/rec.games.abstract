It's assumed that in 2-player games of perfect information, there is no element of luck.  But is this true? We can all agree that from a purely mathematical standpoint, there is no luck whatsoever.  But is there another kind of luck involved in the game?

I believe that there is a small element.  The luck occurs from a practical standpoint, in the actual playing of a game.  Consider a move in a game of Hex.  You place a stone on a certain hexagon based on certain deductions that you've made about helping you connect your sides.  But suppose, say three moves later, you realize that your move was actually very good for other reasons that you had not seen.  In some real sense you got lucky.

It should be remembered, though, that any element of luck averages out tremendously over time, so that your overall performance over many games played involves almost no luck at all.
