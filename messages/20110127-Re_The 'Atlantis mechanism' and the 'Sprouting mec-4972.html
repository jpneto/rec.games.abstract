Interesting.  Link?  Or a more specific description for those of us who
don't know Shogi?

I don't think there's a link to it; I only know of the game from
direct correspondence with its inventor many years ago, and
publication in Pritchard's "The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants", in
the making of which Christian had a part, I believe.

When you capture an opposing piece, it changes color and goes into
your reserve.  In Shogi, you can drop a piece from your reserve almost
anywhere on the board (there are a few restrictions) instead of making
a move.  In Shogi, therefore, there is no such thing as an "endgame",
but rather the game is a checkmating race.  In Renaissance, only a
resurrector move can bring pieces onto the board from the reserve, and
players also start with two pieces that are in the reserve from the
beginning.
