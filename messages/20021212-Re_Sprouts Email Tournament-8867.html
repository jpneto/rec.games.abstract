A simpler and more accurate statement would be, "It's always wrong to
move there," rather than, "It might as well not exist."  It does, after
all, provide a losing option in some winning positions.

Moving to a type 1 UT, on the other hand, is never necessary in a
winning position.  For that reason, we might call such a move "wrong"
from a practical standpoint.  But such a move does not necessarily
screw up a winning position either, so a lawyer might take exception
to your calling your statement "more accurate" even in the case of
type 1 UTs.

You can say, "There's always another move elsewhere that's at least as
good," if you like that better.

As Nick said, if you would write "moving in [such a position]", rather
than, "moving to [such a position]", that would be more consistent with
the usual language of combinatorial game theory.  The usual notion is
that a game can have several components; the moving player picks a move
"in" one of those components.
