	Glad you asked, Pedro!
	Lines Of Action is actively played in a postal chess and games
club called NOST (stands for kNights Of the Square Table). Of the non-
chess games played in the club, it is easily the most popular. The name
has not changed, but we sometimes call it LOA for short.

I wrote a shareware version of Lines of Action for the Macintosh a few years
ago.  I changed the name to "Unite" because there was another version
with the same name, so I wanted to avoid confusion.  I was planning to
update it and release a color version soon, but I seem to have my hands
full with other things.  If you're interested in getting the black/white
version (runs on most Macintoshes), send me e-mail (I'mn not sure if it's
on any of the usual servers anymore).
