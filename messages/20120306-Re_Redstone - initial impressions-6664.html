It certainly feels a very interesting variant, and I'd happily put it alongside Go for depth and value, but how deep that rabbit hole goes is still unanswered.

'Deep', in this context, is a human criterion. How deep is Hex? That
would appear to be the wrong question up to and including base-8:

Quote:
"To date we have solved 28 of the 41 asymmetric 9×9 openings; however
this likely represents only a small fraction of the time needed to
solve all 9×9 openings. For example, on smaller n×n boards, solving
all openings adjacent to a White
edge takes more than half of the the time to solve all n×n openings."

The fact that 8x8 is solved wouldn't make it any less difficult for a
beginning human player, but he would be playing in the shadow of
perfect play. The question 'how deep' has become irrelevant in a
gametheoretical sense.

Scaling is a good means to steer away from solvability and since most
games are clearly less interesting if it is overdone, there's usually
a range best suited for any particular game. Other factors may play a
role, as you pointed out with the life versus thickness argument. Go
is not just 'linear scalable' like Hex, it is like an organism that
'breathes' within a balance area between the center and the edges and
corners. Finding this optimum required eons of playing experience, and
the debate now has obviously narrowed down to 19x19 or 21x21, where
practical arguments support the former.

So considering 'depth' in human terms, and given the right size,
Redstone, like many other games, has "nowhere to go but deeper". No
worries there.
Another thing is in how far humans are able to read sequences of
moves. Are there "advantageous sub-goals to be reached as <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>calculable<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
signposts along the way"? Here differences emerge, like between Go and
Othello. Sure, there are 'advatageous sub-goals' in Othello, but these
are dwarfed both in number and calculability by those in Go. A Go
position is usually 'clear', and to a degree even for a beginner,.
Othello is a white/black flippery blob. I remember one of the first
World Champions playing three Othello games against the English Chess
grandmaster Tony Miles, who never played a game before, and losing
one.

To which category belongs Redstone? In this context, I'd say the 'Go
category', but not quite Go. A Go position gives the observer an
immediate impression of what's going on. I'm not sure if Redstone
would eventually have the same degree of clarity. Also, I'm not sure
how far a game would progress, for instance with the number of red
stones as a measure, before one player is bumped off. Your first game
at Life in 19x19 ended with two red stones and a full board.

My main doubt regarding the game is how the thematic schizophrenia
will work out. The spirit of Go is one of co-existence. A pie is
divided, and the one achieving the bigger piece wins. Nobody dies but
a couple of stones. Redstone takes a constructive mechanism to a
destructive end. It's almost like Martin Medema's game  'Atlantis',
where 'explosions' are the means to build a wall, not after the
explosion, no <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>by<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the explosion.

Redstone is a valid game with 'a solid architecture' as Mark would put
it, but I fear for its clarity and I have doubts regarding the use Go
mecanics as means to annihilation. That however may be a matter of
taste.

I'm unsure how much the annihilation is necessary. It's an endpoint, but the first game I played was stopped because the winner was clear (as was the second one). There'd have been red stones all over the board if it was played out, but it's unnecessary.

I take your point that it's rather an antithema to the spirit of Go, but then that's probably ok, because it's Redstone rather than Go :P I'm more than happy with the contest for the sake of the contest, rather than a belief that I'm actually sharing out metaphoric lands with another warlord somewhere. I'm pretty certain professionals are after the win, rather than the spirit of the game, so I hope I'm not committing heresy by saying it.
