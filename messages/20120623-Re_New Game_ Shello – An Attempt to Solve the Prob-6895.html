Mark therein lies the rub, it was that very lack of familiarity with Go that made the first incarnation of Red Stone imperfect. Luis however was very familiar with the ins and outs of Go and was able to suggest a rule that improved the design in a very fundamental way.

In fact, you only got the idea to use neutral stones 'cerebral'. Big deal.. There's Reversi with neutral stones, a well-known mancala with neutral stones, Draughts with neutral men, it's not all that remarkable to have the idea. Congrats anyway.

Yeah I have to agree. If Mark came out with Oust today and then someone suggested the extra move rule and he failed to give them credit for making the game functional, we'd have the exact same situation. Its hardly remarkable that the introduction of unassailable red stones punctuating every capture will result in a finite game.

Nice idea by the way, Nick, but leaning a bit on Slither.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Shello not at all like Slither since its not even a connection game and the protocol is completely different. I don't want to see every game with a place and move protocol to be compared to Slither from now on. Quentin is more similar to Slither than Shifty because Quentin utilizes the banned diagonal and that rule was unprecedented till the advent of Slither.
