Hello everyone! I was recommended to come here a long time ago, but I didn't know much about newsgroups, so I never did. I wish I had! But, better late than never, I suppose.

A while ago, I started a little site about cooperative abstract games:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.coopabstractgames.info/">http://www.coopabstractgames.info/</a>

Obviously, there's not a lot there, since... well, there's not a lot of coop abstract games, as far as I know. I did a search on this group and didn't find much either. So if anyone has any suggestions of games to add on there, I would welcome that.

The game that got me the suggestion to come here was a Chess variant (but not really a Chess variant) called Chain of Fools:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/fools.html">http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/fools.html</a>

Since then, I've expanded Chain of Fools into a cooperative variant called Catalonia:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/catalonia">http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/catalonia</a>

I really didn't consider whether this stuff had been done before, but I welcome your comments or suggestions. I would like to expand this idea into a more complex cooperative/competitive hybrid game, but lack the people to test with at the moment.
