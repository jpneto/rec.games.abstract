As a side note, the picture shows Scarne's son, who was given the middle
name Teeko, after the game.  How'd you like to have Scrabble, Salta, Twixt,
or even Chinese Checkers as your middle name?  I guess Bridgit might not be
too bad, if your dad invented that game.  Othello, too, I suppose;  though
I'd hate to go through life knowing I was just a copy of something older,
with a minor variation.

And then there's Monty Python's "Mr. Neutron" - however
the sketch was relased a few years <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>before<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the abstract
game "Neutron" was published. I definitely would not like
to have "Hex" as a middle name, which (with x replaced by
ks) means "witch" in Norwegian.
