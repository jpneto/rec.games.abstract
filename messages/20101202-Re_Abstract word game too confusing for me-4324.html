My replies were actually rather matter of factly. I'm sorry if they
gave the impression of an abundance of feelings ;-). However, it is
obvious from sentences like "In the unlikely case that there are valid
points to answer, my answers will be in r.g.c. where you can consider
them and ask further at your leisure" that Bill not only hates
answering at the risk of criticism (which he obviously doen't expect
at r.g.c.) but takes Pride of Place in your group as the source that
"will explain all". Enlightenment awaits in Shangri La. How can you
stand it, I wonder.
