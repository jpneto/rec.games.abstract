<br>I have never come across your phase of "perfect information" until
<br>now, and after taking the treat into my mouth, my thoughts turned
<br>sweet, "I don't know what feels better winning with perfect
<br>information or winning with imperfect information."
<br>
<br>In a world of imperfect information, I see your point of view for
<br>liking games with perfect information. But, I think games with perfect
<br>information played by two equal players are really games at all, no
<br>games as we know it anyway, winners and losers, etc. The games amount
<br>to a draw or not worth playing because of its known outcome. Think
<br>something like tic-tak-toe multiplied a thousand times or so.
<br>
<br>But there is so much more to a world, and game, with imperfect
<br>information.

<br>
<br>&nbsp;i think you were thinking about abstract games that were
<br>&nbsp;<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>solved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and thus all the information from start to finish
<br>&nbsp;was known.&nbsp; every position was solved, every subsequent
<br>&nbsp;course of action was known.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;the usual use of the term "perfect information" here is a
<br>&nbsp;more of a reference to the starting conditions and the course
<br>&nbsp;of play - you see the entire playing environment, there are no
<br>&nbsp;cards face down, no secretive wall preventing you from seeing
<br>&nbsp;any information, no random roll of dice to determine anything
<br>&nbsp;in the course of a turn.
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;the only thing that isnt perfect in this sense is in the thinking
<br>&nbsp;process of the players, who are only bound by their own wetware
<br>&nbsp;shortcomings.
