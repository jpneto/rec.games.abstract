So, as people here know, Boardgame Geek has decided to create
categories for different game genres, from Wargames to now "Abstract
Games", and enable people to discuss these genres.  Also included are
list of discussions relating to games that BGG consides "abstract
games".  For reference, here is the link to the discussion area:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/4666/abstract-games">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamesubdomain/4666/abstract-games</a>

I will say that  Boardgame Geek has an, "interesting" way of
classifying what are abstract strategy games. I have try to take into
account what they qualify as "abstract strategy games" but end up
feeling the approach they use is too broad. The site will throw a
Tetris-like game like FITS under abstract strategy games, for lack
of knowing where else to put it. Dominoes is put under there, as is
Ingenious.

Well, this might not be important, but Boardgame Geek is, by default,
THE reference site for everything boardgames, and is a place of
influence. Because of this, I believe it would be beneficial for
people who have an interest in abstract strategy games,  to also pop
in there from time to time, and post, and read. To go in and end up
calling Boardgame geek on this game or that being classified as an
abstract strategy game, or a game NOT being one (see Through the
Desert) would be of help I believe. Also, it would enable people who
are "purists" regarding abstract strategy games, to get in contact
with people who aren't and understand what they are thinking. Getting
involved would also help give abstracts a better voice, and get more
solid boundaries.

And that is why I say the forum matters.  If you want to be able to
have the directory on the Internet classify abstract strategy games
closer to the pure definition of them, that is a key place to do it.
And, in doing this, perhaps the genre of "abstract strategy games"
will be treated less as a junk drawer.

Anyhow, one can hope here.  May not matter in the end, but at least I
say it is worth considering, and why it would matter.
