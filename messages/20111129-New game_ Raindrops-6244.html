FWIW, I'm posting the rules here, too:


RAINDROPS
-------------------

Raindrops is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and
White. It's played on the intersections (from now on points) of an
even-sized square grid. The recommended size is between 8 and 12
points per side. At the start of the game, the board is full of stones
arranged in a checkered pattern.

- Definitions

In this rules, adjacent always means orthogonally adjacent. Lines
can be horizontal or vertical.

A unit is a singleton or group. A singleton is a piece with no
adjacencies to like-colored pieces. A group is a set of like-colored,
adjacent pieces.

A unit is said to be engaged if it can join one or more friendly units
or capture an enemy unit on a single turn, from the current board
position.

- Play

Starting with Black, players take turns moving units of their own
color, one unit per turn. All moves are along a single line, and to
points which are either empty or occupied by enemy stones.

Singletons slide any number of unoccupied points, like chess rooks.
To move a group, you must take one of its pieces and place it on
another point which is adjacent to the group, without splitting the
group at any moment. You can keep re-arranging pieces from the group
in this way as long as you want, but every moved piece must be placed
adjacent to the previous one, in the same line and direction. The
movement line must be one of the rows or columns already occupied by
the group before the move. During the move, if you join another
friendly unit which lies in the movement line, your turn ends. If you
join a friendly unit which is not in the movement line, said unit can
be rearranged along with the rest, always in the same line, while it
is still your turn. (See examples in the link above.)

When moving a unit, if you place a piece on a point occupied by an
enemy piece, the entire enemy unit to which this piece belongs is
removed from the board, and your turn ends.

If you move an engaged unit, that must reduce the total number of
groups on the board. If you move an unengaged unit, you must engage
it. Passing is not allowed.

- End of the game

If, at the end of a turn, one of the players has only one unit on the
board, that player wins. If both players have only one unit left, the
last moving player wins.
