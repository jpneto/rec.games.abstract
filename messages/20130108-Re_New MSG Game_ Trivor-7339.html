There's one difference, of course: with the pie rule, we know that perfect

one can't argue either way. In that sense, the latter is better.

You've gorged yourself on Christian's bullshit, Luis.  Yum yum.  In Symple there is certainly an advantage to one player or the other, just as there is with the pie rule.  Being unknown which player is advantaged doesn't make it "better".  It's just unknown, making it worse.  

If the Symple board were small enough, the advantaged player would certainly be known.  Nobody has bothered to investigate this for fear of rocking the "perfection" boat.

Perfection can't occur in an abstract game.  You can achieve a virtual perfection with a large enough board - an advantage statistically consistent with zero percent with a limited data sample.  But not an advantage that's exactly zero.  Christian, who was a math teacher, should know this.  Pity all the poor students of his running around with a misguided understanding of perfection.  You're one of them, Luis.
