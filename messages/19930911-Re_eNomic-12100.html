Is there any particular reason why there has to exist

We could have a forest instead of a tree, you know.
A while back, someone (I can't remember who, because he didn't reply to me)
said he had started a game called "Senator" that was very much similar in spirit.
I'm all for having some general clearing-house or single post-master for games
of this TYPE, but I'll be DARNED if I'm going to tolerate going all the way 
from

   101.  All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
	 in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
	 Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
	 The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
	 201-219 (Mutable).

to
   212.  If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
	 two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the Rule
	 with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
	   If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
	 that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence
	 over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions shall
	 supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.
	   If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another or
etc.
to
   219.   etc.

Some LIKE it hard, but THIS legalese is just completely unnecessary.
I would rather spend more time thinking about the rules the PLAYERS
make than assimilating the ones the original author (who was a law
professor, NOT a programmer) drafted, and I CAN'T see why that STYLE
of rule-writing remains popular.  If it sounds like I'm getting ready to
propose a shorter set of immutable rules for the purpose of starting a
game, then maybe I've foreshadowed successfully.  But I don't want to
do this in ignorance of whatever other efforts may already be going
on.  I want to co-operate with whoever's already in charge.
I would also like to hear whether the Senator game was ever
resurrected.
