The idea:
Each player is a fervent party-goer and the goal of the game is to become a
P-A, i.e. someone who - amongst other things - is:
1.) invited to all the cool parties and not invited to the uncool ones, because
uncool parties are thrown by uncool people and they wouldn't dare ask a P-A
to come.
2.) never at a loss for the right thing to say when small-talking.
3.) always the focal point of a party, never standing around by himself.
4.) sucked up to by all uncool people.
5.) generally one of the major VIPs in town.
6.) the winner of the game, reaping whatever benefits there are to be reaped

&gt;from winning a game.

Apart from the 17 players there are also lots of other guests at the party,
whose behavior is not necessarily known to the players. Each party a different
set of 'other' guests is generated more or less randomly, along with some
regulars like the mayor.

If you get this running as a PBM game, I'd like to join (I have, alas, not
really the time needed to participate in the design right now. Maybe in a month
or two.) I like the idea very much.
