The "member programmable" part is still in the works.

By real real time I mean you see your opponent's move virtually
instantaneously.  For some games, including Oust, real real time isn't
needed.  When every move takes over a minute, you don't notice little, two
second delays.  It's only when you want to play lightning fast that real
real time is essential.  Real real time also makes playing more realistic. 
You become aware that you're seeing your opponent's moves as they happen. 
Not after arbitrary, random delays.

If you're an abstract game designer who understands architecture, i.e. if
your name is Corey, Nick, Greg, or Steve, drop Daniel Savarese a line.

The only other real real time sites (with modern abstracts) I know of are
Ludoteka and Boardspace.
