Both of those figures sound about right.  Obviously, if you have a 50%
chance of beating them at chess, you'll still have a 50% chance of
beating them at Quack.  However, this changes at this point.  A player
with a 51% chance will have a slightly greater than 51% chance of
beating them at Quack.  What's the formula?

As you say below, it's a best-of-5 game. So if the
probability of winning at chess is p, then the
probability of winning at Quack (draws ignored) is

   10 p^3 (1-p)^2           (3-2)
 +  5 p^4 (1-p)             (4-1)
 +    p^5                   (5-0)

= p^3 (10 - 20p + 10p^2 + 5p - 5p^2 + p^2)
= p^3 (10 - 15p + 6p^2)

...So, for every level in chess, there
are about two levels in Quack. Quack
is therefore much more complicated than
chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Hmmmmnn... let me think about this.  My first reaction is that "Quack"
isn't more 'complicated' at all.  Quack is simply a best 3-out-of-5 game
chess match.  (The winner is the first person to win three games.)  And
thus being the same game, it would be equally as complicated.
