I don't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>think<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> I was the one who started the "defect-free games"
thred-- maybe just helped it along a bit.  In any case, Melfin
Nicholson gets into the action and proposes some criteria for defect-free:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
1: state should be limited to position of pieces on the board and whose
turn it is, with no reference to 'previous board positions' and other
phenominon which must be tracked
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So you would consider a "no repeated positions" rule a defect?  I'm
not sure whether I do or not-- but then again, these are very aesthetic
questions; no surprise that we don't all agree.  Hmm-- what happens
if you eliminate such a rule, anyway?  You end up im places where
the players might loop forever... if you just say that's a loss for
both of them, does that take care of it?  No, I suppose not, because
there's no good way to decide which one should break the loop.
Pity.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
2: the rules should not admit special cases and be symmetric to all
peices and positions
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sometimes it's hard to say what's a special case.  The starting
position in [othello/reversi] always seemed somewhat arbitrary to
me; one of the beauties of go was the fact that the board starts
empty, and only the strategy inherent in the rules determines
the first move.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3: the rules should be stable in a concise way, and not too numerous
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

(statable, I assume you mean.)  Hmm (evil grin)-- how about Mornington
Crescent?  From one point of view, the rules are not too numerous,
but not statable at all; from another, there are arbitrarily many
rules.  And yet, it's an incredibly aesthetic game... ah, but I suppose
there are those that would argue that it doesn't qualify as an abstract
game, given the definitions I've seen posted here.  (imho, if MC isn't
abstract, what <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, but that's personal...)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
While I agree that defect free status isn't all that wonderful of a
thing (as someone pointed out, tic-tac-toe is quite 'defect free' in
this since, but in general is a lousy game), I do sympathise with the
aesthetic quality the original author was trying to put his finger on.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think flawlessness needs some kind of not-too-easy characteristic...
I think that perfect play being known is definitely a flaw, for example.
Yes, I realize how arbitrary "known" is... maybe "practical to play"?
One of the appeals of "mental jujitsu" is that it's state-tree isn't
computable, because players don't alternate-- but I think that's
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>too<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much to ask from a poor innocent little game...
