Everyone considers Chess to be an abstract game even though it has
kings, queens, knights, etc.  There is certainly a theme there at
least in the naming of the pieces but it's so superficial that it
obviously has no bearing on the gameplay, even to someone who has only
read the rules but never played.

But that goes for very many games. The theme in chess is not entirely
unconnected to the pieces - the knight jumps, the king is more
important than the other pieces, and so on.

This is a sidetrack, but it would be possible to define a game that
was completely equivalient to chess, but played on a single line, with
all the "complexity" of the board moved to the movement rules.
That would (partially) break the "theme" of the game as a bunch of
things happening in an area, and incidentally make it immensely much
harder (and duller!) for humans to play.
So theme is a fluid thing. But what makes a difference, I think, is
the degree to which the game has rules dictated by the theme. An
extreme example is classic miniature wargames, where they strived for
the highest degree of realism that the players could stand without
being bored to tears by table lookups. I don't play these games
myself, but I suppose the payoff is the immersion in the theme, that
you feel as if you are a real millitary tactical genius playing out
historical battles.
But who says the original versions of chess weren't like that, for the
people who played them originally?
