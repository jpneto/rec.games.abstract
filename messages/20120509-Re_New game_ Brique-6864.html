What's the over/under on how many connection games you'll have designed before you're finished with them? We need a betting pool.

This is the last but one, I promise. :) They're 6 games total: Quaxtep, Konobi, Quentin, Orcoon, Brique and Vimbre.

I think Quentin and Vimbre are the best of them. Quentin is probably the most enjoyable and by far the one I've played the most, but Vimbre is the one with the cleanest feel and the most elegant anti-deadlock mechanism.

Orcoon is the worst in the series. From a pure gameplay standpoint, it's placed very high on the scale, and I have a weakness for it, but it offends anyone's aesthetic sense, whether you play it with races or banning those six draw patterns. In retrospect it seems more an experiment than anything else.

Vimbre fixes all the flaws in Orcoon in an original way and it's pretty much what I was looking for when I started exploring this particular field, i.e. a game which felt as close to Hex as possible in simplicity, clarity and pace, so it looks like the perfect finishing touch to the series.

 From a design point of view, I'm equally proud of Vimbre and Brique. Unlike Quentin, they weren't easy finds at all, and I'm glad I made the effort to design them. It was a great learning experience.

I just hope people will enjoy playing these games as much as I enjoyed designing them :)
