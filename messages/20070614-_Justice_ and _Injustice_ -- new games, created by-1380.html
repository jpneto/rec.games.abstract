My new invention, the games "Justice" and
"Injustice", are on their surface just a variation
of Nim. But the strategies are different, they
need to be studied and the winning strategy
has yet to be discovered.

You start the game with any number of plates
with (small :-) stones on them. A move consists
of removing any positive number of stones
from exactly one plate.

JUSTICE: if after your move there is the same
number of stones on each of the plates then
you ** WIN ** (and your opponent loses).

INJUSTICE: if after your move there is the same
number of stones on each of the plates then
your opponent wins, you ** LOSE **.

Enjoy,

Wlodzimierz Holsztynski
