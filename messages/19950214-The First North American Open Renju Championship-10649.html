The First North American Open Renju Championship by E-Mail.
-----------------------------------------------------------


The North American Renju Federation is proud to announce The First North
American Open Renju Championship by E-Mail.

The game renju is also known as gomoku or five-in-a-row. 

The RULES OF RENJU are very simple: 

Two players put black and white stones on the board of 15 horizontal and
15 vertical lines. A player who has black stones makes the first move on
the center of the board. The goal is to complete a row of five stones of the
same color. 

The difference between gomoku and renju is that in renju moves, creating
double three, double four, and a row of more than five stones are not
allowed for black. These restrictions make the chances to win for black
and for white more equal. 

All of you who wish to participate in the Championship will be given
detailed rules of the game and the tournament.

The First North American Open Renju Championship by e-mail will begin on
March 1, 1995 and will last for 6 months. We invite participants from
around the world. Participants will exchange their moves by e-mail. The
Referee of the tournament is Mr. Alexander Lipsits (2711 Jenner Drive Apt.
C, Baltimore, MD 21209, USA, tel. (410) 358-4478).
