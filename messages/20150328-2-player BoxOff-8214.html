I thought of a fun way to adapt BoxOff to 2 players.  The board is filled as usual with randomly laid stones.  One player is called Good, and the other player is called Bad.  Good tries to make good matches so as to clear as many stones as possible.  Bad tries to make bad matches so as to interfere with this.  The number of stones remaining at the end of the game is Good's score.

If desired, a second game can be played with the identical set-up, but with the players' roles reversed.  The scores are then compared and a winner is declared.
