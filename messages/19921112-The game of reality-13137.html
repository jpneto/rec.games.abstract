Here's an interesting (dare I call it?) game.

It is called Reality. I've first seen it in the comicbook "Sandman" #4, by DC
comics.

The game is quite simple. One player says what he is; the other has to be 
something stronger, and so on. For example, here is a free interpretation of
the duel that occures in the comic, where Morpheus has to play the reality 
with one of Hell's demon. The demon has the first move.

Demon: "I'm a dire wolf, prey stalking."
Dream: "I'm a hunter, horse riding, spear carrying."
Demon: "I'm a horsefly, horse stinging, throwing the hunter off his saddle."
Dream: "I'm a spider, fly devouring."
Demon: "I'm a snake, spider eating."
Dream: "I'm an oax, snake crushing. I feel the snake die under my weight,
         his spine broken."

This is where it gets real interesting:

Demon: "I'm an anthrax, life butcherer."
Dream: "I'm a world, life nurturing."
Demon: "I'm a nova, all exploding, planet cremating."
Dream: "I'm the Universe, all encompassing, every life."
Demon: "I am the Anti-Life, the Beast of Judgement, the Darkness at the end
        of existence, the end of worlds, of life, of gods. Of everything."



Dream: "I am hope."



Good, isn't it? The player that can't find something stronger than his
 adversary loses. In the example above, the demon, who couldn't find something,was sent for eternal suffering in the Pits of Hell.
Of course, you don't have to play for such high stakes...

Enjoy!
