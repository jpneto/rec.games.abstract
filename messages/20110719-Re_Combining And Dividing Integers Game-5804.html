How does "combining and dividing" start if the numbers chosen to begin
the game is: (5, 7)?

Is player 2 declared the winner because player 1 doesn't get a chance
to do any work that will cause him "get" a list completely of primes
or "combining and dividing" would start anyway and thus player 1 would
be forced to combine two numbers into one in his first move?

Realized after posting that it doesn't matter. Player 2 wins in both
cases.

If you started with (2,11) then it would matter. My interpretation is that
player 1 loses because there are no legal moves from any position that
contains only primes. He can't add 2+11 and pass the lone 13 to player 2.

But if you start with (3,10) then player 1 is allowed to do 3+10=13 and win,
because player 2 can't do anything with the 13.
