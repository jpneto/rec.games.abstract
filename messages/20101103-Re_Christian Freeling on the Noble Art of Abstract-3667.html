It's incredibly frustrating to me that 90% of the posts here (and

Nick, you're right, you're right, and you're right.  But this is a
discussion group, and discussion worthy abstract games don't come along that
often, as Corey Clark has demonstrated with Ki.

A group has an identity.  We don't have a charter or founding fathers or
anything like that.  All we've got is a name - rec.games.abstract.  It's up
to the members... strike that.  We don't have members.  It's up to the
posters how we interpret that name.

When I got here a couple years back, the group identity, it gradually began
to emerge, was synonymous with Bill Taylor.  I kept wondering why but the
search apparently ends at Projex.  BFD.

Abstract games are not math.  There's a lot of overlap but they aren't the
same thing.  There was a distinct math flavor here evidenced by the
occasional introduction of a nitwit Nim variant, and everyone getting giddy
over it, lemma quotes flowing like wine.  You may be admired in your
associate professorship at Bullshit U, but you ain't shit here.  Get that
straight.

I don't even really blame Bill Taylor for sprawling out here and
pontificating to an audience of nitwits.  If that floats his boat and people
were willing to listen, then why not?  Ralf Gering has fans who listen to
him.  I don't know if it's charisma or bullshit or what with these guys. 
There's certainly no basis in reality for their celebrity.
Rec.games.abstract was the most likely place for Bill Taylor to set up camp.
 But then I got here and it was like, Hey fatso, get the fuck out of the
way.

Now rec.games.abstract is no longer Bill Taylor central.  Laugh or cry, we
can all agree on that.  Thank me or curse me.  It's your prerogative.

Rec.games.abstract must have one of the highest lurker to poster ratios on
Usenet.  Everyone in abstract games reads this group.  What direction will
it go, inquiring minds would want to know?  Mopey Bill sits in his cubicle
every day cursing rec.games.abstract.  In his view, the group was ruined by
me, and it will never have a legitimate purpose again - the ludicrous
premise being that hosting Bill Taylor and his posse of nitwits was a
legitimate purpose in the first place.

But now Taylor's inept premonition is threatened by legitimate designer
Christian Freeling showing up, invited by none other than me, the destroyer
troll!  And that's all Bill Taylor can take, apparently.  Before you know
it, Professor Bill is pecking away at his keyboard in his cubicle, forming
ascii troll pictures of me.  This is where your tuition dollars go.

How come there are so many impossibly
sensitive egos wrapped up in an endeavour for which the stakes could
not possibly be smaller?  If there's an activity with less cosmic
significance that abstract game design I don't know what it is.

I sense that the cosmic significance of abstract games and the associated
"stakes" are growing.  I don't know why but I feel it.
