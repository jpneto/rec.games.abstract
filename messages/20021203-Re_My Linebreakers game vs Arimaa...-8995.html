I wanted to see how competently Zillions played the game.  Apparently
the designer of Arimaa says it doesn't play a good game, as expected.
I am curious how well Zillions will play my Linebreaker game.  I would
need to code that.

It's apparently even more expected since, as you pointed out, the game's
designer established the Zillions rules for it.  How much more bias can we
introduce into this trial?  In any event, I beat the Zillions implementation
on my first try, by marching my elephant, a dog, and one rabbit up the
lefthand side of the board--all the while Zillions monkeying around with his
elephant wreaking havoc with the rest of my forces.  Nobody would ever, ever
play this game like that in real life, unless they were a) trying to lose,
b) on great painkillers, c) stupid (does not necessarily preclude the first
two categories), or d) took pity on me.  Since Zillions had the added
advantage of playing Silver, and responding to all my initial
placements--big surprise, he sticks most of his rabbits in his back row no
matter what I do--it was even more depressing that he couldn't avert my
little ensemble.  I believe that Zillions is a fantastic device, but I would
prefer that somebody else implement Arimaa for it before I get all excited
about my win....
