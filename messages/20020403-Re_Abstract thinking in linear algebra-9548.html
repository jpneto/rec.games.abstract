I am very pleased to be reading this.  I'm coming to the end of my
rope in a math program and my frustration seems almost normal here.
I'd like to note that I'm a non-traditional (25+ years old) student
and that I have had an "A" in every engineering/science level math
class so far.  Currently, I'm taking Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra,
among other classes.

Actually, my text has quite a bit of proof in it and my professors,
both calculus and linear algebra, teach proof during class, as well as
perform very difficult problems so we can see the techniques.  In
linear algebra we're required to prove things both in graded homework
and on tests.

But not enough.  One problem is that computation precedes
doing a careful job with theory.  It should be the other
way around; understand theory, and then apply it.

This question wasn't asked of me, but I will give my answer for what
it's worth..  I think the whole system of how math is taught needs to
be reworked.  At the moment it is goal oriented... people have to be
good enough with numbers to do this or that... and to heck with the
rest.  What a holey mess.

Analysis should be introduced when the idea of infinite
decimals comes in.  It is not necessary to memorize a large
bunch of techniques; anyone who understands the ideas can
look up or derive the techniques.

1.  I wish I could see logic and math taught together ... throw in a
little set theory too... at the high school level, and carried through
at each step of the way.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The full predicate logic belongs at the elementary school
level.  It has been taught to the "upper half" of fifth
graders, and I believe it can be done earlier for more.

What you call set theory is probably what I call set
algebra, and can be done in a week or so by anyone who has
even had sentential logic.  Introductory rigorous set
theory at the ZF or NBG level can well be taught in high
school.

Rigorous algebra and analysis belong at the high school
level as well.  Abstract algebra is easier to understand
than cookbook if someone has the ability, and is much
easier to understand before the cookbook.  The same holds
for everything else; the calculus student has been told
that he has been given an understanding of calculus, when
in fact this is not the case; it is only with analysis that
the understanding appears.

This even applies to engineering students.  It is more
important that an engineer know what a differential equation
means and can use this to translate a real-world problem into
such, without knowing how to solve it, than putting down an
equation he knows how to solve, but which is not correct.

2.  Give people the option to learn physics, analysis and calculus
together over a period of time much much longer than presently.  Call
it a combined masters program in applied math or something... give it
about 7 years.  Or maybe we need to admit that a 4 year program isn't
very workable in math?  Let's face it.. .it's a much harder subject
than almost any other.

Keep the subjects separate and do them in logical order, and
then it can be done in far less time.

3.  Why should professors have to teach at breakneck speed and
practically not have time to answer questions in class?  Shouldn't a
math class take at least 2-3 hours to allow for discussion,
reflection, thought, etc?  My professors constantly have to snub
questions, or cut corners, because they simply don't have time to get
into it.  Asking for explanation during office hours is a necessary
ritual.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have never found this to be a problem.  Possibly, they are 
spending too much time doing routine manipulations in class,
and not teaching the concepts.  On the other hand, one who
does teach the concepts is likely to get very low evaluations
from the "students" who are not like you, but who demand that
only a catalog of techniques be taught.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4.  Professors who yell or belittle students in class or out of it
should simply not be allowed to teach.  They might think they're
performing "tough love" but in reality they're destroying the one
thing that makes math possible: faith in ones self.  Math is hard
enough without having to deal with the schoolyard-level egos of some
professors too.

I think I'm experiencing many of the downsides to the current system.
But I don't see a way out of it for me.. other than to accept the
reality and move on into the applied math world... ( numerical
analysis and engineering..).. and teach myself real math on my own
time in a more suitable environment for thinking.

Incidentally, I've placed a few quiet questions in the department and
have a couple of professor's assurance that I could occasionally ask
for a bit of help on the confusing matters.  I cannot tell you how
immensely relieved I am for that.  I hope that others who feel as I do
will find their own creative way to deal with the situation.
