This thread has about come to the point where someone calls for Hikaru

Having encountered a mention of Hikaru no Go in my searches for
information on Go, I then heard a friend who was learning Japanese
note that he had seen that anime in Shonen Jump. I saw a few issues at
a local secondhand bookstore, but glancing through them, I was not
impressed; too many of the plots depended on people actually cheating
at Go, which I suspect is just as rare as cheating at Chess in direct
over-the-board play - that is, virtually nonexistent. (Cheating by
computer consultation, on the other hand, is a big problem, but that's
quite different from moving stones or knocking down one's opponent's
hand...)
