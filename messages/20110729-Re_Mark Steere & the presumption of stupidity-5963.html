My last attempts to post to this and one other thread appear to have
gotten lost in cyberspace, so I'll try again.  If both show up, I sure
hope they are consistent! :o

I would have to play MQ a bunch of times both with and without the
anti-cycle baby move in order to know whether it was a bazooka or not.

As far as the game's representation, it makes much more sense to me to
use the "queen as piece-type" representation than the "queen as stack"
representation.  The latter came about because the game was originally
intended to compete in a stacking contest, but since that has come and
gone I see no reason not to change to the more logical representation
of queen as a piece type and babies starting off the board.
