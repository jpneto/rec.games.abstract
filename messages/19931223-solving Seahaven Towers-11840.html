I'm about to post the source for my program that solves Seahaven Towers
positions.  It only solves opening positions, but it wouldn't be hard to
extend it to handle midgame positions.  I've pounded on it a bit, in
particular comparing its results to those of the program in the Modula-3
distribution, and they agree as to the solubility of all positions tested
(except for a few where the Modula-3 program couldn't decide).

The program compiles on SunOS 5.1.  It should compile on other Unix
systems, and I hope I've got the code right for DOS as well.  (There's
some use of the time functions to initialise a random number generator,
since one of the options lets you use the program to generate random
positions.)

Note that the program does not let you interactively play the game; it
just tests for winnability.  On my SparcStation II it takes about 0.2 sec
per position.

And for the curious: I had it generate a million random positions to see
how many were winnable.  The answer: 89.11%.
