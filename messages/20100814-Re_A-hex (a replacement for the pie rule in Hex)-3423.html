Here's a snippet from our last game chat:

=======
[15:18:46]Liberte&gt; I noticed your game M-Torus appears to actually on
the real projective plane

[15:18:58]Liberte&gt; actually be played*

[15:19:29]Liberte&gt; maybe I'm mistaken but it confused me because it's
not really a torus

[15:22:08]MarkSteere&gt; So, what's all the excitement about M-Torus from
5 years ago.

[15:22:24]MarkSteere&gt; I took that off my website because it was too
similar to a Bill Taylor game?

[15:22:44]Liberte&gt; yeah Projex, I know

[15:23:02]Liberte&gt; but it's not a trous is all

[15:23:05]Liberte&gt; torus*

[15:23:22]MarkSteere&gt; So? I never said it was. Who gives a shit?
=======

I don't like wiseasses.

Fine Mark. You don't like wiseasses? So what? It doesn't mean you have
to make a big spectacle of it. How is this round five? The most
wiseass thing I did was try to copy the design process for Oust,
making a game called Proust. Well Mark, I don't have many ideas of
where to start with making a game and the idea of making a game that
followed that particular design process was appealing to me. So what
if I inform you that M-Torus is not on a torus? I didn't know you had
written off that game to be honest. If I had made that game I would've
been interested myself (which it seemed you were. But of course that
would be too easy, wouldn't it?). and I didn't even realize the M in M-
torus stood for Mobius until I asked you what is stood for. So maybe
it's round dos, if your really intent of thinking of it in such
negative terms in the first place. To be honest I didn't give a shit,
it was just that I stumbled upon a wiki article that happened to be
relevant to a game you designed. I think you're blowing everything out
of proportion here. I can barely consider this in the context of
reality, it's just so absurd. You need to admit when you've won. You
practically have had a lapdog with me. :P Besides all this, it would
be nice to have some serious discussion about game design with you,
which I have tried to strike up, without having it really go anywhere.
Thank you for your patience and understanding :)
