=&gt; anybody out there know about the game of life?  it's sort of a computer

i am
=&gt; posting this.  it was something like a piece could stay alive if it was
=&gt; adjacent to 2 or three other pieces, and there were rules for new  
pieces
=&gt; being born.  if anybody out there knows the rules, i would appreciate  
it if
=&gt; you could mail them to me.
=&gt; 
=&gt; i hope this post wasn't too vague.

I won't repeat the rules, for several other people on this group have  
already answered this question, but let me just say that life is a really  
FACINATING little operation that deserves to be played with for hours and  
marks an interesting field for computers.  Eventually cellular automata  
like 'life' led to the study of artificial life on computers.  
I wrote a Life program with Turbo Pascal for the IBM and toyed with it for  
hours.  It's quite fascinating.
Oh, and thanks, John Haas, for introducing me to the 'spaceship'.  I'd  
known about the gliders but the spaceship was a new one to me.  I'll have  
to go home and tinker with that one for a while.....
