** STOICAL GO **

In this Go variant, standard ko rules don't apply. Instead, it's illegal to make a capture if your opponent made a capture on his previous move.

All other rules are the same as in Go. Suicide of one or more stones is not allowed, and area scoring is used.

All known forced Go cycles (most of which are described at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Cycle">http://senseis.xmp.net/?Cycle</a>) are impossible with this rule. The nature of the rule itself suggests that forced cycles are either impossible or astronomically rarer than they are in Go when the superko rule is not used.

A while ago, I posted on LifeIn19x19.com about this rule, which I then called "passive ko":

I've also programmed the game for Zillions of Games:

I've included all odd-sized boards from 7x7 to 19x19, as well as the option to use neutral blocking pieces to change the shape of the board.
