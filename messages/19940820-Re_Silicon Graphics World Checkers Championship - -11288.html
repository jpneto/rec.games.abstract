I disagree.  Dr. Tinsley was quite correct to resign the match, though it
was certainly very sad that he could not continue it.  Any match rules I've
ever heard of stipulate showing up for scheduled games, and allow a certain
number of postponements.  Too bad, but there it is. 

I think accusing the Chinook lot of poor sportsmanship is out of line.

I just caught onto this story, so if I'm misinformed then I'll
retract this but I must say that my first reaction is that
indeed the Chinook team deserves to be accused of poor sportsmanship.
I think it's perfectly honorable for Tinsley to offer his resignation
but the Chinook team should have refused to accept it and instead
arranged for the match to be held at a future date.

This has been done.  Tinsley has declined playing us in the next week and
has not responded to a suggestion of playing us in the near future (in
September or October).

Tinsley showed immense sportsmanship in ever agreeing to play Chinook
in the first place and certainly he exhibited supreme sportsmanship
(if not quixotic behavior) by agreeing to terms that favored the machine
(i.e. where fatigue played a role on the human and not the machine).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
As in a previous posting of mine, we were aware of the possible fatigue factor
and did everything possible to eliminate it.  Tinsley was very happy with
with the match arrangements.  Tinsley has said that the arrangements in 
London (1992) and Boston are far better than for any other match he has
ever played.

For the Chinook team to accept this resignation is absurd.
I, for one, would rather have my dignity and honour (as well as 
my self-respect) than to accept a resignation on such terms.
Of course, Chinook has no culpability - it's a machine after all, but
the team of humans who are behind it should be ashamed of themselves.
They've gained a title but lost my respect (and I'm sure I'm not 
alone).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
We did not ask for the title.  Tinsley made up his mind to resign the
title, communicated it to the powers that be, who then conferred the
title on Chinook and sanctioned the Lafferty-Chinook match.  The point is
that this was instigated by Tinsley, not us.

We <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> want the title.  We only want to play Tinsley.  Had we leg-
itimately won the title, we would have immediately resigned it and the program
would have probably been retired. As it is now, we are in Boston with an
event that has been organized and paid for.  We did not want to play Lafferty,
but were convinced to because it is in the best interest of everyone that
the event continue.

We are making every attempt to reschedule the matchs with Tinsley.  Tinsley
is the best.    The title is meaningless to us .  It only means something if
you win it against the best.  Imagine, for example, how Karpov felt in
1975 after "winning" the title from Fischer.
