There is more than one single possible definition for tactical depth,
game complexity, or whatever you would choose to call it.

1) It is the greatest depth of a legal path in the game's tree,
provided the game can be represented by a game tree. [Problem: a
game of infinite depth could be trivial.]
2) It is its class of complexity in theoretical informatics. 
[Problem: you need quite some maths to prove anything.]
3) It is the shortest time the currently supposedly strongest player
needs to find, understand, and apply a perfect solution. [Problem:
games might require much more than just a lifetime.]

Further problems exist. E.g., how do you measure tactical complexity
of social competence or of infinitely many states of a ball in a ball
game [if we are kind enough to simplify physics]?

If you compare games, then first ask yourself about your objectives.
If your objective is to claim greatest depth, then choose a 
definition so that depth is great and argue in a way that nobody else
notices any shortcomings. If your objective is being objective, then 
explain everything...
