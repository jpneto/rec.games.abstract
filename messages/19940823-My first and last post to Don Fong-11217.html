   Ridiculous? then instead of posting irrelevant trivia, why don't
you address the issue that was raised.  Jonathan Schaeffer admitted that
the title had not been legitimately won.  Is it not poor sportsmanship
to accept a title that has not been legitimately won?  If not, why not?

Mr. Fong, you are not a very careful reader.  We won the title LEGITIMATELY
according to the rules of the match. [...]

   Who's being careless here?  Do you deny posting the following:

	``Had we legitimately won the title, we would have immediately
	resigned it and the program would have probably been retired.''

Your own words.  Now you're saying the win was legitimate *according to
the rules of the match*.  However that is a different sense than the one
which YOU yourself alluded to in the above quotation.  Which is the sense
my comment about sportsmanship was apropos to.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Look, under the rules of the match, the title was LEGITIMATELY won by the
Chinook team.  The rules are unambiguous and acknowledged by the rules of
the American Checkers Federation and the British Draughts Federation.
Jonathan's reference to the word "legitimate" was in the context that we
would have wanted to win the title by playing Tinsley (although our first
and foremost goal was to just beat Tinsley).  Perhaps it was a bad choice
of words by Jonathan, but I think everyone else on the net with the
exception of yourself understands what Jonathan was referring to.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
   Who's being careless here?  Your previous posts (apparently in response
to something i wrote?) addressed many "points" that neither i nor anyone
else raised in this thread.  (Were they raised in another newsgroup
perhaps?)  Such as the "adverse" conditions, and the propriety of the
Lafferty match.  I didn't see anyone claim "adverse" conditions, nor did i
see anyone object to the Lafferty match.  You also wrote a lot about the
current match conditions, whereas (IF you read carefully) my original note
referred to the conditions of the PREVIOUS match being favorable to the
machine.  It looks to me like you're just trying to obfuscate the issue.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't care what you say about the match conditions either here or in
London two years ago.  You were not at either venue so I don't know how
you can make any accurate assessment of either match.  We went out of our
way to agree to every request by Tinsley so we could ensure we could play
him everyday at his peak.  Tinsley was very happy with the arrangements
made both at London and for the Boston match.

Unfortunately, there are some people who will argue their point forever
and never admit they were wrong.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
   No kidding.  Also there are people who think they can win a debate
without addressing the actual arguments made by the other side,
simply by calling the other side stupid or ignorant, or by inventing
and then pretending to refute arguments that the other side never made.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

We are not interested in debating you.  Go ahead and have the last word
if you like.  Claim victory if that will satisfy you.  We just want to set
the record straight against the ill-informed comments you have been making
against us.  We have more important things to do than to waste time arguing
with you.  This will be my first and last comment to you about the match.

My experience is that they always must
have the last word.

   Hey remember, i'm dealing with a dude who claimed the championship
when his opponent defaulted. (:-)  Or do you deny posting the following:

	``Chinook is now the "man-machine" world champion [...]''

After winning not one game.

Kindly make one last post (your last word on the
subject) and then move on to other (presumably) more important things
in your life.

   I can see the world championship has gone to someone's head.

These words speak loudly enough.  But not about Jonathan though...
