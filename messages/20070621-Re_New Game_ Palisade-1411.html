Hi Bertram.  Thank you for your comments.  I did change the opening
setup to be an empty board.  Unfortunately though Palisade developed a
problem.  Play becomes more and more defensive with advancing skill.
Players create diamond patterns across the board, and it ends up being
an automatic win for black.  White has a huge burden of either
creating a loop with an unoccupied point in it or capturing a black
stone.  Unlike Hex, where you can set up multiple opportunities for
connections, in Palisade that strategy is very easy to foil, and you
still end up with the diamond patterns.  I don't know if I'd call it
flawed, but at best its quality of gameplay is way below the standard
I set for my games, and I have withdrawn it.

On the bright side, Dipole is turning out to be a very high quality
game, probably my best ever.  It's played in real time at
boardspace.net, asynchronously at superdupergames.org, and is due to
come out this weekend on a very large site, although I can't reveal
which site until after it comes out.

Tanbo, my first Go set game has stood the test of time, and came
online last week at ItsYourTurn.com, a huge site, where you can play
as many games simultaneously as you want.  There's an endless supply
of willing opponents.

I always keep challenges open as MarkSteere at all of these sites if
you're interested in playing.

I like this game. It features a small asymmetry between the two
players due to the corners, which is quite fascinating.

I'd suggest playing it on a smaller board though. At least in my
experiments, I never created wide cycles, except by accident; most
moves were close to the border or other stones on the board. As
a result, a game on a 19x19 board takes quite long. The character
of the game is preserved, I think, on 13x13 and even 9x9 makes an
interesting game.

It's also possible to play without any initially placed stones.
The rule is that the corners (and the hoshi points, at least for
9x9 and 19x19) belong to black. I suspect that this doesn't affect
the game play very much either, but I may be wrong.

Bertram
