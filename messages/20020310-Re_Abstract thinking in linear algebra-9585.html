To all in this message thread:

You sound like good prospects to me.  I have some abstract strategy games
which are not for everyone.  It seems that only math enthusiasts are really
excited by them.  WARNING: many of the general public get dizzy and fall
down upon light scrutiny of these games.

There is a positive correlation.  But there is even more evidence
that intelligence is multidimensional, and that people can do well
in one area without doing well in another.

There is also evidence that continual work is very bad
for the bright, and that drill after moderate mastery is
almost completely counterproductive.  If we could do it,
I would like to remove anyone who would consider giving
someone who understands something routine problems from
education entirely.

At best, it is that those who CAN do well at a calculus
course which emphasizes understanding and downplays
manipulation can also do well at abstract mathematics, but
this is not necessary, and there are those who can do well
at abstract ideas, not tested by intelligence tests, and
poorly tested at best, but who do nowhere near as well at
routine manipulation.

Those who can understand it SHOULD get through the whole
sequence with VERY little work.  And they should get a
full-blown real analysis course instead, with calculus
as an application.  Who needs to know how to calculate
derivatives and anti-derivatives?  Only theoreticians
need this; the one applying it can use tools.  But we
have many examples of excellent mathematicians who have
difficulty with such manipulations.

Understanding needs to precede manipulation, or only
the extremely bright can understand it.  Yes, the geniuses
can understand mathematics after manipulation, if they are
not driven off by the boredom, and if they are not also
driven out for low grades due to not handing in busy work.

    This seems backwards to me.   Manipulation is required by some extent

everyone.   An example here and there are essential.   I can't believe you
asserted that one could just "understand" without <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> context of
examples.   Surely your many years of teaching clearly establishes this
need.

But why subject them to the junk?  Even the moderately
good ones can learn mathematics faster without it, and
then learn the manipulative material twice as fast,
because they will understand what they are doing.

    I'm not sure I'm following.   Are you saying that somehow the
"understanding" is somehow just given to the student in the absence of any
manipulation at all?   You can't be saying this!

This is exactly the opposite.  We can teach abstract
mathematics, involving thinking, to children who can
just read.  Every year in the present schools serves
to stultify the innate ability to think abstractly.

    Too general for comment.   My experience is that if you leave

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Teaching reading by the whole word method, besides wasting
years, seems to have reduced or even destroyed the ability
of a substantial proportion of children to use the alphabet
to pronounce words.

The schools provide almost completely bad teaching; one
can teach elementary school children about the integers
from first principles, but after being told that the
integers are learned by memorizing methods of computing
sums and products, it is a major problem.  Preschoolers
understand grammatical structure; college students
usually do not.

    Hard to disagree with the above.

    Ditto.
