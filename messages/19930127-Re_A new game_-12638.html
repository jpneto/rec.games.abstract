   The board: A MxN rectangle of dots.         
   The play : Players alternate making moves, last one able to move wins
   A move: A move in this game consists of drawing a straight line 
      connecting two (previously untouched) dots. The line may not cross
      any previously drawn line, nor can it pass thru one dot on the way
      to another. Each dot can have at most one line touching it.

 Anyway, has anyone ever heard of a game like this? Thoughts?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

   Someone descibed a similar game about a month or two ago.  With this game
it's pretty clear immediately that player 1 can win on any MxN board if M
or N is even:

+   +   +   +
       /
+   + / +   +
     /
+   +   +   +

From here, any move that player 2 makes can be "mirrored" by player 1; player&gt;&gt; 2 MUST run out of moves first.  Is there a similar easy winning strategy on
oddxodd boards?

On boards with odd sides with no common factor, you can connect a line between
two corners with the same effect.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is rubbish.  A line between two corners on a board with odd sides always
goes throught the central dot, so is not a legal move.  This move is legal
(and the first move of a winning "mirror" strategy, as described above) on
an MxN board if (M-1) and (N-1) have no common factor.  However, this 
requires that one of (M-1) and (N-1) is odd, so one of M or N is even; so
this construction is less general than the construction above.  

There can be no simple "mirror" strategy on an odd sided board: the first move
touches two dots, leaving an odd number of dots, which can not be divided into
two congruent disjoint sets.
