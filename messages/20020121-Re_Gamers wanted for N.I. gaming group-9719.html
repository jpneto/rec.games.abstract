It was a pleasure ;).

Actually I have a few german made abstract games that I'd like to play
in the group.  I wonder if you have heard of them:

Ta Yu - pipe game
Tres - strange game with 3 revolving wheels and discs in two colours.
Aim is to push your discs into alingment in the centre of the middle
disc.

Also some german games are very abstract:

Through the desert - game about creating camel trains in different
colours, cutting off oponents and having the largest trains in all 5
colours - multi-player take on a popular abstract I can't remember the
name of...

Best,
Ivan.
