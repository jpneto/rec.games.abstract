some time ago a fellow student of mine told me about some game.
He told me that it was played on a (probably) hexagonal board made up of
hexagons. Each turn a player places a piece on the board (one player has black 
pieces the other one white). The object of teh game, as I understood it, is
to connect three sides of the board by chains of your pieces (like in Hex?)
or to make some kind of circle with your pieces (what diameter?).
My friend didn't remember the details any more.
I would like to know if somebody knows the exact rules of the game
(can one capture pieces? what is the size of the board?)
The only thing I have found out about the game sofar is that it is probably
called `havanna'. (I'm quite sure of that) And that it was on the market once
by Ravensburger (at least in Europe).

Havannah (by Christiaan Freeling) was indeed marketed by Ravensburger 
around 1981, but no longer available. The board is hexagonal, with 8 
intersections per side. However, the more interesting version is to 
play on a larger board, with 10 intersections per side. A small part 
of the (side-8) board thus looks like this (showing the notation too):

          \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
      3    * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - *
            \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /  J
        2    * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - *
              \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /  I
          1    * - * - * - * - * - * - * - *
                A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H

So, the intersections on the second row are, left to 
right, A2, B2, C2,.., I2.

Black plays first, players then move in turn. At his turn, 
a player places one man on a free intersection. (no men are ever 
captured). 

The first to form one of the three winning structures (fork, bridge, 
ring) is the winner.

- fork:   a group connecting three (different!) sides. Note that corners
          are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> part of a side!
- bridge: a group connecting two corners.
- ring:   a group enclosing at least one point (which may be empty, or
          occupied by either player)

          note that the smallest rings will therefore look like this: 
           o o          o o         o o  
          o   o   or:  o o o  or:  o x o  
           o o          o o         o o 
          The first has an empty point in the middle, the second a stone
          of like colour, the third a stone of the opposing color.
          Each is a good ring for white (playing 'o').
          As I recall, this rule was not properly stated in the first
          edition of Wayne' Schmittberger's book 'New Rules for Classic
          Games'.

ENJOY! 
P.S. I'd be most interested to hear from others having played this game!
