I love this change. In addition to the advantages you mention (which seem important to me, especially the fact that there's no crawling along edges anymore), it makes the the territory capture mechanism more thematically integrated with the whole: the game is about making chains, and now you capture chains of empty spaces, rather than just territories. That feels very right.

awesome.

Thanks a lot for your feedback, Nick.

I agree with your thematic argument and I'm positive that this is a clear improvement on the first version, but a certain consummate tactician with whom I've played a number of times, mostly before the rule change, seems to be uncertain about it (I guess he prefers bigger territories for his reading skills to pay off in a more dramatical fashion), so it's reassuring to know I'm not alone with this decision.
