This changes play in several ways: The squares next to a corner are

Except, the disk next to the corner is one of the ones being turned,
so its orientation doesn't matter.

There <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> some lessened degree of danger, but it's more subtle than
how you place the next-to-the-corner disk.  When you place it, you
can see (often) how the other-color disk further down the line is
oriented.  Thus, if you play B2 and flip C3 D4 (and you own E5), you
can see whether the opponent's disk at F6 is oriented dangerously.

Except, of course, that's not really the problem.  First off, if it's
that sort of position, you still have to worry that the opponent will
find a move that flips back one of C3 D4 E5, and he'll orient it to
point to A1, and then he can play at A1.  But more important, consider
how moves to the next-to-corner more commonly arise, especially edge
spaces like A2.  If you play at A2, it usually isn't off of B2 since
nobody plays there, nor is it usually a flip along the edge of the
board.  Usually A2 is played to flip in the B3 direction.  But if you
do that in your variant, then the opponent merely finds a chance to
play at A3, flipping B3 back, and now A3 points through A2 to A1, and
you can't even defend by playing A4 because A2 does NOT point there!

Anyway, I agree that the variant affects the game in interesting ways,
but not necessarily all the ways you suggested.
