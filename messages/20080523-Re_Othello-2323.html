I am a student and I have to do a strong Othello software.
I studied Michael Buro's reports, I implemented his technics using
patterns and logistic regression but I have still a 25-30 % of
prediction error, I think is too much.

Here are the vectors of my regression :

pattern1_value, pattern2_value,  ... , pattern52_value,  class

where
patternx_value is the Y+0.5/(N+1.0) - 0.5,  with Y=the number of
victories for this pattern, N the total number of positions where this
pattern appear

class = 1 if this position has a majority of victories, 0 otherwise

I use 13 differents pattern, and with 4 symmetries, I have a 52 vector
values.

Is it the good way to proceed, or I made something wrong ?

Othello is best played by a computer using brute force.  This implies:

 - Make a fast move generator.

 - Use tables for position evaluation.

 - Do complete end-game search using only win/no-win as alpha/beta.

The tables you can use are:

 - A table assigning values to edge positions.  There are 3^8 = 6561
   possible edge positions in one row, so this table is not very
   large.  You can let a table assign values to two-deep edge
   positions (edge row + next row in), which has 3^16 = 43 million
   positions.  This easily fits in RAM on a modern computer.  Let a
   program analyse all possible positions offline to build the
   table. Use the following strategy to build the table:

     1. Assign value to positions with no empty spaces as just the
        difference between white and black pieces.

     2. For positions with N empty spaces (starting with N=1 and
        moving up), let value be determined by the values of positions
        reachable in one move (by placing a piece in one empty space).

 - Use a table of exceptions.  Let the computer play a large number of
   games (against itself or other programs) using, say, four-deep
   search.  If the evaluation of a position using four-deep search is
   markedly different from the evaluation using no search (leaf-node
   evaluation), store the four-deep value in a table using a hash of
   the board position as index.  An exception table can make an
   opening library superfluous.

So, in the end-game you do complete search and before this, you do an
N-deep alpha-beta search where you evaluate each leaf-node position in
the following way:

  1. Hash the position and look in the exception table.  If the
     position is there, use the stored value.

  2. Otherwise, look up all four edge positions in the edge table and
     adding up the results.  Do not attempt to be more intelligent
     than that.

For the alpha-beta search, evaluate each possible next position using
leaf-node evaluation and sort the possible moves by this score.  Then
search the next positions in this order.  If the returned value is
markedly different from the leaf-node evaluation, add the current
position to the exception table.
