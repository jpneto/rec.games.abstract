Nice set of constraints to work with.  Though I'm not sure that the
game tree is actually very big in practice, because of the small
branch factor combined with the forward-only movement.  I'd wager that
the tree is small compared to many other games.

I tend to agree, though not for the same reasons.  The size of the game
tree is determined by the number of reachable positions in the game.
The branch factor is not relevant for the size of the game tree (if you
measure only the number of nodes, which is typically the case), but the
forward-only moves are, since they restrict where each individual piece
can be.  For example, the top-left red piece can be in only 12 different
positions on the board plus one off the board, and no piece can be in
more than 24 different squares.  You do have ordering on pieces in the
same square, but on the other hand two red pieces are interchangeable,
so I expect this to even out, so I expect around 10^22 different
positions.  This is more than you can store on a computer, but not a lot
compared to many other games.

For example, Othello/Reversi is considerd having a small game tree, and
it has around 10^28 positions (according to
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity</a>).  Compare to Chess with
10^60 positions and Go with 10^171 positions.

I once suggested a variant of Othello where each piece has a cross on it
which can be oriented either as and X or as a + (which influences in
which directions it can be the endpoint of a flip) and where the player
that places or flips a piece decides the oriention.  This will greatly
increase the size of the game tree, as each square now has five
different possible values instead of three.  It also greatly increases
the branching factor, which was the primary concern: Othello is great
for computers due to the low branching factor (which makes deep
brute-force search possible), so by increasing this, I hoped to bring
humans into the competition again.

One of the things that limit Draughts and Basic is that only the black
squares are used.  If you allow also moves directly forward, you will
greatly increase the number of positions.  If you also increase the
number of pieces per side, this will further increase the tree size.  A
possible rule that could keep the game interesting is that you are
allowed to move a piece directly forward if you also move another piece
directly backwards.  This removes the extreme simplicity, though.
