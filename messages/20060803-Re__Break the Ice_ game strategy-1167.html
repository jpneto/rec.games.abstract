It sounds like you're missing the "transposition cache"
(memory, e.g. hash table, of previously solved positions).
That will give you a huge performance boost, I think, though
perhaps not as huge as you'll need and could obtain with
further heuristics.

Depth-first is far simpler to code than breadth-first but,
if you pursue the project very far, you're likely eventually
to want breadth, so set up your data with that in mind!
