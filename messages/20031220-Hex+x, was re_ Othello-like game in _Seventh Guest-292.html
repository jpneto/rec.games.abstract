  Not to be confused with Piet Hein's "Hex," which is completely
different. (-:

  New game for analysis by those into that sort of thing:
Hex+x.  Moves are taken as in two-X Hexx, placing a new contiguous
piece or else jumping a single piece 2 hexes (in a straight line).
The goal, however, is to connect your two sides of the game board,
as in one-X Hex.  Flipping adjacent opposing pieces may be allowed,
or not, whichever makes for a more interesting game.
  Unanalyzed setup-puzzle: Who wins a game of Hex+x on this 4x4
rhombic board, and how?  (Assume no flipping, obviously; and
X moves first.)
