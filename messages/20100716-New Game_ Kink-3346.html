N-in-a-row games present a stiff design challenge because they've been
done to death.  They're even more challenging for me because I don't
like them.  Though I respect N-in-a-row games for the simplicity and
intuitiveness (they really do possess an exemplary degree of both),
they're way too tactical.  They feel robotic and shallow.  I want
strategic scope.  Though I've worked out half a dozen designs on
paper, all aimed at increasing strategic scope, I've not tested/
developed any till now.

Then last night I got a breather from my nasty workload, and tried out
what I thought might be my best idea on a whim. It worked!  Well!  So
now I'm going to talk about it.

So my goal was to create a more strategic N-in-a-row game, but it must
also:

1.  preserve the primary qualities of simplicity and intuitiveness.
2.  preserve the spirit of N-in-a-row games, whatever that means.
It's gotta possess a certain N-in-a-row-iness
3.  be novel.

It's hard to satisfy #1 and #3 together because most of the really
simple N-in-a-row variations are already covered.

It's also hard to make the game more strategic while satisfying #2,
because a shift in the balance between tactics and strategy can
transform a game's spirit.

That said, the new game is called Kink.  The idea is simple: it's a
basic N-in-a-row game where the row is allowed to have a single bend
in it.  Put another way, the row can change direction once, anywhere
along it's length.  The angle of the bend formed can be acute, right,
or obtuse.

The introduction of a Kink has two effects which I believe will make
the game richer and more strategic (consistent with my experience of
the first few plays):

1.  The number of degrees of freedom in the winning pattern is much
higher for Kink than for the equivalent standard N-in-a-row game.
2.  The number of stones in a row required for winning must be larger.

To write the rule set, I modified the rules to Connect 6, which is to
my mind the most canonical (and one of the best) N-in-a-row games.
Here you go:

Kink is a game for 2 players, played with a Go set.

1.  The board begins empty.  One player owns the black stones and the
other owns the white.
2.  To begin, Black places a single stone on any empty space.
3.  From then on, starting with White, each player places 2 stones per
turn.
4.  The first player to form a row of 10-in-a-row wins.  The row may
have a Kink in it.

Nice and short, right?

Note: I don't yet know if 10 is the right number.  Could be 9, 11, or
something else.  Play with it and report back here with insight.
