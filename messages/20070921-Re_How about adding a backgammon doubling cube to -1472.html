I was wondering what people's thoughts were about adding a backgammon
style doubling cube to abstract strategy games they play.

The idea:   ....  ....
3. If player asks opponent to resign, and opponent agrees, then their
opponent resigns.
4. If opponent doesn't resign, then points for game are doubled.

In my backgammon days, I often thought that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>doubling<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the stakes
was too much.  It meant that too quickly, a series could be decided
by one key match, and all the others became more or less irrelevant.
Even playing fo money, the same applied.

Thus, I thought, a good idea would be a one-and-a-halfing cube,
a  sesqui-cube, rather than a doubling cube.  Starting with a basic
stake of 4 points, the cube would subsequently turn it to
6, 9, 13, 19, 27, 40, 60 etc.  (Rounding down; not really important.)
Never got to try it though.

As to the matter of gammons and their equivalents, many abstract
games already have "degrees" of winning.  For example in my recent
game "Majorities" (qv), one may merely win by getting 2 of 3
directions,
or one might get a "super-win" by winning all three.  Even in chess
(or variants) there might be "wins" by checkmate, stalemate, or
merely by drawing with black.  Or, one might have semi-wins
which are draws with more material left standing, at the end.

The possibilities are numerous.

But yes, I like the idea of playing game-series with a doubling-cube.

Girls are better than boys at video games,
                                                  because girls have
larger 'buttons'.
Boys are only good at vintage games,
                                        because these are controlled
by joysticks.
