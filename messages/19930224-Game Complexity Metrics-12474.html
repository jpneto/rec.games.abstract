There has been much discussion on this group recently about the
"complexity" of a game.  The goal of this note is to start a
discussion about the important dimensions along which games could be
echaracterised, as they are related to the complexity of a game.

In their paper "Which games will survive" (Heuristic Programming in
Artificial Intelligence: The Second Computer Olympiad, ed. Levy and
Beal; Ellis Horwood, 1991), Victor Allis and H.J. van den Herik rank a
set of games along the following dimensions:
1. Search Complexity
2. Decision Complexity

Search Complexity relates to properties like the branching factor and
number of possible positions.  Decision Complexity is much less
precise, but has to do with the likelihood that a game (or some set of
positions within it) could be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>solved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> even in spite of a high search
complexity.  As an example of low decision complexity, they imagine a
simplified version game of GO, which I will call TRIVIAL-GO, with the
following rules:

0. The game is played on a 19x19 GO board. 
1. Two players move in turn, starting with White.
2. For his move, a player may either <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>pass<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, or place a stone of his
color on an empty square.
3. The first player to have 181 stones on the board wins. 

While this game has roughly the same search complexity as GO, it is
obvious that a player should never pass, and that WHITE wins by always
placing a stone.  

Thus, it is clear that some measure in addition to search complexity
is necessary to characterize our intuive notion of game complexity.
Unfortunately, Decision Complexity has so far only been motivated by
example.  Instead I would like to find some game complexity measures
which are quantifiable, so that I could write a program to measure
candidate games along these dimensions.  I would be interested in
other people's suggestions for possible metrics of this kind.

To start the list off, I have thought of the following:

1. State Space complexity STATE(Game): The upper bound on the number
of possible distinct states which could be reached in the game.  This
could be based either starting from a specified position, or assuming
only a fixed set of initial pieces placed anywhere on the board.     

2. Avg Search Tree Complexity TREE(Game,X): Let two random players
play the game against each other until either (a) the game ends, or
(b) X moves are played, for fixed X.  S_AVG(Game,X) is mean of the
probability distribution of the average branching factor for the
player on move, averaged over all positions in the game.  If we let
the programs play more games, this gives a tighter distribution.

3. Rule Complexity RULE(Game,L): 
The length of the smallest representation of the rules of the game in
a pre-specified game description language L.  Different choices of L
yield different rule complexities.  This brings up the question: "what
does it mean for some set of rules to be a representation of a game?"
I'll defer answering this question for this article, assuming that we
can agree when a program is really playing the game by the right
rules.   

4. Minimum Game Length LENGTH(Game)
The minimum number of moves necessary to reach a terminal position in
the game, if both players cooperated to achieve this end.   
Note that this problem is NP-Complete for symmetric chess-like games,
and NP-Hard in general.  


This list is still missing something which really corresponds to
Decision Complexity.  However, it does allow us to make some
interesting characterizations of games:

o Chess on an 8x8 board vs Chess on a 10x10 board: Both have the same
RULE and LENGTH complexities, while the larger version has much higher
STATE and TREE complexities.

o Chess vs. Checkers: Checkers has higher LENGTH complexity, but chess
is higher on all other dimensions. 

o Chess vs. Chinese-Chess: Pretty similar on all dimensions, but
chinese probably has somewhat higher RULE complexity for describing
the hopping capture movement for the Cannon.  

o GO vs. Trivial-Go: Similar LENGTH, STATE, and TREE complexities, but
GO has much higher RULE complexity for describing the capturing and ko
rules.
