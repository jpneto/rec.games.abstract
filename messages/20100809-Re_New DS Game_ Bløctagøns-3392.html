I forgot to mention.  Although google docs is proving to be quite nice
so far as a sandbox for new games (especially with odd shaped boards)
I'd be happier to see it on a gaming place with a community, a timer,
game stats, etc..., such as <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com">www.iggamecenter.com</a> so if you feel
inclined to give it a thumbs up on the 'proposed iggamecenter games'
list I wouldn't argue that you shouldn't ;-)

I might as well mention something not so elegant about the gameplay.
After building a bridge over a blank octagon that blank octagon is
still open for the taking although it will still of course remain
under the bridge.

If it wasn't available to take then bloctagons could end in a draw.

On a physical set I suppose that means that you'd have to take off the
bridge, put your octagon down and then replace the bridge.

I'd imagine there are many games which in concept have nice mechanics,
but aren't realized simply because they didn't translate well into a
physical set.  Playing on a torus comes to mind.  I'd prefer to play
on (in :)) an actual donut shaped torus than it's flat topological
equivalent for example although making one which could be reusable
sounds like it might pose a problem... hmm... a swimming pool inner
tube and a whiteboard marker might work :D
