I once suggested a variant where you start by taking turns to place a
number of tokens on empty squares on the board (though not next to the
midlle four squares). The game is then played normally. A token blocks
the square in which it is placed, so no move on that square is
possible. A token is colourless, so it works like the edge of the
board.

This works best on a larger board, e.g. a 10x10 board.

Another variant will make complete search by computer more difficult:
Each disk has a cross marked on both sides. A disk can be oriented so
the cross is either like an 'x' or like a '+'.  When placing a disk,
the same-colour disk at the other end of a line must be aligned such
that one of the arms of the cross points in the direction of the line.
Otherwise, that line isn't turned over. The new disk must also be
placed such that an arm points in the direction of the line that is
turned. Hence, a new disk turns either horisontal and vertical lines
or diagonal lines and, similarly, a disk already on the board allows
turning of lines in only four of the 8 directions. The disks that are
turned over are oriented by choice of the player who does the turning.

This changes play in several ways: The squares next to a corner are
not as dangerous, as the disks placed there may be turned to so they
don't allow the other player to us it to play in the corner. Also, a
corner that is won by a diagonal move can not be used to conquer the
edge. Additionally, the number of possible moves increase, as each
turned disk can be oriented two ways. So, if you turn 5 disks, you
have 32 possible ways of orienting them. On the other hand, there will
be fewer squares where legal moves are possible, so it is more likely
that a player passes and that the game ends before all squares are
filled.

Fascinating!  Have you tried this?  Do you have any sample games to share with
us?  Also, does anyone out there think that it could be implemented with the
Zillions engine?
