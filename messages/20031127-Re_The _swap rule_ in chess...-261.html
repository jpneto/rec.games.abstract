I really don't understand that attitude.  I can see how people can get
annoyed by `grandmaster draws' (i.e., games where both sides are clearly
aiming for a draw from move one, and all the pieces have been exchanged
off by move 20 and the draw is rapidly agreed) but apart from that, I just
don't see why people get so fixated on the idea that there has to be a
winner.

Apparently, this argument apparently comes up here fairly regularly and
neither of us is going to change the other's opinion by arguing about it
so I'm not going to say any more.
