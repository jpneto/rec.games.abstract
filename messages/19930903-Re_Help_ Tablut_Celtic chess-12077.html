To capture a warrior, the opponent must put 2 warriors on the sides of
the former. If a warrior is aside a corner square, it counts as an
opposite warrior. What is imprecise with the rules is whether the 2
warriors should be at the opposite of the captured warrior (i.e. the
three form a line), or if the fact that any 2 warriors aside an
opponent suffice to capture the latter.

 Is this the first occurence of this set of rules?  I have seen several games,
both board and computer using the same rules.  The only difference being the
size of the board and the number of pieces on each side.  Well, the story
given is generally different too.  I can't believe that it is by sheer
coincidence that so many games can exist with this same set of rules.  So does
anyone know if this was the first game to use these rules, and if not, what is?

  My vote would be for an old African game called Alquerque (at least,
  that's what I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>remember<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it being called), &amp; I'll take a stab at the rules
  (note: I played this last about 6 years ago, so...)
  The play is on a 5x5 board; each side (black, white) has 12 pieces. The
  game proceeds in 2 phases: a placement phase and a movement phase. During
  the placement phase, the players alternate placing a piece on any
  unoccupied square until all pieces are on the board. Then the movement
  phase starts; each piece is capable of moving like a chess rook, but
  only 1 square, and captures occur as described above.

The game you describe is called "Seega" or "Seejah" (I have a set).
"Alquerque" is described by R. C. Bell in Vol. 1 of his book, and is a
jumping game.  The game that the original poster is describing definitely
sounds like Tablut, although it's not identical to the descriptions I've
seen.  I doubt that the two games are related in any way, as the Tafl
group (Tablut, Hnefatafl, etc.) seems to have originated in northern
Europe, but I don't know if anyone knows for sure
