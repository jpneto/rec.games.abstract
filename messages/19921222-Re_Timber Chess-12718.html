(the "ko" rule in Go is its "defect" and has had an accidental
side effect of creating a very nice feature, the ko-fight.

I vehemently deny that the ko rule is a defect. Without it, a "ko fight"
would consist of hour upon hour of replaying the exact same moves over
and over until one of the players got bored, tired, or fell over dead.
All the ko rule states is that a move which exactly recreates a previous
position is illegal... is that wrong?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

hey, i'm not saying the ko is bad.  the ko-fight aspect of go is a truly
remarkable effect - a very nice feature, something i use to advertise the
game to others....           :-)

what i mean by "defect" is a patch on the rules to prevent an undesirable
effect from occuring.  you could almost say that anytime you can describe
a rule with the word "except", you have a defect patch.  a defect isnt
necessarily bad - some rare gems are only possible because of defects in
the crystalline lattice.

Do you also disagree with the
"three repetitions and a draw" rule of chess?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

usually i dont like games that can end in a draw, but i'm not disagreeing
with any of the rules for chess this way, including "en-passant".

It dates back to the time when pawns weren't allowed to move forward two
spaces on their first move. When they allowed the pawn to move forward
two spaces on its first move, they didn't allow it to escape a threatened
capture by an enemy pawn that way,

                                    yes i understand that - but why?  why
did they decide that way?  what was the pro/con thinking there.  here is
a great game in modification, and they first conclude that they need to
speed up pawn development (to fix some "defect", i suppose, of slowness) -
then they conclude they went "too far" and, to swing the pendulum back,
come up with "en-passant".  i just wonder what they were saying to each
other then.

by allowing the enemy pawn to capture as if the pawn had only moved one.
