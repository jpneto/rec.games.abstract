A noble effort, but I suspect this tripartite muddle of a winning

Fly in the sense of not being flawed, you idiot, as would reasonably
be inferred from the statements immediately preceding "here's hoping
that it flies".  Obviously Hex Hex Y was intended for academic
interest, eluding you entirely.  I couldn't care less if anyone
actually plays it.

I've got more than my share of playable games.  Atoll has been played
13,000 times since it was introduced at Jijbent last year.  Cephalopod
has been played tens of thousands of times at the various sites it's
been played on in the last two years. Altogether my games have been
played at least 100,000 times.  How many times have your games been
played, you fat piece of shit?

What's with all these aggrandizing adjectives you describe yourself
with?  The only thing "withering" about you is your breath, you booze
soaked buffoon.  Your stupidity is astounding!  Get off my coattails!!
