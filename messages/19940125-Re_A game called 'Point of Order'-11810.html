  Chris, the game you played is indeed called "Mao", though as you will 
 see that name is rarely spoken by players! It is similar to Uno, but has 
 a variety of somewhat twisted rules designed to make basket cases out of 
 its' players (especially those who combine it with caffeine). Here are 
 the basics:
 First the special cards:
     Aces -- reverse direction of play
     2's -- current player must play again
     7's -- next player draws two cards [unless they have a 7 themselves, 
            in which case they can play it immediately and cumulatively 
            increase the "penalty" by 2 to the next player] then plays as 
            normal (NOTE: if a 7 is drawn as one of the "penalty" cards, it 
            can be played, but does not increase the previous # -- it 
            starts over at draw 2 for the next player)
     8's -- Skip next player
     Jacks -- Wild Card .. the first suit that is called out by any 
              player (usually the current one but not always!) becomes the 
              active suit

  The game begins with the dealer dealing out 7 cards, which no one can
 look at until the dealer does so. He/she then calls out a players name and
 the direction of play (usually in the form of (i.e.) "jon's turn , mike's
 direction", though any means is acceptable), flipping over the top card of
 the pile at the same time. With this, all rules are now in effect (the
 only rule in effect before was the "no looking at cards before the dealer"
 one), and play begins. The first flipped card is considered to be the play
 of the dealer, and he/she must act accordingly (i.e. if a 2 is played,
 he/she must play again immediately). Then it is the named players turn and
 plays goes in the named direction (unless of course, the initial card was 
 an Ace!!!) [NOTE if the first card was a 7, the named player would have 
 to play another 7 him/herself to avoid immediate extra cards in their 
 hands!].
  Play is like Uno, where the object is to get rid of all your cards, by 
 playing (on your turn) a card that is the same # or the same suit as the 
 top card of the stack, or a Jack(wild). If you cannot play, you draw the 
 top card and play passes to the next person. That is where the similarity 
 ends, due to the following rules:

   ANY INFRACTION OF THE RULES CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE PENALTY CARD

 1. As mentioned, players cannot look at their initial cards until the 
 dealer does.
 2. Players are not allowed to ask any questions (except during a Point of 
 Order -- see below)
 3. Players are not allowed to swear.
 4. Players cannot say the word "Mao" (except at end of game -- see below).
 5. If a player takes too long to play, a penalty card is given (The 
 amount of time given is up to the group -- I've been in some games that 
 are "lightning" fast - very intense).
 6. Whenever a card that is in the suit of spades is played, the player 
 must call out "Spades".
 7. Players cannot play a Jack on another Jack.
 8. When a player has two cards in hand and plays one they must call out 
 "Last Card".
 9. When a player plays their last card they must call out "Mao" -- unless 
 they go out with a Jack, in which case they must say "Mao Mao" (in 
 addition to calling the suit and possibly spades).
 10. If a play plays out of turn, a penalty card is given.

 POINT OF ORDER
  At any time, a player may call out "Point of Order", at which time all 
 players must put down their cards (face-down). This suspends all rules, 
 except two - you can't look at your cards until someone resumes play by 
 calling "End Point of Order"; and if you do, you can't add the penalty 
 cards to your hand until play resumes. Other than that, anything goes 
 (usually this is called for questions and/or swearing!).

  Those are the basic rules -- whenever a player wins 3 consecutive hands 
 they can make another rule (whatever they want -- some popular ones are 
 "No names"; "No Pointing"; etc. or new cards such as Flashback 5's (play 
 goes to the previous player, but keeps same direction)). Strategies vary 
 from aggressive attacking/punishing of opponents to hardcore rules 
 monitoring. Don't forget, you can draw a card at any time when its not 
 your turn (either to stock up your hand or to trick somebody into 
 Following a Fool and playing out of turn!). Additionally, many people 
 play with two decks instead of one (more 7's!). Any way you play it, have 
 fun! [For those of you who are inclined, the drinking version of this 
 game requires a drink each time you get a penalty card!]. If anyone
