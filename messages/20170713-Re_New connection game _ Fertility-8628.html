It seems an interesting twist on the Short Circuit pattern for Nick Bentley's MindNinja. I quote from the rules, available on <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.igGameCenter.com">www.igGameCenter.com</a> once you start a MindNinja game:

SHORT CIRCUIT

The board must be full of stones, and the longest red "short circuit" must be longer than the longest blue "short circuit" [for Red to win].

A "short circuit" is defined as the shortest chain of like-colored stones connecting two stones of the same color.

This pattern was invented by Harald Korneliussen in 2008.

In your game, you have to choose the longest path between a male and a female, but I wonder if that's a good idea. If you have only one huge group, you can just connect your first pair by going through all your stones.

You have to choose between 3 males and females as pairs in some order which make the game a headache.
The idea of fertility was suggested to me be a recent comment of the french president Macron.
You are talking about invention of what in 2009?
You did not understand the core of the game.
