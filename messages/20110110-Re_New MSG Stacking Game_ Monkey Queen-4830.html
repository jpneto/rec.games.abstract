I've read through it this morning and mindful of Michael's remarks it
looks great, congrats :)

Thanks Christian.

Makes me wonder what your reservations regarding "gameplay-centric
design" were in the first place.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good question.  I got started with architecture-centric design 18 years ago,
with Quadrature and Tanbo, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Later, as I gradually learned that mine was not necessarily the correct
approach, I didn't have any alternative approaches.

Play testing is a big problem for me.  It exacerbates my depression,
something I normally try to keep at bay with regular exercise and, believe
it or not, laughter.  (Thanks Bill).  I also have an extremely low tolerance
for boredom, and a pathological aversion to anything even remotely
work-like.

Simplifying the rules as suggested seems all there's left

Agreed.

It doesn't seem to hard to implement at mindsports either,
given the amount of stacking games we already feature.
I'll ask Ed if he has a mind and the time to do it. It would
make a nice addition to mindsports irrespective of the
contest.

That'd be really cool  :)

I've given Soar an external thread to, and maybe Cameron
should do the same for Stax. I've also started a "direct links
to the entries only" thread.

Excellent.  Kudos to Daniel for starting the contest, and kudos to you for
picking up the ball and running with it.
