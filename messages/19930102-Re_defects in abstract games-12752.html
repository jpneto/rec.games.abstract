We could look at this idea of 'perfection' in abstract games as a form of
mathematical elegance, or we could look at it in terms of real-world
values such as ease of play, ease of learning, simplicity of manufacture,
physical beauty of the game, etc.  I the latter view, the argument
against the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>no repeats<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rule is straightforward.  But this rule, or
something like it, is needed to prevent draws in many games.  Is there a
way out of this dilemma?
 
Many people have referred to draws in my game SUSAN even though I have no
specific rule defining a draw.  I imaging the same same thing happens
with Abalone which also lacks a rule defining draws.  The no repeats rule
can be used to create the ko situation and eliminate draws, or it can be
used as a way to define a draw.  When is one preferable over the other?
Would Chess be 'improved' by eliminating draws?  Would Go be 'improved'
by adding them?  What makes these two cases so different?
