I hope this gives some insights.  I'd be interested in hearing if anyone
had specific examples where game theory was applied to bridge, especially
in bidding.

I once saw a book about a computer-designed bidding and play system
called COBRA.  It was intended to be used by computers in tournaments.
Apparently, when tested, it outperformed life masters in high level
tournament play by bidding at least as accurately as the life masters
did for almost all the hands.  However, it relied on some strange
counting systems (which included resolution down to the level of 1/4
points).  I don't know the full title of the book or its author.

Does anyone else know anything more about it?
