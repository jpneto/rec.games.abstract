Is this true?  Octi was also designed for this purpose.  What
are their respective dates?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I learned about Octi in 2001 through the Zillions site.
I've played the online bot and have gotten beat several
times.  OK, so Im not a good OCTI player, but try it yourself
at octi.net.  I think computers are pretty good at this game.

Don began working on OCTI in 1998 while he and his kids
were playing with Tinkertoys.  I originally began
working on a game that would be difficult for computers
right after the 1997 GK-DB match and restricted myself
to using only the material provided in a Chess set and
changing only the rules.  Don released his game in 1999
and I did not finalize the rules for Arimaa until 2001.
Even after finalizing the rules I spent a lot of time
working on the arimaa.com web site and did not release
it until Nov 2002.  I took my time to make sure that
the game would really be difficult for computers using
conventional AI.  I knew right from the beginning that
I wanted to offer a challenge to the AI community; otherwise
what's the point of making a claim that the game is
difficult for computers without putting your money
where your mouth is.

The main indicator of how difficult a game is for
conventional AI it the average branching factor of the 
game.  I don't know for sure, but I would venture to
say that the BF for OCTI is about 60.  This is
definitely more than that of chess (about 30) but way
short of Go (about 300).  Knowing that the BF is an
important factor in how difficult a game is for computers,
I intentionally tried to maximize the BF of Arimaa while 
using a standard chess set and keeping the game humanly 
playable. The BF of Arimaa is about 20,000.

Shortly after releasing Arimaa I learned of another game
called Havannah (mindsports.net) developed by Christian
Freeling that has also made a  similar challenge.  But the 
challenge is not as strong as that of Arimaa.  Im currently
trying to learn the finer points of Havannah and have
a postal game going with Christian. My guess is 
that Havannah has a BF of about 250.

The claim to fame of this title is that the designer is will pay
$10000 to anyone developing an AI that is competent enough to beat
people at it.  The game is said to be designed such that it makes
typical AIs for games ineffective.  The play mechanics are interesting
though.

The challenge is good til the year 2020.  I think around that
time even conventional AI will play pretty good just due to
the advances in hardware.  The main intention of the Arimaa challenge
is to get people to think about some new and different approaches
to such difficult problems (what do you do if looking ahead
many plys is not a feasible option).  If someone meets the 
challenge and along the way produces some break throughs that have
more general applications, I would consider it well worth the
challenge prize.
