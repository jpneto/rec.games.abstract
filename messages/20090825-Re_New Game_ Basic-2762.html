You guys both seem to be responding to something that wasn't written,
at least not by me.  Allow me to repeat what I did say:

"The design objective was to construct the largest possible game tree
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>using Checkers equipment<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (emphasis newly added)."

Checkers has 64 squares, and 24 pieces.  Go, in comparison, has 361
points and 361 pieces.  Do you really think I was hoping to create a
game tree as big as Go's with Checker's equipment?  Sure, the
stackability of checkers gives you a lot of extra mileage, but not
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> much extra mileage!

One of the things that limit Draughts and Basic is that only the black
squares are used.  If you allow also moves directly forward, you will
greatly increase the number of positions.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course!  Why didn't I think of that??  Oh, that's right...  my
pesky design imperative prohibiting ergonomic abomination.  Checkers
(the pieces) have evolved over hundreds of years to be about the same
size as the board squares, which is perfect given that only the dark
squares are intended to be used.  If you now use all of the squares
instead of only the dark squares, it becomes impossible to pick up or
slide a stack without disturbing the surrounding stacks with your fat
fingers.  Lovely.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You could be a bit more civil in your replies.  Your point about
restricting to Checkers equipment is valid, but your original post did
not mention such ergonomic restrictions.  Mentioning them now is
perfectly O.K., but please do so in a more civil manner.

Any other suggestions?  How about a game requiring 26 checkers so that
the 24 in the box won't be enough?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As Nick mentions, allowing backwards movement will greatly increase the
size of the game tree, as it will roughly double the number of squares
each piece can reach.  As far as I can tell, this will allow all
possible distributions of pieces on (and off) the board to be reached in
a game, so it would maximize the number of nodes in the game tree.

I can't see it as a complication of the rules, and it adds a strategic
choice: Do I move further away from my goal to block an enemy piece, or
do I move forward to get closer to my own goal?

If you also want to increase the number of edges, you can allow either
simultaneous move by two or more pieces, allow a piece to move more than
one square away, or allow a stack of pieces to move together.

Regardless, the size of the game tree is not necessarily a measure of
the quality of the game.  Sure, a very small tree will allow full
analysis, but even moderately-sized trees defeat this.  Also, there are
games with large game trees that are easily analysable (Nim, for
example), so to prove a game hard to analyse, you need to prove that no
"local" analysis can provide perfect play.  This has been proven for
many traditional games (by proving, e.g., that perfect play is in
EXP-time).  And even hard-to-analyse games are not necessarily
interesting: If the game is so hard to analyse that you have no
realistic way to judge if one move is better than another, playing is no
fun.
