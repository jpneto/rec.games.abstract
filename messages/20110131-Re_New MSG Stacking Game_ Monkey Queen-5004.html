Throughout the discussion there's the notion that games may be judged
not only by their merits, but also by a perception of the inventor's
character. I find that unfair towards a game, whatever game.

In the absence of games things may be different. The "former games
great Freling", don't bother to spell my name right, invented:

- Symple
- Lhexus
- Charybdis
- Sygo
- Monkey Trap
- Trounce
- InSight
- Jump Sturdy
- Grabber
- Cyclix

and a couple of derivatives since, last October. Not to make a big
fuzz about it, but that in itself is quite remarkable. All games are
solid representatives of my work and one is a truly great game, one of
the kind I invent for in the first place, but so seldom find.
I judge them by their merits, not by my perception of the inventors
character. Saying that Monkey Trap, InSight and Grabber are
'combinatorial quickies' and that Symple lacks drama (or it would
indeed have been a great game) can hardly be called 'delusional'.

But the first thing one needs are indeed games. So where are mr.
Taylor's games? Lest we only have his comments to comment on.
