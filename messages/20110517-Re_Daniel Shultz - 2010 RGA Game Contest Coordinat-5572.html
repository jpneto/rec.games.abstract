So, the ball is rolling pretty fast at this point.
Just a few more games to be played and everything should
be squared away by May 19th.

Sorry about the harshness earlier.  I've said that I don't care if I win the
contest and I really don't, but that doesn't mean I don't care if the
contest finishes.  I do.  I was beginning to think you were sweeping a
dropped ball under a threadbare rug and my response to that was essentially
disappointment, but not outrage.  I'm way too flaky to do even a tenth of
the work you're putting into the contest.  And it's not like we're paying
you for this.  It just would have been a major setback to have to start all
over again without you.

If it were me in your shoes, having to revitalize a lagging contest, I'd
bail on the contest and pull the plug on the Internet for a while.  A long
while.  I know that for a fact, so I wouldn't have any really grounds for
being anything more than mildly disappointed with you quitting the contest.

I think a lot of people are watching and waiting for the contest results. 
Not everyone is as vocal about it as Christian, but inquiring minds want to
know.
