Pacru:  <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.pacru.com">www.pacru.com</a>   3 abstract strategy games for 2, 3 or 4

This is to announce the first (mail order) release of a Pacru set under ï¿½100 
sterling, under 100 euros and under $100 US: the 302 Series.   Official 
mainland European release will be at Essen later this month.  North American 
distribution being discussed.

The Pacru set comprises 3 games using the same chevrons, markers and board:
Shacru - learnt in 2 minutes, Azacru and Pacru take longer.

Rules to Shacru and Pacru are on the website, Azacru to follow shortly. 
Pacru browser-based software (windows IE 5 and above) is available to 
download for free, or play on-line and it is intended it will be for the 
foreseeable future.   Shacru and Azacru should be available before the end 
of the year.

Pacru has received positive feedback on boardgamegeek and from players at 
the MSO games competition in the UK.

I claim the game Pacru is unique.  Yes you can find various single features 
in other games but nothing that could be reasonably described as similar. 
To be specific I would claim there are two different combinations (not 
mutually exclusive) of features  that each on its own would make the game 
unique
a)
1) the rule forbidding a piece to land on a square of different colour
2) the connection change
3) the division of the board into borderlands
4) the power of movement
b)
1) the rule forbidding a piece to land on a square of different colour
2) the way the pieces can only move forwards
3) the division of the board into borderlands
4) the borderland change

In addition to a) and b) Pacru also has two means of both increasing power 
in the game, and winning the game: the territorial capture primarily down to 
a) and b) but also piece capture.   So try the game out on the website, 
download it for free, borrow a copy, buy it ... and give your views on 
Pacru.

I would be happy to have the question debated here and to place all on-topic 
replies on a page on the Pacru website: I would rather that people 
considering purchasing the game can get an idea of what others consider it's 
pros and cons to be, than have any customers who have purchased an avacado 
when they thought they were looking forward to a kiwi fruit (personally I 
like both).

Cheers
