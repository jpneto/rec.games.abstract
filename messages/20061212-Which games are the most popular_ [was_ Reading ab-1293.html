One big disadvantage in attempting to master Nine Men's Morris, or Amazons,
or some of the other abstract strategy games you and others have mentioned,
is the lack of tournaments and players.  How many Twixt tournaments are held
regularly here in the United States?  How may hex tournaments?  At least
with backgammon and chess, (and Scrabble, too) is that there ARE tournaments
you can enter... there IS a vast library on the subject... there ARE a great
number of players who will be available to play a game with you both online
and off.

I think it would be quite unfortunate, in a way, to master "Game X"  and
then have no one to play with, simply because "Game X" is not a very popular
game.

This sounds like a pretty interesting topic in itself.  Which games
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>are<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the most (or least) popular?  Why is that, and how does it affect
the games we choose to learn and play?

Speaking for myself, it's extremely rare for me to sit down to a game
with another person (even via the Internet).  I've loved games all my
life, but I'm much more likely to be found studying a game, reading or
writing about games, or playing against a computer AI.

Yet, in spite of that, I still find myself drawn mainly toward popular
games--or games that were once popular (like Nine Men's Morris).  It's
hard to motivate myself to try a "newfangled" game like Quarto, even
when people who play it tell me it's great.  (As a matter of fact, I
have a Quarto game in my closet, still shrinkwrapped; it was a
Christmas present a few years ago.)

At times I've tried getting into checkers (draughts), but every time I
do online research or look for books on that game, I get the impression
that it's dying.  Fewer and fewer tournaments are held, fewer people
are playing it, and almost no one is writing about it.  Most people
think of it as a game for children or old folks.

Bridge seems to be a little like that--it's perceived as a popular game
of a dying generation, and it doesn't look like it will survive much
beyond the next generation.

In contrast, chess is still getting the lion's share of publicity.  And
games like go, xiangqi, and shogi are riding on its coattails.

Anyhow, it's an interesting phenomenon to me:  it's not enough for a
game to be good; it also has to be popular.  If it's not popular, it'll
die out (or at best attract a small cult following) no matter how good
it is.

So, which games are the most popular?  And how do you suppose that
happened?
