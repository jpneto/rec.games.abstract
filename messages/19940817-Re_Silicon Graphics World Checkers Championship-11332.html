4)  Concerning the assertion that checkers has essentially been
mastered by humans:  Yes, it is true that in practice strong players
will draw virtually all there games.  Consequently, current high level
tournament practice is start from a randomly selected position, P,
which is obtained by making a few random moves from the usual starting
configuration.  Games are played in pairs, with the two players
getting the opportunity to play both colors from P.

I read about Tinsley in the (printed) newspaper: He has lost but a
single match since 1955 (repeat: 19_55_), and that on a technicality
(tie breaker ruling). And so on ... An interesting personality.

Can someone please post a quick and simple explanation the notation used
in the posted checkers games? E.g., 1. 10-15 22-18 or 1. 09-14 22-18
etc..  And how do you determine what the "randomly selected position,
P," is?

(I guess I should go back and look to see if pairs of games begin
identically to position P and then diverge from move x onward.)

Thank you.
