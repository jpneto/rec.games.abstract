 When this group first came out, there was a lot of traffic about Nomic.  I
had a copy of the rules, but lost them.  I should say I had a copy of the
initial rulse, because the way you win the game is by changing the rules.  If
anyone has the rules or knows of a site to FTP them, please e-mail.

Here's an old copy of our set.  Most have been unchanged.

                       I. Immutable Rules

101. All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect,
     in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in
     the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins.  The
     Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213
     (mutable).
102. Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the
     200's are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted
     (i.e. changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be
     immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in
     the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.
103. A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment,
     repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment,
     repeal, or amendment of an amendment, or (3) the transmutation
     of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa.
     (Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all
     new rules are mutable.  Immutable rules, as long as they are
     immutable, may not be amended or repealed.  No rule is
     absolutely immune to change.)
104. All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
     They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
     number of votes.
106. Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is
     voted on.  If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which
     it was voted on.
107. No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
     explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have
     retroactive application.
108. Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number
     (ordinal number) for reference.  The numbers shall begin with
     301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall
     receive the next successive integer, whether or not the
     proposal is adopted.
109. Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules
     may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the
     eligible voters.
110. Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some
     immutable rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are
     wholly void and without effect.  They do not implicitly
     transmute immutable rules into mutable rules and at the same
     time amend them.  Rule changes that transmute immutable rules
     into mutable rules will be effective if and only if they
     explicitly state their transmuting effect.
111. If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous,
     paradoxical, of destructive of play, or if it arguably
     consists of two or more rule changes compounded or is an
     amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of
     questionable value, then the other players may suggest
     amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote.  A
     reasonable amount of time must be allowed for this debate.
     The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal
     is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and vote.
     The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative
     vote.
112. The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be
     changed from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.
     However, the magnitude of n and the means of earning points
     may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play
     cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be
     amended or repealed.
113. A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than
     continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse
     than losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may
     be imposed.
114. There must always be at least one mutable rule.  The adoption
     of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.
115. Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule
     changes are as permissible as other rule changes.  Even rule
     changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
     permissible.  No rule change or type of move is impermissible
     solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of
     a rule.
116. Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule
     is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of
     changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set
     of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

                        II. Mutable Rules

105. An eligible voter is any player who votes within 72 hours of the
     call of the vote.  A minimum of 3/4 of the players on the up to date
     nomic list must vote within this time period or the proposal fails.
201. Players shall alternate in the order specified in the "players"
     file in the nomic account on Herman, taking one whole turn apiece.
     Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be
     omitted.  All players begin with zero points.  Scores are maintained
     in the file "scores".
202. One turn consists of two parts, in this order: (1) proposing
     one rule change by mailing it to all the players and having it
     voted on, and (2) the moderator, jcaristi, throwing one die (d6)
     once and adding the number of points on its face to the proposer's
     score.
203. A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is a 2/3 majority
     among the eligible players.  All fractions covered by this rule are
     minimum requirements.  ie. 6 of 8 is 3/4 and 6 of 8 is 2/3.  5 of 8
     would not be sufficient.
204. If a rule change can be adopted without unanimity, the
     players who vote against a winning proposal shall receive 3
     points apiece.  If a rule change can be adopted without unanimity, but
     is adopted by an unanimous vote of all eligible voters, then the
     players who voted for the winning proposal each gain 2 points.  Finally,
     if a rule change can be adopted without unanimity but is approved
     unanimously, the player who proposed the winning proposal gains an extra
     4 points.
205. An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it.
206. When a proposed rule change is defeated by a 2/3 majority of the
     eligible voters, the player who proposed it loses 7 points.
207. Each player always has exactly one vote.
208. The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive)
     points.
209. At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.
210. Players who have consulted on rule changes prior to submitting them
     must reveal (at the time of submission) the nature of such discussions
     (and the expected outcome of the rule's adoption) as they pertain to
     the following: (1) Play of the game or (2) Anticipated future rule
     changes.
     Those formally accused and found in violation of this rule are subject
     to a minimum penalty of one lost turn.  Other penalties are to be
     decided in accordance with the rules in effect at the time the
     violation allegedly occurred.  Point bonuses or penalties for the
     accuser(s) are to be decided in the same fashion.
211. If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if
     two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then
     the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
          If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says
     of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or
     takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then
     such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for
     determining precedence.
          If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one
     another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method
     must again govern.
212. If players disagree about the legality of a move or the
     interpretation or application of a rule, then the player
     preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and to decide the
     question.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be
     created by the insistence of any player.  Such a process is
     called invoking judgement.
          When judgement has been invoked, the next player may not
     begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the
     other players.
          The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a
     unanimous vote of the other players, taken before the next
     turn is begun.  If a Judge's judgement is overruled, the
     player preceding the judge in the playing order becomes the
     new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player
     is to be judge during his or her own turn or during the turn
     of a teammate.
     Unless a Judge is overruled, on Judge settles all questions
     arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including
     questions as to his of her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as
     Judge.
          New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges.
     New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which
     the players currently disagree and that affect the completion
     of the turn in which judgment was invoked.  All decisions by
     Judges shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit
     of the game.
213. If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible,
     or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with
     finality, or if by the judge's best reasoning, not overruled,
     a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first
     player who is unable to complete a turn is the winner.
          This rule takes precedence over every other rule
     determining the winner.
