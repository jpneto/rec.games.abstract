The offside rule[1] was added to soccer because there were too many
incidents of teams leaving a couple of players standing next to the
opponent's goal, just waiting to tap a long pass in past the goalkeeper.  
This was making the game really boring so it was outlawed.

[1] For those of you who don't know it, the offside rule says something
    very close in spirit to: at the instant when you pass the ball towards
    the opponent's goal, there must be at least one member of the opposing
    team (other than the goalkeeper) who is closer to their goal line
    than every member of your team.
