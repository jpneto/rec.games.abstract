My attempt to design Byg has clarified my thinking about the design
challenge inherent in Byg's win condition, which is:

The game ends when the board is full and the player with the largest
group wins.  If the players' largest groups are the same size, compare
their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which
aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger, wins.

I like this goal because it's simple, drawless, intuitive, easy to
visualize in-game and easy to know who won at game-end (it can often
be seen at a glance).

The difficulty of turning it into a game can be seen if we consider
what happens in the most basic game we can design: the players take
turns dropping stones without restriction until the board is full.

What's the problem? there are two fundamental actions in this game:
create a new group (by placing a stone non-adjacent to any like-
colored group), or grow a group (by placing a stone adjacent to a like-
colored group).  The problem with this simple game is that it's always
better to grow a group than to create one, and this leads to a trivial
game with obvious choices.

Ideally, I wish for a game in which group-growth and group-creation
are both important throughout the game, so that it's hard to decide
between them.

How to do it?

The present rules of Byg are one solution.  The Byg turn rules make
group-creation valuable, at least during the opening, by making it a
prerequisite for maximum group-growth at the end.  I've grown
disenchanted though. The game has two clear phases, where group-
creation is the obvious choice in the first phase and group-growth the
is the obvious choice in the second. There are delicious decisions in
the transition between phases, when it's not clear whether to grow or
create groups, but the phases themselves leave something to be
desired.

The first solution I considered was a hard limit on the number of
groups you can grow.

That lead me to the following rules for Byg:

1. The board begins empty.
2. To begin, White puts a single stone on the board.
3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn you may either:
    * Place one or two stones on vacant cells, not adjacent to like-
colored groups or to each other; or
    * Grow up to 3 of your existing groups by one stone each (you must
grow at least one group).  A stone connecting two or three different
groups together is considered to have grown all of them (at the end of
your turn, no group may have more than one new stone in it).
4. The game ends when the board is full.
5. The player with the largest group wins.   If the players largest
groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so
on, until you come to a pair of groups that arent the same size.
Whoever owns the larger group wins.

This works somewhat - it makes group creation less important in the
early phase, but the late phase remains group-growth only.  I decided
to keep searching.

Guiding my thinking was this key observation: group-growth becomes
increasingly important as the game goes on as long as the win
condition is to have the largest group at the end.  As a result, it's
important to give strong incentives to create groups late in the game,
but without making them the only viable choice early .  Tricky.

Grappling with this problem, I came up with the following game:

1. The board begins empty.
2. To begin, White puts a single stone on any vacant space, and then
Black does the same.
3. From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your
turn you may place as many stones as you have groups, up to three, on
any vacant spaces (you must place at least one). Except:
* You may not grow any group by more than one stone.
* A stone connecting two or three different groups together is
considered to have grown all of them (at the end of your turn, no
group may have more than one new stone in it).
4. The game ends when the board is full.
5. The player with the largest group wins.   If the players largest
groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so
on, until you come to a pair of groups of different sizes.  Whoever
owns the larger group wins.

Note that with these rules, you can both grow your groups and create
new groups on the same turn if you wish.

Now there's no cost to creating new groups late in the game (since
there's no stone-penalty for doing so).  This allows a natural group-
creation incentive to operate: groups will merge late in the game and
you'll have to create new ones to keep your group-count up.

In addition, there's no great cost to merge groups early in the
game,since you can create new ones on the same turn to keep your group-
number up to the maximum.  This allows the natural incentive to merge
groups shine through (up to a point) in the early game.

The dynamic which prevails is clear: each player's goal is to create 3
groups and stay at 3 groups (either by growing them without connecting
them, or connecting them and creating new groups) until the last
possible minute.  If 3 groups seems too low, you can change it by
changing the limit on the number of stones a player may add. Testing
will be needed to determine the optimal number.  I suspect somewhere
between 3-5.

I also don't yet know if there are balance issues.  I'll report more
enlightenment later.
