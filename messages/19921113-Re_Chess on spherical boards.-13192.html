A sphere is isomorphic to the infinite Euclidean plane. Therefore you cannot
map a finite Euclidean plane (i.e. a chessboard) to a sphere. Which is also
why you can never get a map of the world right: you cannot preserve distances 
and area at the same time.

The Sphere is compact and R^2 is not. Therefore you cannot find an 
"isomorphism" [=homeomorphism in topological terms] between R^2 and
the Sphere. Thus the need for adding the "point-at-infinity" a.k.a. the One
Point Compactification of R^2. Thus you could have map of the world minus
a single point. [The fact that this cannot be done isometrically is a 
geometric property, not a topological one.]

The sphere IS homeomorphic to the closed unit disk, if every point on the
boundary is identified. Thus the entire boundary "becomes" a single point.
This is another way to look at One Point Compactification. Thus, if you
have a closed unit square [topologically the same as a disk] with a chess
board pattern laid out on it, and said "Every point on the boundary of the
board IS THE SAME", then you would have a spherical chessboard. Thus if a
piece lands on a boundary square, then he is considered to be at every
boundary square at the same time. Thus it makes sense to talk about THE
boundary square. [this is similar to the Poles on a map being spread out
across the length of the map.]

Note:
1) One would have to create rules concerning how a piece reenter the
board once he has landed on The boundary square.  He should, in some sense,
reenter in the same "direction" and color as he left.

2) Notice that The Boundary square is both black and white (or neither if
you wish) since it is on both black and white diagonals. Issues regarding
this would need to be resolved.
