Nice to see you are still on the boil, and still on the ball!    :)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, I'm only "a little" on the boil these days.  Real life (i.e. new
time-intensive job) has cut dramatically into my time for playing/
designing games.  Boohoo.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
This game looks like a good one!  A simple but obvious,
even "canonical" idea - I wish I'd thought of it myself.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Thank you!  I don't have canonical ideas very often, so it's nice to
think that this may be one.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 And YES, I agree that
the whole Quoridor concept is one of the world's greatest
game ideas, or "ludemes".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good. We can remain friends :)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
To be fair, this is far more Quoridor than Chess; it is not really
specifically chessy at all - many games have capturing.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Agreed.  The only thing I truly love about Chess is the game's
objective, so I'm happy that I could import only that and nothing
else.  Capture-the-King is just so beautiful the way it allows for so
much variety in games: sudden endings, reversals of fortune, wars of
attrition, etc.  I think of Chess is a poor game made great on the
strength of its win condition.

4. On any turn in which you choose to place a wall, you must(may?)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

"Must" is usually better in this type of game.  We find that
otherwise "opposition" type situations can easily occur,
where neither side wants to move first.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Good point.  "Must" it is, unless some as yet unforeseen consequence
convinces us otherwise.

don't know what the starting positions of King's &amp; Pawns should be
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>guess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is, a little inside the corner borders, with the two
assasins farthest from their target kings.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This I'm not so sure about.  Putting them closer together has
advantages as well (attacks on King can happen earlier, and so
defensive wall maneuvers must start happening earlier)

I've not tested these rules,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It looks good to me.  Please email me with a start size and
position as above, whatever you think appropriate, with ascii
diagram, and we'll have a go.   One thing however...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Unfortunately, I don't think I have the time to play now :(
My life is keeping me so busy that even posting here feels like a bit
of an indulgence  :(  :(
If you get a chance to test it with anyone, please post so I can
experience it vicariously.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND, for this and any other Quoridor
variants - that the original idea that there be a limited number
of walls to be available for use be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely abandoned<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.

I strongly suspect this rule was introduced merely to save
the game makers some money.  It is highly artificical,
and the number of walls is completely arbitrary.  Having walls
in unlimited supply allows greater opportunity for player skill.
We have found in our played variants that it is far better.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I can't believe this hadn't occurred to me before.  [Smacks head].  OF
COURSE there should be unlimited walls!

As usual, you're somewhat ahead of me in exploring this region of game
space.
