Does anyone recall a game called TEEKO?  

I payed it as a kid, and recently found it (or parts of it) - a box  
of 8 checker-like tokens, 4 black, 4 red, each about 2 inches in  
diameter.  It brought back memories, but not enough...can anyone  
help tell me what the game is?  Am I missing a playing board?  Any  
clues would be greatly appreciated.

It's played on a 5x5 board.  The object is to get either four in a row
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a 2x2 square.  The players
alternate placing one token on any empty square, and if (as is likely!)
neither player wins on the fourth drop, subsequent turns consist of moving
one token to any of the (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) adjacent
cells.

There are 16 openings, corresponding to the subsets of {1,2,3,4}, which
describe determine whether your opponent chooses your nth drop position
for you.  For example, if you're playing "point the second and third
drops", then the sequence of events would be:
	1a. First player places a token.
	1b. Second player places a token.
	2a. First player says "point".  Second player points to a cell.
	    First player places a token on that cell.
	2b. Second player says "point".  First player points to a cell.
	    Second player places a token on that cell.
	3a. First player says "point".  Second player points to a cell.
	    First player places a token on that cell.
	3b. Second player says "point".  First player points to a cell.
	    Second player places a token on that cell.
	4a. First player places a token.
	4b. Second player places a token.
	5a. First player moves a token, etc.

In a series of games, I usually play that the right to move first goes to
the loser of the previous game while the right to select the opening is
alternating between the two players, but I might have that backwards from
the official rule.  (I'm doing this from memory.)

For more details, look for a book by Scarne.

In practice, it sure seems to me as though this game is "clearly" a draw
under rational play, and the only way to win is to capitalize on your
opponent's blunder.  Agree/disagree?
