It isn't just the boards. Strategy books are also almost completely

Personally I like to learn about games by playing them, but I do realise
there's plenty of folk like to read up on how to do better so fair comment.

Improvised boards are not good enough. They might be good enough for
me, but I'm just one person, and one person can't play a game on his
own. I need to convince people to try, and for that, the visual appeal
of a "real" board is essential.

Since "nice" Go boards are expensive a pal of mine looked into creating
some for our club via local laser cutting and etching services,
available via the Yellow Pages.  He got some fairly respectable ones
made up at a much lower cost than commercial equivalents.  This suggests
to me that in this day and age anyone close to a large town in a
developed country should be able to do something similar if they really
want to.  It remains the case that we're not in the realm of
unobtainable rocket science.
