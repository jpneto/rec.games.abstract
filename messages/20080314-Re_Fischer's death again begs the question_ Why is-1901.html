Imagine that I have an agreement with Mr. Richerby (both of us being
dishonorable people) so that whenever we reach a drawn position, we
agree to flip a coin and the loser throws the game.

We reach such a position, implement our plan, and I lose the toss.
Both of us are near the top of the tournament, so it is going to
cost me prize money today when I lose on purpose.  Sure, he will
gain a lot more than I lose, but that does me no good today. I don't
know the next time I will play him.  It could be years from now.  I
don't know that the next time I play him whether there will be any
money on the line. I don't know that the next time I play him that I
will win the toss.

You don't care when we next meet or what happens when we do.  It

matters is that, half the times you cheat, you win and half the times,
you lose.

It's to everybody's advantage, in the long term, to cheat.

What would more likely happen is a collusion of a different sort. I
will play aggressively with White to get an advantage. Suppose that
he sees a way to simplify into a drawish position where I have a
slight advantage but he can probably hold the draw.  That "draw at
best" line doesn't look so good if draws don't count as much. So he
uses his chess skill to come up with a different plan, based on
counterplay elsewhere on the board, etc.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You seem to believe that some position, White has `an advantage' but
Black can simplify to a position where White has only a `slight
advantage' and can also produce `counterplay'.  One assumes that the
counterplay has winning chances or Black wouldn't contemplate it over
the guaranteed slight disadvantage.  This is impossible.  If Black can
produce counterplay with winning chances from a position, the
evaluation of that position is `Black has winning chances' or better;
not `White has an advantage.'

If a draw is worth 0&lt;p&lt;1 points, it is better to accept a near-certain p
points than trying to get a whole point with probability less than p.
If a draw is worth 0&lt;=p&lt;1/2 points, it is better to accept a fifty-fifty
chance of a whole point than a certain p points for a draw.

Of course, the main advantage to reducing the value of draws is that
the game will become more interesting to play and watch!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Draws are only prevalent at the highest levels of chess.  We assume
that the world's top players already find chess interesting to play.

As for `more interesting to watch', well.  It's possible that the
extra burden of playing games out to the bitter end and not being able
to take a half-point rest in the middle of a tournament will result in
lower-quality play.  I can't tell whether it would or not but there's
no data on either side and all I'm saying here is that you can't be
certain that decreasing the score for draws will result in more
interesting chess.

Seemingly more significant is that you're removing the value of the
draw as a safety net.  With a half point for a draw, a player can
sacrifice a pawn, say, for the attack, with the reasoning, `If this
works, I win; if it doesn't, I'll probably be able to hold the draw.'
Reducing the value of that safety net seems likely to lead to more
conservative, drawish play.
