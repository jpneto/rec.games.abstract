Hi folks,

has anyone ever thought of leaving the world of procedural gaming and maybe
design a game, which is of a declarative nature?

If you don't know, what I mean by declarative in respect to gaming, don't
worry, I am still struggling to grasp this wholly new concept, too. After
thinking about it for a week or so, I do have some idea of what a declarative
game could look like and what kinds of things the players could do, which
they couldn't in today's procedural games.

However, since this is very tedious to explain, I would rather first see,
if there is any kind of interest in these matters here. Obviously a 
declarative game would have to be some kind of abstract game, otherwise it
would become too complex, so I posted this here.
