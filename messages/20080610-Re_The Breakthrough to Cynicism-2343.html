So "anywhere" actually means "anywhere in my own back yard"?

If it's something you want and are looking for, is that really too big a

In this case, his concern isn't primarily with finding a board and
checkers for himself for the game itself, but rather with how
generally and easily available equipment for alternate forms of Chess
and Checkers are, so that their popularity might increase.

So it's not actually a question of laziness on his part. I remember
checking around here in Edmonton, Alberta, in Canada, and even a store
which sold French-language books and a few other miscellaneous items
to the French community here didn't bother with a board for Canadian
Checkers, so apparently the interest in that game is limited even
among French-speaking Canadians. (Not living in Quebec, I don't know
if the 10 by 10 game is the usual one there, but I suspect not.)
