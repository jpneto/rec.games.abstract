Mancala is generally thought to have originated in Africa.  However, a letter
in the new issue of Biblical Archaeology Review (Jan/Feb 2003) claims that an
artifact found in Jericho and dating to the 7th millennium B.C.E. points to the
game's origin in ancient Israel.  Would anyone with a knowledge of Mancala's
history like to comment on this possibility?

I haven't seen the Jan/Feb 2003 issue of BAR but this is not new. I
think this annoucement was made already in 2001 (but not published in
such a serious journal as BAR!).

I take it as pure bullshit. As John Cartmell says:

Why should any alignment of depressions be a game? Why should it be a
mancala board??
As Ulrich Schaedler has shown some years ago, if two parallell rows of
holes can be a board game it is not necessarily a mancala game. In
Asia Minor, for example, Schaedler showed such patterns were related
to the Greek game of "Five Lines" (U. Schaedler, "Mancala in Roman
Asia Minor ?, in: Board Games Studies, 1, 1998, pp. 10-25)

Fiddlesticks! The Kurna (or Qurna) Temple graffiti were published by
Parker in 1909 (although his book dealt with... Ceylon!) and were
reproduced, with some slight "improvements", by Murray in his book "A
History of Board Games other than Chess" (1952). Since then nobody has
seen them! Some archaeologists with an interest in board-game history
have tried to find them but found only a few of them, and their
conclusion is that they cannot be dated with certainty. One of these
designs (reproduced by Parker and, after a drastic simplification, by
Murray) appears to be Coptic! Others are better related to Roman board
games... None of the so-called "mancala" boards have been observed!
All egyptologists say they have never encountered anything like
mancala in the rich Egyptian tradition of table games.
We cannot relie on such a poor evidence. 

In fact the earliest certain data we have on mancala games come from
Axum (Ethiopia) and would date from the 6th-7th century AD.
Archaeologists found there, during excavations, some 'gabata' boards
made with clay and easy to date with the context. According to
Pankhurst and others Ethiopia is likely to be the birthplace of
mancalas but this doesn't seem to have happened before the Christian
era.
