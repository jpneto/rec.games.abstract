Ed Dengler proposes Hnefatafl (sp?) (that's NEF-tof-ul, sort of) as an
abstract game with no flaws, and Nate Smith asks for details on what
it is.

Now, why I don't think this is an unblemished game.  First, it has a
nontrivial starting position, though I can get over that one.  Second,
the rules exceptions I mentioned above:  (1) no "attacker" piece can

"immune from capture" and "only need to surround him on 3 sides" ????
which is correct?  is it that if it werent for this rule the king
would have been immune, so this rule takes that away?  boy, that is a
defect.

(3) similarly, if the king is adjacent to one of his own men, you
can surround the pair of them (with six guys) and win.  This rule
really needs to be generalized, in something like a go-type way.

Nope, this one has too many impurities for me.  I second the nomination
of Go for the most perfect abstract game, with "mental jujitsu"
(the perfect-knowledge bidding card game) pretty high up there too.

a game without defects isnt necessarily good.  tic-tac-toe has no defects,
but is hardly a "great abstract game".

i have created a variation of the 5-in-a-row family of games that is
played on a hexagonal grid of dots.  you cover each dot with one of
your stones.  because there are only 3 ways to make 5-in-a-row, instead
of the 4 on the square board, i threw away the double-3 rule with a grin.
after trying this game out with several friends, the missing double-3
defect rule seemed to be truly unneeded anymore.  however, the complexity
- while still quite high enough for me - is still so far below go or chess
that this defectless game wont make my "great abstract game" list either.
fun though.  i have another game using the same setup that could be much
more complex....someday maybe.
