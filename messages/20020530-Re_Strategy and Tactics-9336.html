I've always thought of strategy to be what you do without making reference
to individual units/pieces in a game. Take chess for example: I could say I
have a defensive strategy, or an offensive strategy, or a strategy to
control the center of the board, etc. But as soon as I talk about individual
pieces, like what I like to do with my queenside rook, then it's tactics.

The same holds true for wargames. In Bitter Woods (about the Battle of the
Bulge), I can talk about what rivers I want to hold, what towns I'll give up
without a fight, or where I'd like my front lines to be by turn 4. That's
all strategy. When I start to say that such-and-such a corps needs to be to
hex 2014 by turn 3, then that's tactics.

Take go: my strategy would be how loosely I arrange my pieces at first, or
whether I immediately attack an opponent's corner, or something like that.
Tactics would be how I position individual pieces (making reference to the
intersections, for example).

It's all a question of granularity. I think the scope of the game counts for
a lot. What might be strategic in Bitter Woods is too granular for even a
discussion of tactics in Axis and Allies. So the game's scope is a big
determinant of what will be classed as strategy and what tactics.

Hope this helps!

There's an ongoing argument in one of the comp.games NGs
comparing games on their tactical depth. What irks me
is how both sides of the argument can be considered correct,
depending on where you draw the line between what qualifies
as a tactic as opposed to a strategy. In most games, movement
etc. is discretized, does anyone have a reasonable definition
of strategy vs. tactics for games that is more concrete than
the military version, hopefully one that makes arguing what is
tactical and what is strategic a little less fuzzy?
