I just wrote a coloured LIFE-program. It works the following:
Two (or more) groups of cells are put randomly in a 100x100 board,
where left and right side and upper and lower side are connected.
Each group has (in the beginning) its own colour.

I once wrote a two-colour life using just plain majority rules for the
colouring of new cells: the dominant colour from the 3 neighbours
becomes the new colour. Since there are two colurs and three
neighbours there will always be a unique dominant colour. If you start
with a random initial configuration (with random colours for every
life cell) you fairly quickly get separated areas of different
colours. It is, however, possible to make e.g. gliders that remain of
composite colour throughout. An alternative rule that will not cause
separated areas is to make the new colour the opposite of what the
above rules say. So three identical neighbours spawns a new cell of
the opposite colour, and a mixed neighbourhood spawns a new cell in
the minority colour. I haven't done much testing of this idea, so I
can't tell you what the global behaviour is.

With three colours there may be three different neighbours, so there
is no "fair" choice for the new colour. If there are four different
colours one can say that when there are three different neighbours,
then the new cell gets the fourth colour (that is, the colour not
present among the neighbours). I expect these rules to cause
clustering like the first rules I described, as (I think) will any
rules where majority causes a new cell of the dominant colour. I have
no results about gliders etc. remaining composite with all four
colours, but since any configuration having only two colours will
behave like the two-colour rules above, gliders retaining at least two
different colours exist.

With more than four colours we again have the question about what to
do when the three neighbours are different. I have no elegant solution
to this problem.
