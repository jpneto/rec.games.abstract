I program computer games for fun.  Basically, I never really used a book.  The
trick is to simply forget the big picture and concentrate on one tiny subroutine
at a time.  Trying to realize what you are doing can kill you unless you're
done....  
  If you want BASIC games, there are two books which actually show you code for
simple games.  They're the First and Second Giant Book of Computer games.
You can go on from there.
  Another thing: don't expect to be able to finish a game in a couple of days.
In general, it takes about a week to do 70% of the work, two weeks to do 90% ...
and then endless refinements...
  My first game was Ball Catching, a game where balls (letter o's)fall down and 
you have to catch them.  Only took something like 3K.  You can also do text 
adventures, which are not really sophisticated ("printf 
("Which way will you go?")").  If you have sophisticated graphics packages, you 
can work with stuff like Othello (you can play against a human or computer), 
Checkers, or Tetris clones.  There are also games like Mastermind and Roulette 
which aren't hard.
  Although most of my games are in Basic and Pascal, try to use C if you know it.
C is the language of choice nowadays.  Although I have never programmed games in
C (apart from VERY simple number guessers and stuff like that), it can't be 
much different from Pascal.
  Good luck!
