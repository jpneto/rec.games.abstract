You can make the same criticism about Chess: Players can just move a

Again comparing your game to Chess.  Chess, as we all know, is not

Are you serious?  It's not a matter of statistics.  What about two
Checkers kings chasing each other around the board?  Nobody has to
force a draw.  One way a draw can be reached is when both players
agree that the game isn't leading anywhere conclusive.  That won't
happen in a naturally finite game, because every move brings the game
closer to a conclusion.  Your options are limited: win or lose.

In the same fashion, another person with zero experience in the game

Torben, for the love of humanity, IN YOUR GAME, AS FAR AS YOU KNOW,
DRAWS COULD BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM.  WHY RELEASE A GAME THAT YOU WELL

With all this talk of substance, where's your substance?  Why are you
so convinced that draws couldn't possibly become a major problem in
your game?  Maybe the great, great grandmothers were right in that
defensive play is really the best play in your game, *again, as far as
you know*.

I did say that possibility of draws do not guarantee fairness, just that
it is a requirement for fairness.

Ok, Logic Man.  So you should probably be able to name one real,
playable game that has draws and doesn't have move order advantage.

Oh I'd love to see that.  If it's so easy for you Logic Man, let's see

The coin toss, Torben.  The coin toss.  The random selection of Player
1.   Contrary to popular wisdom, abstract games are not completely
devoid of luck.  The game is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>initiated<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> with luck, unless of course
it's your hypothetical fair game, which I'm dying to see.

No more so than arguments that say that games where draws are impossible
are inherently superior to games where draws are possible.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I do believe that, but that's not what I'm saying.  Chess has been
proven over time not to have a major problem with draws among beginner
to intermediate players.  When you release a simple abstract game
that's prone or susceptible to draws, i.e. draws can happen,
especially a game like yours where armies can butt heads in the middle
of the board and have a Mexican standoff, you don't know if draws will
become a major problem.  As far as you know, with a little experience
under your belt, every game will be a draw.  Maybe the Mexican
standoff is perfect play for your game.  Games are released like that
all the time, like Batalo for instance, etc., etc., etc.  After a
little experience, every game is a draw.  Ok, stay with me here
Torben.  I didn't just say that draws are guaranteed to become a major
problem in your game, ok?  No more straw man.  Logic Man yes.  Straw
Man no.
