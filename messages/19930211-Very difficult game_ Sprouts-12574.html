In case anyone's not familiar wth Sprouts:

Put n dots or "sprouts" on a piece of paper. Players alternate turns
trying to be the last to move. Sprouts are considered alive when they
are connected to &lt;3 others. Sprouts can never connect to more than 3
others. A turn is: Draw a line from one alive sprout to another, and put
a new sprout on the line. (The new sprout will already have 2
connections of course.) "Lines" do not have to be straight.

I believe that this is a well known game. Has anyone programmed a
version of it <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>with_a_user_interface<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>? This is one of the most difficult
games to program that I can imagine. If there is another game that's so
simple for a person to understand, and so difficult to code, I'd like to
know!
