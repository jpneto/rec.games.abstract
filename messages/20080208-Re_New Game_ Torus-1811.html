First I have to thank Torben Mogensen for both posing the torus
problem and for identifying the error in my first attempt at a
solution.  Bill Taylor also deserves mention here.  We've spent a lot
of time in the same neighborhood lately with him always arriving at
the intersections a step ahead of me -

Alas, the same can be said about your "Torus".

It is a game I considered some while ago, but discarded
on the ground that the two players had noticeably different
goals, of unequal difficulty.  The E/W direction paths
have a different (global &amp; local) topology from the N/S paths.
If one wants a game that's as symmetric as possible
between the two players, this isn't it.

Mind you, that doesn't stop it being a good game!
I've already mentioned the matter of Unlur style games;
essentially "Chicken" games where both players play stones
for the weaker side, until someone cracks, (Chicken!),
and takes the weak side, suspecting it
to be strong enough by now.

OC the PIE rule is a special case of this "Chicken" style;
where the two sides are equal in all but 1st move.

No doubt with a suitable application of Chicken Pie
Marks' Torus game can be made properly equalised.

The NZ game remains the best attempt at full
player equivalence, though.   IMHO.
