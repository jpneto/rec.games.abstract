Compared to traditional games, yes. But compared to non-proprietary
games made at the same time, I don't see much of a disadvantage.
Doesn't Twixt have more players than Hex even today?

IMO there's nothing wrong with going commercial, as long as the
inventor is reasonably reasonable on "intellectual property" issues.
There are many examples of that in recent years. My impression is that
commercial abstracts on average are better - when no money is at
stake, it's easier for people to just throw out a lot of half-baked
ideas. That may be a good thing, for designers who don't take
themselves too seriously, or who take an open and incremental approach
to game design... but I could name a couple of designers whose egos
could have benefited from a little market correction :-P
