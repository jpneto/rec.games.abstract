I'm not one, but unfortunately there exists many dishonest players.
It's a fact of life: everyone uses cheat codes. In chess, you can't
really cheat because the rule set is too clear and there's no
information hiding.

Actually, if you've ever played chess online ... there ARE cheaters.
They simply run some chess software in the background that tells them
what to play.

You're right :) I've often thought that someone may pull that move on 
me... what's the point of playing if you can't win on your own? Of 
course, you're talking to a guy that got beat in chess by a friend who 
had his back turned the entire game and played from memory... ;-)

So have I, but that just says how good the other guy is,
not how bad you are.  I can't play blindfold chess at all
myself, but people who can generally don't
play that much worse blindfolded than when they
can see the board.

The solution is that, if you "lose" to a cheater, you have simply
wasted your time. Take whatever enjoyment you had and leave. It's not
like you need to feel shame because you lost.

True, but the feeling I get from wasted time is worse than shame from a 
loss. At least in a loss, you may have gained by learning something from 
a fair game or appreciated the winner's winning strategy. Wasting time 
is just.... futile :)  (redundancy check-- survey says: 92% !)
