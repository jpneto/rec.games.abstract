is hampered by the fact that you could equally say:

"[Key elements]

games. These elements are: &lt;snip&gt;"

You could probably take out the "strategy" as well and it would still be
true.  So the start point and (presumably) most fundamental part of the
document doesn't actually help you with the stated purpose of defining
an abstract strategy game in a usefully exclusive way.

That's a good point.  These "key elements" that purportedly "define
all abstract strategy games" really apply to all board games and do
absolutely nothing to distinguish abstract games.

I would think if you want to do an academically thorough job on it you
should start with saying these are the key elements of a board game, and
further develop them to formally differentiate how the board, pieces
etc. of an ASG are differentiated from a non-ASG.

This discussion highlights a problem that's been ongoing since the
outset of these discussions on the IAGO forums.  (By the way Rich,
rec.games.abstract is a much better place to discuss these issues than
the IAGO forums.)  The stated goal was to objectively describe what an
abstract game is.  Absolutely no progress was ever made toward that
end and still hasn't been, even here.  A lot of subjective qualifiers
were suggested along the way such as "I know an abstract game when I
see it," and how long it would take a "typical" TV audience to
understand the game.  The few attempts at objective qualifiers were
immediately shot down.  Even the suggestion of excluding games with
random elements was quickly ruled out in favor of the absurd notion
that abstract games should include either random elements or hidden
information but not both.  (This is when the image of the hapless
astronaut with the severed tether began to formulate.)

I think the root problem is that it's impossible to objectively define
an abstract game.  You can certainly start with "no random elements"
and "no hidden information" (which would exclude simultaneous move
games.)  This would narrow the field considerably.  The problem is the
definition of "lightly themed".  That's subject to interpretation.
One gamer's lightly themed game is another gamer's heavily themed
game.  There's more gray area than black and white.

The listing of accepted categories was probably the most realistic
attempt to define abstract games.  You have territory games and
capturing games, etc.  But it's still really hazy even with this.  For
example, maybe Chess could be considered a "war game", an excluded
category, depending on how you define war game.  Or conversely a war
game might be considered a "territory game", an included category.

Another problem is all these separate lists.  There's this circular,
denial based argument of "Oh, this list isn't really for blah, blah,
blah.  It's only for blah, blah, blah."  Any attempt to explain the
true purpose of any of these lists is perpetually procrastinated.
There was the "top 100" list.  Top 100 in what respect?  Are these the
top 100 most representative abstract games?  That's akin to a top 100
list of most representative plants.  Either it's a plant or it isn't.
One plant isn't more representative of plants than another plant.  You
have to either include all abstract games or admit that it's only a
random selection of abstract games.  Or possibly a selection of the
most well known games, or the most well thought of games.  There has
to be some criteria other than the utterly arbitrary "top 100" with no
mention of a prioritization scheme.

I appreciate the effort here.  As a designer of abstract games, it's
interesting to see general discussions of abstract games.  But these
attempts to objectively define abstract games have only been sheer
folly from the outset.  It's fundamentally flawed, pseudo science
with, for example, a claim to enumerate key elements of abstract games
followed by an extensive list of key elements of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, with
nothing to distinguish abstract games.
