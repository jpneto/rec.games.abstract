Back when I used to see the English Bridge Union's magazine, the
bridge players had exactly the same concern (falling membership)
and an analogous "silver bullet" solution (simplified conventions).

Me, I don't believe in silver bullets (that's why I picked that term).

Did the Lone Ranger ever meet the Wolfman?

But I agree with you that there is not going to be a way to increase
the popularity of Chess massively through a simple rules change.

And, furthermore, a major rules change that creates a new game isn't
something that is likely to be imposed from the top. Instead, any new
version of Chess would have to gain popularity gradually, and there's
really no reason to expect any such version to get very far.
