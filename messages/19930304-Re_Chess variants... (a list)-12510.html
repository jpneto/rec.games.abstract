   Quite apart from the fact that chess clocks make bughouse the most
"exciting" chess variation around, there's a point to it even if you're not
into fast paced games (and you could always allow a higher time limit).
Often a person will be one move away from being mated no matter what they do.
Rather than moving right away, it makes sense to stop and wait, hoping your
partner will do better than you.  If your partner gets beaten too, it's clear
that the other team wins, even if he stalls and doesn't make the last move
either.  But what if he has a mate in one, and his opponent doesn't want to
move either?  Clearly whoever moves first loses, and you either have a
standoff, or an argument.  If you have chess clocks ticking away, there's a
tiebreaker and this isn't a problem.
   The game with four pawns and a king, with two moves to make up for the
handicap, is pretty deadly when played by the rules I was taught with.  I
don't know if the original poster knew a different version of it, or simply
didn't mention all of the rules.  In the version someone taught me (and
trounced me at, using the king and pawns!), the king could definitely move
into check, if he used the second move to move back out again.  Additionally,
if the first move was a "check" in the conventional sense, the second of the
two moves could be used to capture the enemy king, winning instantly.  Not
only the pawns, but also the king could do this.  So being two moves away
from the king was an effective form of "check", and the black king could
easily "mate" the white king without any help from the pawns, just by being
within two squares and trapping it against the edge.
