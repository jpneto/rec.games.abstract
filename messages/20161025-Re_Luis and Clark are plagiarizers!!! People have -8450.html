Can you understand that flipping the token of your opponent is nothing more than capturing?

You are too dumb to understand what is hidden behind the words.
Hitting someone for dumb people is physically hitting him.
Hitting with words or hitting the pocket of someone or pushing him to spend more money is not hitting for the dumb people like you or any other mean is not hitting for dumb guys like.
Now I`m hitting you slapping you humiliating you.
Are you aware of that?
No! Because you are like donkey!!! He needs to be beaten with a stick otherwise he does know what hitting is.
BIG ILLITERATE IS WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WILL BE FOREVER.
