That wouldn't be in the game's spirit. It's meant to be a quick
positional game with fairly obvious tactics. And I like the way it
moves, so I've solved it by adding four 10x1 sidebars that must remain
empty in the initial set-up.
Not unlike the Cage board:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/cage-607">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/cage-607</a>
(but checkered like the rest of the board and indeed part of the
playing area).
That should solve any of the anticipated problems.

9x1 bars (32 extra squares plus 4 corners = 36 squares/4 = 9 squares
each bar.  10x1 would leave overlap)

also, i don't know why everyone hates the rule freeling is using.
A.  with either rule, the player to choose has the advantage (if the
game is won, if it is drawn, then it is possible no advantage exists).
B.  under pie rule.  player 1 sets up an absolute position that he
hopes he has an information advantage on both sides of the board, and
player two tries to gain enough information to convert his real
advantage into a practical one.
C.  under the 'Marquisian Method' , player 1 sets up a visual position
(not a position because side to go first hasn't been declaired) that
he hopes he has an information advantage on in 2 of the 4 possible
positions, player 2 then tries to gain enough information to figure
out which of the 4 choices is a win, and to convert his real advantage
into a practical one.
D.  each method requires just as much planning (you have to choose a
position, choose who goes first, and choose who plays each side), it
is meerly rearranged when these decisions take place, furthmore,
making these decisions should take the same amount of time (since
player 1 comes in with a position prepaired, he requires no thinking
time no matter what player 2 chooses).  thus neither is harder to
execute than the other.

thus it can be concluded that the only difference between the two
methods is that player 1, who has an absolute disadvantage, has an
expanded information advantage with the 'Marquisian Method' , which
should be good for the game, as we want teh game to be balanced as
deeply as possible, and player 1 expanding his compensation for having
a lost position before the game begins is good for this.
