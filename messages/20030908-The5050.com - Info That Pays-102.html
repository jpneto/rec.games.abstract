Hello everyone, there is a new website that just started up last week
and is really cool in many ways. I am happy to inform you about its
new presence and hope that you will feel like subscribing after I talk
about it a little.

Just to break it down and give you a quick overview on what they do is
basically weekly newsletters. However the newsletters they send out to
you are pretty cool which contain a bit of news, horoscopes, a weekly
game review and lots more.

What is even more great is that they are running a weekly trivia
contest that gives you a chance to win their weekly prize that is
posted right on their main website, in the top right hand corner. They
are increasing this prize exponentially as more people subscribe!

For those of you who want to get cheap advertising out to lots of
people every week, then this may be a good opportunity for you. The
business section of The5050.com newsletter is ideal for putting an
article or some type of ad for little cost.

The5050.com knows that normal newsletters can be boring and only
promote single products and other related services to the one business
you are a member to. The people at The5050.com have felt exactly the
same way you have and wish to have a consolidated newsletter going out
to the people. Not only has The5050.com discovered how to address news
and information to people every week, they make it fun and potentially
profitable, which is why they say it's "Info That Pays"

Thank you for reading this message. If you have questions or comments
feel free to contact me about this posting. Have a great day!
