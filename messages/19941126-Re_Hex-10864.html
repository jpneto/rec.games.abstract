 &gt;&gt;&gt;Determination of the set of winning moves for 7x7 is probably too hard
 &gt;&gt;&gt;for me.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;I seem to recall, though, that you have solved 7x7 (presumably
 &gt;&gt;a win from the central position).  Is this correct?  Do you
 &gt;&gt;have results for 8x8 or 9x9?
 
 &gt;Yes, moving in the center wins in 7x7.  Jing Yang wrote out a
 &gt;proof with a complete strategy; it came to 20 pages or so. 
 &gt;The 2-2 and 3-3 points (B6 and C5) on the short diagonal win too.
 &gt;My program can play perfectly starting from any of those three moves.
 &gt;Probably there are many other winning moves.  It's MUCH harder
 &gt;o evaluate a borderline move (e.g. A4) then a strong move like those.
 &gt;I haven't tried 8x8 or 9x9 yet.  I wonder if on larger boards
 &gt;there are more or fewer winning first moves.

Isn't it possible to prove, in a more general way, that playing to the
center of an NxN board (N odd) is always a win for the first player?

It cannot be a draw, and having the first move cannot be a disadvantage
for the first player (since the game is monotonically increasing), so
it is a win.  All that needs to be shown is that playing to the center
hex is at least as good as any other move, which seems obvious, at
least intuitively.  Hex is a fairly well studied game, has any work
been done on this?
