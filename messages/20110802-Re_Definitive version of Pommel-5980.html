The captain capture is limited to the first empty square, no long
slide after the last captured piece.  Without this, and combined with
linear capture, I think captains would have been too deadly and the
game becomes a race to be the first to promote and then use the first
captain to decimate the opposition, a pattern I wanted to avoid.

Yes, I think you're right. Also, I realise that allowing the long
slide in jumps and not in leaps would be a bit of an inconsistency.

You are correct about the existence of cooperative drawn positions,
and I realize now that I should have seen this (wipes egg off face).
I believed that one side would always be able force a win, but it is
also possible that neither player will see the forcing win and the
game will not terminate.  It also now occurs to me that there can be
positions, albeit rare, in which there is not a forced win.

I suspect they won't be so rare, but the draw rate must be
dramatically inferior to that of Draughts, anyway. And that's a great
merit for a Draughts variant which preserves much of the freedom of
movement of Draughts' kings and even gives them an additional capture
mechanism.

Still, combining pure Draughts with the constraint that kings must
capture or move where they can be captured should also make for an
intriguing, truly drawless variant. As kings would be too weak, linear
capture (and even multiple linear capture) could be implemented as a
privilege exclusive to them.

By the way, I'm still curious if there are any drawn positions in
Pommel with only captains on the board. Your example position on a
triangle also applies to a hex-hex board, where two captains can
prolong the game indefinitely by drawing a triangle whose vertices are
three corner cells. On your square-hex boards, I don't know if it's
possible to use the same pattern by placing some more pieces on
convenient cells. It looks like a nice puzzle to solve.
