A few years ago I wrote a simple and stupid Teeko-program. It seems to
be a pretty  drawish game That was  without the tournament rule with
larger squares btw. Scarne apparently could beat all his tournament
opponents, but how trained were they? I don't know, but I'm guessing
it might be too drawish to stay interesting for serious players.

The tournament game has several additional rules which makes it rather
difficult to draw. The Fairview Teeko Club had many serious players and
draws were very rare among them. Your Teeko program doesn't proof
anything because it doesn't use the correct rules for serious play.

I agree that my Teeko program doesn't prove anything. :-)
But maybe I should look into re-writing my newer analysis
programs for Dao/Neutreeko and see if Teeko is within reach.
Do you have a complete list of the tournament game rules?
