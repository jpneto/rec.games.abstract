| Yep, you definitely missed some very important simplifying assumptions.

| Obviously, by the count of how many positions you considered, you were

| of "chunks" of consecutively-numbered cards.  When the tableau is
| initially dealt out there may be up to five chunks per stack (or seven
| chunks per stack if you are playing the 8-stack variation) and two more
| pseudo-chunks in the hold spots.  However, since there is no provision

| will never increase over the course of the game.  This is effectively
| the same reasoning by which it is shown that it never hurts to put cards
| on their aces whenever possible.
| 
| From now on, the program should only consider "moves" which cause an
| entire chunk to be put into a new position.  This reduces your overly
| humongous move tree down to only the interesting branch nodes.  The
| three types of moves remaining are: (a) movement of a chunk onto the
| next higher consecutive chunk on the tableau (provided at least
| chunksize-1 spots are open in the hold area), (b) movement of a chunk
| headed by a King onto an empty stack (provided at least chunksize-1
| spots are open in the hold area), and (c) movement of an entire chunk
| into the hold spots (provided there are at least chunksize open spots
| AND that it is not possible to move this chunk directly to the next
| higher chunk).
| 
| Before and/or after each of these moves, the program should also
| simplify the position as much as possible by moving cards to aces (of
| course), and by moving cards down from the hold spots into the tableau.
| These simplifications should <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be considered moves in the move

Interesting that this discussion should arise now; I saw the above posts
late last night after having spent the day "lifting the hood" on the
solution algorithm in the version of the game I've got.

Jon's comments are right on the money: moving only chunks will save a lot
of searching.  But even if you're moving single cards -- which is what the
program I was looking at does -- the search tree should be a lot smaller
than several million.  I conjecture that perhaps Fred's friend's program
did not keep a record of positions already examined, and thus potentially
re-examined positions reached by multiple routes, or reached multiple times
due to cyclic moves.

One other modification that can save a lot of searching -- and which made
the program I was looking at come down to a fairly small search space even
using single moves -- is to recognise when a position has become impossible
due to "buried" cards.  When the sequence at the bottom of a stack is about
to exceed 5 cards, check whether there are any lower numbered cards of the
same suit deeper in the stack.  If so, that's a lost position.

Regarding Jon's algorithm (which I intend to code up when I have some time),
I note that there's a small flaw that needs to be patched:  Moving cards
down from the hold area is automatic ONLY for non-Kings.  Moving a King down
might get in the way of moving a King from the tableau into the empty
column, or moving a different King out of the hold area.  This means there
is a 4th type of move: moving a King from the hold area to an empty space.
(When such a move is made, it may of course result in other cards moving
down from the hold area onto the King; these are automatic as usual.)

Although the search is probably fast enough without this, another speedup
you can try is to recognise some more "automatic" moves.  E.g., once a
column consists of a single sequence headed by a King, moving more cards
onto that column can't hurt.  Likewise, if a column ends with a sequence of
6 or more cards, adding more to that sequence can't hurt.

Speaking of automatic moves, it should be noted that the 8-column variant
builds with alternating color in the tableau, which means it is NOT automatic
to move cards to the foundation piles.  I.e., if you put the 5 of spades onto
the 4, you may be screwing up your ability to move a red 4.

Oh, one other thing that helps reduce the search, assuming you're keeping
track of positions already reached, is to enforce a canonical form on the
positions.  In particular, sort the cards in the hold area, and sort any
tableau columns that are single king-headed sequences or empty.  I.e.,
swapping two king-headed sequences or moving a king from one tableau column
to another, doesn't produce a different position.

If I get my program written, I'll post it to comp.sources.games and report
it here.
