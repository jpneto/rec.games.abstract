There seems to be a few Abalone players reading this group, so I'll take my 
chance here.

I'm in the process of writing a game of Abalone for a programming contest.
The big problem is that nobody here really knows how to play.  I would
be very thankful to anybody who could bring little pieces of strategy
information about the game.

The only thing I have pickup by playing a couple games is: keep your stones
together, and stay away from the edge!  I'm sure there's a lot more to it.

Information about this contest should be posted to this group anytime by
the person organizing it.  If it isn't, and you're interested in entering,
try to e-mail <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:eadengler@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca">eadengler@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca</a> for details.

	Thanks for your help,
	David Ebbo
