Same thing I've said about many other games with "problems".

I think it's always just a matter of taste, but to me Chess is far
from perfect.  The biggest problem I have with Chess is the opponent
factor; it is so difficult to find a player who is better than you are
while remaining challenged by your play.  For me the game is only
interesting when it isn't an open and shut case from the opener.

You can probably tell I don't often play.

I'll bite.

All of the major online servers solve this problem simply with ratings. 
Play only people within, say, 150 points of you and the games should fit 
that description.

Similarly, in tournaments, the setup usually results in most players 
playing most of their games against players of aproximately their own 
ability.
