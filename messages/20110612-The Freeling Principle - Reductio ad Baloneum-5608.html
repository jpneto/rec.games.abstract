Christian Freeling has created a magical game playing mechanism whereby
games that have it "converge to 50/50 in the long run".

Freeling explains:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

To restate the obvious: it means that the move protocol and its
balancing mechanism will in a hypothetical world with a large
player base have these games naturally and inevitably converge
to a 50/50 win/lose overall score at the highest level of play.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The two magical games which feature the Freeling mechanism are Sygo and
Symple.  They can be played on any size board (or any odd size board in the
case of Symple).

Freeling explains:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The game is played on an odd sized square board, whereby
different sizes are possible.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This would seem to include tiny boards, starting with 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, etc.

One can easily deduce that Symple and Sygo, just like all other games in the
universe, fall apart at the seams when the board size is reduced enough. 
They're either automatic wins for player 1, automatic wins for player 2, or
completely swamped with advantage for one player or the other.

The notion that 3x3 Sygo would "converge to 50/50 in the long run" is
obviously BALONEY!

If the magical Freeling principle doesn't work with tiny boards, then there
must be some integer N for which a base N board "converges to 50/50", while
a base N-1 board does not.  More BALONEY!!

I presented this argument months ago here in rec.games.abstract.  Christian
Freeling at that point essentially fled the group.  Later when he started
shovelling the same magical horse shit in the Arimaa forum, I presented the
same argument there.  This time, Freeling responded with a one line,
typically inane comment, and otherwise didn't address the argument at all,
which I took as a concession of defeat.  Fine.  Game over.  But then, a
couple days later, Freeling starts the magical shit shovelling again, as
though oblivious to the obvious fallacy!!!!
