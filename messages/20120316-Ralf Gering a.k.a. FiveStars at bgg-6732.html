Geekmail from Mistress Octavia, moderator of bgg:
################################
Hi Mark,

I do not know what the nature of your feud with user FiveStars is, and I do
not care to know. All we care about is that you don't use our site to
continue it.

This is your warning that if you use BGG to harass user FiveStars in any
way, including but not limited to sending him geekmail and creating fake
accounts to rate his games, our only response will be to indefinitely
suspend your account.

Likewise, if FiveStars uses BGG in any way to harass you please let me know
immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

-MMM

Go ahead and suspend my account, Mistress Octavia.  I don't really a fuck. 
Bgg is the intellectual 99%.  Nitwit central.  I used bgg when I found it
expedient, but now it's of little use to me.

If I'm going to be accused of "harassing" Hermann Goering every time someone
gives his game a low rating, I'll cancel the account myself.  I don't have
time for this shit.

You want to know what put a burr in Hermann's boy brief panties?  Just
google "Ralf Gering" and select the first search result.  Hermann
(Mr_Mancala), in classic Nazi fashion, has created locked wiki "critiques"
of me and countless other people (not to mention bgg).  In response, I
created a critique of Hermann which has now become his lasting legacy. 
Hermann can't handle the truth.

Live by propaganda, die by propaganda, Hermann.  You should have learned
that lesson from your famous grandfather.
