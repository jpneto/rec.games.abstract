Apparently no theorems are known about the computational complexity of

As a variation, we could also specify a bound on the number of moves.
It is not even immediately clear that this problem is in NP, because the
obvious "certificate" (i.e., the list of moves) could be exponential in
length.

The question is definitely in P; in fact, finite.  One could
list all the K positions in chess (on a sufficiently large 
computer).  Now take the KxK matrix, and start out by writing
0 in all the diagonal positions, 1 in the ij position if it
is possible to get from position i to position j in one move,
and K+1 otherwise.  Now proceed to produce a new array by
replacing the ij-th element by the minimum of the sum over
m of the im-th and the mj-th elements.  It is trivial to see
that this terminates (reduces no elements) in at less than
K^2 steps; the number is even less than K.  The element in
the ij-th position on termination is the number of moves
needed to get from position i to position j.
