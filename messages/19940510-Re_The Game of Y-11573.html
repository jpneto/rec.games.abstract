This is a follow-up to the posts regarding the Game of Y, which was reviewed in
the June, '94 issue of Games. I don't have the artistic ability to depict the
game board, but the Games article, and the 1993-94 catalog from Kadon
Enterprises (the manufacturer), depict the board. 

Briefly, the board is basically triangular, with bowed-out sides. Players
alternate placing a stone of their color on one of the 93 intersections on the
board, and the winner is the first to link all three edges of the board with an
unbroken line of stones of his or her color. The three corner intersections
belong to both sides that meet at a corner. Once placed, the stones are not
moved, jumped, or captured.

I've only had the game for a few days, so I can't yet agree with the Games
reviewer, who called it a game you'll never tire of playing. I've found it
strategically interesting, and the hardwood board, glass Go stones, and
cuordoroy carrying pouches [for both the board and the stones] are a nice
touch.

You can order the game for $39.00 plus $3.90 S &amp; H from Kadon at the following
address:

Kadon Enterprises, Inc.
1227 Lorene Dr., Suite 16

Enjoy,
