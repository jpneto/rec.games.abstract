<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting Patrick's message of Tuesday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I've been into chess off and on all my life, and right now I'm on an up
<br>cycle.&nbsp; Lately I've also gotten interested in checkers (draughts),
<br>another recurrent interest.&nbsp; But I have a thing about doing things in
<br>threes--so I'm wondering what other game would naturally complete this
<br>set.&nbsp; If I were going to focus on just three abstract (perfect
<br>information, randomizer-free) board games, which game would go best
<br>with chess and checkers?
<br></blockquote>
<br>My first thought was to relax the randomiser-free criteria and go for 
backgammon, as there is so much gaming equipment to allow you to carry 
all three around in one box.&nbsp; But if you want to be strict on that, then 
your later suggestion of nine men's morris is the obvious choice.&nbsp; It's 
historical too.&nbsp; In the past, these compendium boxes would be square, 
rather than rectangular, with chess/draughts on one outside surface, 
nine men's morris on the other and backgammon inside.
<br>
<br>I'd still consider tablut/hnefatafl as an alternative, though you'd have 
to be careful which variant you choose, as some work better than others. 
One of the Icelandic sagas - I can't remember which at the moment - 
mentions a gaming board which was for chess and hnefatafl, so they were 
associated.
