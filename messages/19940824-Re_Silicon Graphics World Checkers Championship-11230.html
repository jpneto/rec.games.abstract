maybe not yet, but i wouldn't bet on it not happening soon.  the best
chess programs are master-rank now.

The POINT is, the chess world championship is for HUMANS ONLY. It doesn't 
matter how good the computers get, they will not be included.

Why? who told you so?

Please note that it has been proven over and over again that just
having a faster computer is not enough to win at chess. It might be so
in the future, but as of now speed is not alone enough.  This is why
you can't just compare chess with  100 meeters run in olympics (as a
previous poster compared.)

Because of this reason, IMHO, it is ok to  allow computers in the world
championship.

My only complain is that a computer can remember 1000s of opening moves
and I can't.
