Your only example in your .PDF file is like the one Ed gave above,
and it is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>so<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> trivial to disrupt this case that I wonder if you have seriously tried the

I was trying to demonstrate two things in my PDF file.  First of all,
I'm answering the question, "Is it possible for Player 1 to win simply
by filling in all of Player 2's edge points?"  I think we can all
agree that the abundantly obvious answer to that is no.

The second thing I was trying to demonstrate is that the obvious
counter-strategy to the edge-fill strategy is only slightly more
sophisticated than the edge-fill strategy.  I think it's safe to
assume that a strategy to foil the strategy that foils the edge-fill
strategy would be more complex yet.  Simply because the counter-
counter-counters start piling up, it starts to get a little
complicated.  More of a guess than a fact though.  There could be a
kink in my theory, but only time will tell.

We could settle by trying say 10 games of 9x9 against each other, and if my
edge strategy wins each one with little thought that would show something?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The only thing that would demonstrate is that I'm a lousy game
player.  I'll concede that up front.  Now on a 9x9 there's probably
going to be a first move advantage, even among beginners.  I've only
played one complete game: a 9x9 against myself.  But I've started a
couple of 19x19 games on superdupergames.org, one of which I'm quickly
losing, as anticipated.

(I'm not convinced my strategy will win, as I've not played much, but I'm
not sure how much you've actually played either!  And if it turns out that
the game is indeed more complicated than I first thought, I'll be delighted.
:-)

Let's keep our fingers crossed.  I only develop games that seem
architecturally interesting to me.  It rarely happens that they
develop flaws.  Somewhat more commonly, though still infrequently,
they turn out to be not fun to play.  I don't really have any control
over that.  If they work, and they seem pretty cool, I release them.

I look forward to playing you Mike, although I'm sure you're going to
kill me.  I keep a running challenge open as (you guessed it)
MarkSteere.
