Listen Topzag, you're obviously new here but anyone who says Go and
Chess are the best abstract games shouldn't be posting in RGA. Go, I
can handle, its got a decent level of depth and a simple rule set. But
Chess? Chess is a fucking joke!!!!!! The fact that people still even
play Chess and call it "the thinking man's game" is a perfect
demonstration of people's ignorance of abstract games. At least every
year we get new movies, music, books, even though the most popular
examples of those are more often than not (especially when it comes to
music) arguably less technically adequate than others.  But Chess is a
stubborn bastard, even though the science of abstract game design has
developed far greater games, a game from the dark ages still has the
nerve to purport itself to be "the thinking man's game." when its
hardly even relevant to the abstract game elite. Just as the top music
charts are inundated with singles from useless no-talents like Lady
Gaga, Katy Perry, Usher, Justin Bieber, or whoever the fuck else I do
not think the popularity of games like Chess and Go in any way
supports their inherent superiority over little known print and play
games produced by Mark Steere or Luis Bolanos Mures or Nick Bentley or
myself. In fact I think this statement holds especially true in the
case of abstract games which  I believe can be qualified more or less
objectively based on criteria like balance, draw rate, depth. As I've
said elsewhere even clarity can be measured objectively based on the
volatility of how the advantage shifts or how many moves seem viable
on any given turn. And I don't want to hear about how the most
competitive games aren't necessarily the best ones. Also Tic Tac Toe
is by far the most popular abstract game in existence, that hardly
makes it a good game. And finally I'll say not all popular abstracts
are bad, Amazons is brilliant, as is Dots and Boxes but the popularity
of those games doesn't make them good or bad, their level of balance,
depth and clarity of play are what make them good abstracts.
