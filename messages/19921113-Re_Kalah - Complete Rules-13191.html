It is my understandind that play ends if a player has no stones and it is
his/her turn. If on my last move my last stone does not land in my scoring
pit or kalah (I believe this is called a "halak"), leaving me with no
stones, the game is not over. If the other player does not transfer any
stones to my side however, I can no longer make a move, THEN play ends.

Another way I was told that the game could end, though this could be wrong,
is if one player gets more than half the stones in his scoring pit. At this
point the winner is already known, but maybe play continues in order to see
how close a score can be achieved. Please correct me if this is incorrect.

At this point, the player with stones
remaining takes all of the stones from his pits and places them in his
scoring pit. The winner is the player with the most stones in his score
pit.

As someone noted earlier, there is a computer program available for IBM
PCs, KALAKH.ZIP, which is available at most IBM game archives. (Last
place I saw it was in the games directory of wuarchive's umich mirror.)

I do have one other rule question. If the last stone I place lands in an
empty pit on my side (a capture normally) and there are no stones in the
opposite pit, does my stone go into my scoring pit?


Just my $0.02.
