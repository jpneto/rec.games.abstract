I've played about 10 games with my wife, and we'd like some strategy
tips/opinions to see if we're on the same page as other gamers.

Do you...

1.  ...play white stones first?  In our first games, we played the dark
stones first thinking played stones would be the most vulnerable.  
However, in our games, it turns out that the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>unplayed<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> stones are the
most vulnerable, and that it's much easier to protect stones that are on
the board.  So now the white stones come out first (for the most part).

2.  ...have many "isolation" captures?  After the first couple games, we
have gotten so into the sacrifice aspect of the game, that the board
doesn't shrink enough for these sorts of captures to occur with any
frequency.  Perhaps going to the "tournament" rules would change this (we
haven't tried it yet).

3.  ...find that the first player loses most often?  I'm sure this will
change with experience, but the first turn player loses about 80% of our
games!

Any other tips/observations?

We're having fun figuring out strategy for this baby, but I'd like to hear
some second opinions.

Added bonus:  this is the only abstract strategy game my wife will play
with me.
