problem, because it is fair.  Caylus is a different animal completely
here as far as games go.  I think the nature of games part of IAGO
should involve the placing of pieces on a board that have a positional
impact on the game.  With Through the Desert that is so.  With Caylus,
it is not.  This needs to be a criterion.

I am not saying include Caylus because obviously it is themed too much.
However I don't see why abstract games should necessarily involve
placing pieces on a board with positional impact on the game.
Admittedly I can't think of many abstract games that do something
different - but I don't feel the need to close that avenue off prematurely.
Also I don't even see the need for a board (as suc) - would anyone argue 
against Axiom being an abstract?  Although everything you do in Axiom
is for positional advantage the playing surface (the cubes) are moved
and even eliminated during play.
