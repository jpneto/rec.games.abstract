What are the measurements of an 
official othello board and discs?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't know if this helps but I have two Othello sets...

The first one is "Tournament Othello" produced by Gabriel in 1977. 
The full board is approximate 14.5 inches by 18 inches.  (The playing
field is approximatel7 13 inches by 13 inches.)  The discs are
slightly smaller in size to an American silver dollar.

My second set is a 1990 set by Pressman.  The dimensions of this board
are approximately 14 inches by 11 inches.  (The playing field is
approximately 10 inches by 10 inches.)  The discs are almost identical
in size to that of an American quarter.



I assume by "official" you're referring to the size of the sets used
in offical Othello tournaments.  (I know Othello was big in the
'70s...  Can one still find and enter Othello tournaments?  I haven't
heard of any such tournaments here in the US in a long time.)

Since I think very little "Tournament Size" Othello sets were
produced, I'm willing to bet most everyone who brings a set to an
Othello tourney brings the standard, smaller size.
