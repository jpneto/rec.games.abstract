I've been thinking about how to write an AI program to play Arimaa, and all
I could think of was writing it like a go program, so I was interested to
see David's remarks. That doesn't help me much though, because I don't know
how to write a go program. I assume most go programs look for patterns, and
then generate candidate moves and evaluations based on the patterns, but I
have no idea how to do that.

I have yet to actually finish a game, but the move system makes it into
a game of small increments. I find myself able to radically prune my
lookahead because of this fact, as well.

I didn't think most go programs used look ahead, though I can imagine how an
Arimaa program might.

Given a particular situation
in an area, it is fairy easy to determine the subset of pieces that
can influence the position over the next turn or two because you know
that there are no pieces with global influence. The fact that you can
split your move among several pieces means that direct attacks are
fairly easy to foil, you have to play for a strategic position that
narrows your opponents options.

Interesting. Could you give a little more detail on both of those points,
David? By the way, are you thinking of trying for the $10,000 prize?
