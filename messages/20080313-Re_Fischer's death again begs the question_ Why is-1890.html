Getting back to the original question for a moment, could it also have
something to do with the fact that chess provides no natural opportunity

A friend was telling me that the original TV coverage of chess was
very invasive-- big cameras staring over a little board. In addition,
color would have made the playing area very hot and uncomfortable, due
to the increased lighting needs. In any case, once Fischer stopped
cooperating, TV said, "Who cares?"

One of these days, I'm gonna try to recreate a Kasparov-Deep Blue game
for YouTube. Does anybody know good sources about the incidentals? I
know the game I want already, I just need to know how Kasparov was
doing on time, some of the behind-the-scenes.
