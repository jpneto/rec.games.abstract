What's with the flurry of "solutions" lately?  We've already got a plan
worked out for the current contest.  Daniel is creating physical versions of
the games to play in real life, and the judges are going to rate them.  In
fact the judging period has already started.  Why don't we see how the
current contest works out before scrambling to rework the format for future
contests?

Agreed, but there is this guy here named Mark Steere who is already
throwing up disclaimers right &amp; left about the current process.

Agreed, let's see how this works out.


But later, it seems an easy solution to your primary concern is to
have anonymous submissions.  The rest of my proposal can be tossed,
well enough.  But anonymous submission would eliminate a lot of the
prejudice you correctly bring up (perhaps by having stand-in people
here to play the scenario out).
