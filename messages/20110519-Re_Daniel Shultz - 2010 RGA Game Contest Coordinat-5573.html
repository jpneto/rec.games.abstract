Three games have made it to the final voting phase.
In alphabetical order the games are:

Kasanari Shogi
Mixtour
Splay

Congrats to the finalists!
1st, 2nd and 3rd will be announced as soon as possible.

I'm mid chaos at the moment with finalizing family vacation plans in
Ireland for Monday, running a juggling convention which starts
tomorrow here in Berlin, Hosting people at my house, new
girlfriend ;), etc... so be a bit patient if this is a day late.

There are a few questions about the final voting process that I'm
waiting on Prof. Dee for so that it's done as fair as possible.  It's
no use announcing botched results.  The first wave made it clear who
was in the final so I'm very happy with that.

So yeah... almost over!

Daniel
