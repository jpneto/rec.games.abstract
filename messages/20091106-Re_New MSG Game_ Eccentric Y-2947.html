I knew these stats would flush out the trembling little Vintershitz.
A committed group of igGameCenter members is advancing Oust strategy
into uncharted territory, day by day.  It's not an endless procession
of one time players, Vintershitz.  But I suppose I'm "convincing"
everyone to play Oust again and again, hundreds of times, right
Vintershitz?

Why can't you just admit that Oust is an extremely well thought of
game that's exploding in popularity, Vintershitz, you yapping, heel
nipping little doggy?  YAP!! YAP!! YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP-YAP!!
Is it really that difficult for you to accept?
