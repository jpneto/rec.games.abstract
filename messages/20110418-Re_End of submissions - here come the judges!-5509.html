Cristian, in all seriousness, it's an honor to have my games on
MindSports.  

If you look back you'll see that all of my unflattering comments about
your games have been defensive reactions to your outlandish claims
about said games. As in "Oh come on. You gotta be kidding me."

You're still mad because I logically demonstrated that Symple is not a
perfect game as you claimed. 

I'm not initiating topics like "Hey does everyone appreciate how
crappy Christian's latest game is?"

It's said that all babies are cute and cuddly but they aren't always.
Imagine a mom demanding that people acknowledge how beautiful her ugly
baby is. 

Stop perpetrating hoaxes as a means of self glorification. Everyone
has to bear the weight of that burden. 

Btw, I believe that Symple has a sophisticated balancing mechanism.
But that fact alone does not rocket Symple to dizzying heights for me.
