3-D go may be unplayable, but what about go on an arbitrary graph: It's
a superset of normal go, but some vertices would have a higher "value"
than others because they are adjacent to more other vertices. Any
research on this?

I have (briefly) looked into using Penrose tiles for Go.

In case you haven't heard of these, they consist (in this version) of
two different rhombic tiles, both with all sides being length 1, but
with different angles (36 and 144 versus 72 and 108). With these tiles
you can tile the infinite plane, but (with some purely local
restrictions on placement) it can only be done non-periodically.

The game consists of two phases: first you construct the board, then
you play. Constructing the board consists of alternately placing tiles
on the table, in such a way that a new tile must touch as many of the
already laid tiles as possible. This continues until a certain number
of tiles have been placed. Then the game is played using the normal Go
rules, with the only exception being that you play on the tiles
instead of the vertices.

Due to the shape of the tiles, every tile has four freedoms (like in
normal Go), but the number of tiles that meet at a vertex can vary
from 3 to 10. As the board grows, the ratio of the tiles approach the
golden mean (1.618...), so one could count the tiles differently in
the final score. In any case, the number of available tiles should be
in this ratio, preferably by choosing two consecutive fibonacci
numbers (e.g. 55 and 89, giving a total of 144 tiles). The board
should be somewhat smaller than a normal Go board, as the complexity
is higher. Also, the tiles have to be larger than the gridsize of a
normal Go board, as they are hard to handle otherwise.
