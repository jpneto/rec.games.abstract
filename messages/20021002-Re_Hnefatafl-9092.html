I wish I did. Part of the problem is that there is no agreement on what
the rules were. There is more of a consensus on hnefatafl than on, say,
ludus latrunculorum. There is actually quite a bit of similarity among
many proposed reconstructions of the rules, especially more recent ones,
and many of the rules sets do make the game enjoyable. But even rather
minor differences in the rules can make a big difference in stategy and
tactics. Since there is not a large enough group of people playing the
game according to the same rules, we do not have a body of experts
gradually building up practical knowledge of the game which could be
passed on to other talented people, and to a lesser extent to ordinary
mortals. A pity, because it looks like hnefatafl could be quite a good
game if we had some good strategic principles.

The (almost certain) reasons for the confusion over rules are:

1. We know of no set of written down rules - the nearest we have from the
17th century give part of the rules written by someone who may have
observed, but did not play the game [&amp; more likely his informant had half
remembered rules he'd seen his grandfather play by ...]

2. There wasn't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>a<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> set of rules. Standard rules is a very modern concept.
Before the late 19th century ruules for any game would be very local and
would vary over time. We know that table boards varied in size though they
have identifying features that help us set up the basic rules.

In producing a modern version of this, and other historical games I have
used these guidlines:

1. Go back to the originals - ie to begin with, at least ignore other
modern equivalents;

2. Use as many different examples as possible of original boards / rules.

3. Itemise and include all the features that all originals have and try to
make sense of those that are different.

4. Try variations of boards and rules and see what makes a good game. Try
to identify what it is that makes the good game.

5. Produce a game that surfaces from 4. Make variations on it and test.

6. Choose a variation that fits the originals (ie if you dropped it back as
one of the originals in 1 it wouldn't look out of place) <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> also appeals
to modern players.

7. Make modifications to 'balance' and 'fine-tune' the game and re-check as
per 6.

8. Do a final play-test.

Others would take the most complete set of rules and simply try to fill the
blanks. I think that's a mistake.

BTW - with the tables game 'the balance' was the hardest but, IMHO, the
most critical part. The task was to make the game equally likely to result
in a win for either side; the problem was that if you balanced it for
beginners it wouldn't be balanced for advanced players. My compromise is a
game that I'm fairly certain won't be identical to any played in the past -
but it does fit the design criteria above.

In short: you won't get a set of rules for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> game. There is no such
thing as <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> game. But:
it should be possible to produce a set of algorithms that would apply to
most variations and there are fairly standard pieces of advice that apply
to most/all variations eg your movements can be hampered by your own pieces
so there are circumstances where it may be in your interests to allow your
pieces to be captured.
