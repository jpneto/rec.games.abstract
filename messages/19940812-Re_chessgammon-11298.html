In the recently posted rules to chessgammon, it is stated that the rules 
for castling and en passant capture apply "in the obvious way."  Castling
has subsequently been explained.  Darse, please tell us how en passant
capture works.  

Must a 1 be rolled and used on the first roll after a pawn is double-advanced,
or can the agressive pawn be captured at the first subsequent opportunity?
With a white pawn on e4, black pawn on d6, if black rolls 1-1 and plays d6-d4,
and white rolls a 1, can he capture en passant?  And with a white pawn on e4,
black pawns on d5, c7, if black rolls a 1 and plays c7-c5, and then white rolls
1-1, can white play d4-d5-c6 capturing en passant?

Much as I love the en passant rule, I submit that it serves no particular
purpose in chessgammon.  Nevertheless, I do love it.  I suggest that the rule
by the following:  A pawn which moves more than one square on its turn, either
by double-advancing from the second to the fourth rank, or by moving twice on
a throw of 1-1, may, if the next throw of the dice is appropriate, be 
immediately captured by an opposing pawn which attacks any of the squares 
through which the first, fast-travelling pawn has moved.  Interestingly, this
rule would allow long strings of consecutive en-passant captures in certain
circumstances.

I look forward to trying out this interesting game soon.
