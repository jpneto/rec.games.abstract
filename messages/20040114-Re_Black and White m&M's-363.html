2.  The object is to get 4-in-a-row orthogonally (not diagonally).

I found no obvious way for either Black or White to force a win.  That
being said, I think it's likely that repeated play would reveal a need
to add a further balancing restriction or two.

Blocking every  4-in-a-row could be achieved with a pattern that covers only
1/4 of the infinite plane.  While the orthogonally-connected rule limits the
ability of a player to achieve this pattern, the fact that a player has
twice as many moves to black as are theoretically necessary makes it very
likely that a player can block.  Hence you (probably) won't have any way for
a player to force a win.

The average game lasted about thirty moves.  I don't know how many packs of
black and white M&amp;M's that would necessitate.

What caused the game to end?  Tactical error in blocking?

If I'm right about no forced win, and there are no draws, perfect play would
end up in an everlasting game.

Interesting game though.  I've got something slightly similar on my web site
but won't try promoting it again here.
