Goodbye, Mark and Christian.  It's been interesting, but can't stick
around with Corey Clark attacking me at every turn.  I don't
understand it, and don't have to subject myself to it.  Maybe we will
meet up somewhere else on the net.  And Christian, I can't really
understand why you think a Corey Clark moderated group is something
you want to participate in, but wish you the best anyway.

I can't help noticing that you don't want to participate in a
moderated group yet you leave one that is not moderated. The only
control I have is over what I post, not what others post. I have a
deep faith in an even deeper truth:

"Shit happens".

I prefer to get it up front though, and this place at least lives up
to that. I've been at places where you get stabbed in the back. Not to
imply Corey's group, by the way, and I have nothing against
moderation, but everything against sanctimony.
