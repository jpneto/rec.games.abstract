One of the two diagrams I had deleted was deemed more useful than not (by
Luis), so I put half of it back in (Figure 5) sans explicit reference to
"eyes".

This time a slight rewording of the preceding text was required.

Old wording:
"CAPTURES  A capturing placement results in one or more groups, of either or
both colors, having no liberties.  Such a placement must, and can only be,
made with a red stone.  Said red stone is permanent.  It cannot itself be
captured.  In Figure 2, Black captures a white group with a red stone.  Self
capture is allowed."

New wording:
"CAPTURES  A capturing placement results in one or more groups, of either or
both colors, having no liberties.  Such a placement can only be made with a
red stone.  Conversely, a red stone can only be placed if it bounds one or
more groups of either or both colors.  Red stones are permanent.  They
cannot themselves be captured.  In Figure 2, Black captures a white group
with a red stone.  Self capture is allowed."
