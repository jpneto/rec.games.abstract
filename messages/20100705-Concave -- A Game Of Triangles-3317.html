Here is a game for any plural number of players.

Needed: Blank piece of paper and a pen/pencil.

In the first part of the game, players take turns placing n dots on
the paper. No 3 dots are to be co-linear. n is determined ahead of
time amongst the players and is a multiple of the number of players.

The first player to move connects any (almost any) 3 dots with 3
straight line segments to make a triangle, such that no dots are on
the interior of the triangle.

Thereafter, the players continue to take turns. On a turn, a player
makes a triangle either by connecting (with two straight line
segments) a single dot to two dots that are at the ends of the side of
a triangle already drawn, or by drawing a single line connecting two
dots that are two vertices of two adjacent triangles that come
together to form a concave angle (a concave angle along the perimeter
of the polygon containing all the triangles drawn so far).

No line-segments shall coincide with line-segments already drawn.

The triangles drawn in this game shall contain no dots in their
interiors.

After a player moves, she gets a point for each concave angle along
the perimeter of the bounding polygon, the polygon containing all the
triangles drawn so far.

The player gets an addition point every move he completes a triangle
with only one line-segment.

(Note: A player only makes one triangle per move.)

The game ends when the convex hull of the dots is completed.

The player with the most points wins.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
