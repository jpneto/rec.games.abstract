If you want to plagiarize my idea of one player acting vertical and the other horizontal start by hexgame in square grid.
Player A place 2 stones in one the rows but the 2 have to be separated at least by one square 
Player B too place 2 stones in one of the columns with the 2 stones separated.
There is North South or East West zones.
The first one to connect any sides (NS or EW) win the game.
That is the idea and there is a need to add maybe one rule to make the fluid.
I did not simulate it but I had the idea yesterday.
You can apply my idea to a variant of chess at least for the rooks and the knights with a little adaptation (move as usual but capture only horizontally or vertically either for one one the rooks or knights either for player A vertical player B horizontal).
and so on.
There are 1000 games to be converted to such theme (Vertical Horizontal) so 1000 variants.
