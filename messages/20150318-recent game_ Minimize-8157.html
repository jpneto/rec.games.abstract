Minimize is a game that seems to yield some fierce tactics while still being extremely simple. You could even play with Xs and Os.

You almost always want to play your opponent's color, trying to build small "territories" that you can create tiny groups in. Beginners should definitely start out on the base 5 grid and slowly work their way up to larger boards.

The game has definitely been most popular with two moves per turn, and the easiest way for beginners to handle the pie-rule is by playing only a single piece on the very first turn. It should also be mentioned that it seems to work on square grids as well, and some people even prefer it that way.

The rules are explained here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/255619061/Minimize">https://www.scribd.com/doc/255619061/Minimize</a>
