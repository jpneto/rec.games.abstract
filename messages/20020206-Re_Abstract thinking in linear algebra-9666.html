The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,
understanding cannot be taught in calculus.  Children are able
to understand mathematical concepts until this ability is
destroyed by imitating computers.

Could you explain this last sentence, please? It sure seems to be the case
that learning mathematics is easier for young children than for older
children,
but what does 'imitating computers' have to do with that?

In my experience, some people who are bad at math are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>helped<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by learning
how to program a computer. When they write programs that do purely formal
string manipulations, they come across bugs, and have to fix them, etc.
Thus, they definitely learn something about formal definitions. Especially
about the difference wteen their own (vague) intuitions and formal
definitions. To a large extent, they even become 'mathematical minds', after
a while.

I have the impression that you meant something entirely different?

Cheers,
