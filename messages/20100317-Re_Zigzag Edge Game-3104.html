A game for two players:

Start with a grid of (n-1)-by-(n-1) squares, or n-by-n lines. I
suggest that n be at least 12.

The players take turns placing dots on the grid, one dot each move at
any intersection of the grid that does not yet have a dot on either of
the two intersecting (horizontal and vertical) grid-lines.

After n dots are placed -- and the dots represent a permutation of
(1,2,3,...n) -- the strategy portion of the game is over.

Either of the players then draws (n-1) straight line-segments (called
"permutation lines"), starting at the leftmost dot, a line-segment
drawn between each dot and the dot on the vertical grid-line
immediately to the right. (So, you get a zigzag, in lots of cases.)

Then, either player draws (n-1) straight line-segments (also called
permutation lines), starting at the topmost dot, a line-segment drawn
between each dot and the dot on the horizontal grid-line immediately
below.

Now, the two intersecting zigzags are inclosed within a polygon (not
talking about the convex hull), the perimeter of which is made up of
permutation lines and/or parts of permutation lines.
Call each straight line-segment along this perimeter an "edge line".
Two permutation lines that meet at one vertex AND have the same slope
are considered to both be part of one edge-line. Two edge lines may
come together somewhere other than at a dot (in which case an edge
line takes up only part of a permutation line).

Player 1 gets as a score the number of edge lines from the leftmost
dot to the rightmost dot along the TOP of the bounding polygon's
perimeter.

Player 2 gets as a score the number of edge lines from the leftmost
dot to the rightmost dot along the BOTTOM of the bounding polygon's
perimeter.

Largest score wins.

Note: The bounding polygon may narrow to a single point. Four edge-
lines are considered to meet at such a point, even though only two
permutation lines cross there.


Example game:
Let us say we have a grid of 9-by-9 lines.
Label the grid's vertical lines 1 to 9, starting at the bottom. And
label the grid's horizontal lines 1 through 9, starting on the left.
During play, the dots are drawn at these grid-line intersections:
(1,6), (2,7), (3,8), (4,4), (5,5), (6,9), (7,1), (8,3), (9,2).

Player 1 gets 5 points. Player 2 gets 5 points. A tie.

Note that the permutation-line segments connecting (1,6) to (2,7) to
(3,8) count as one edge line. Also note that the permutation line
(6,9) to (7,1) and the permutation line (4,4) to (8,3) intersect
within a grid-square, and that we have 4 edge-lines (2 edge lines to
player 1's score, 2 edge lines to player 2's score) meeting at this
intersection.


What is a strategy for this game if you are player 1, or if you are
player 2?

My thoughts:

As player 1 you would want to maximize the number of slope changes,
while keeping the lines as high as possible. This would mean starting
low, and (moving left to right) try to do:

1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 6, 9, 3

Wherein I started as low as possible and climbed by 1,2 alternately,
dropping as little as possible when I needed to drop.

As player 2, you would want to do the same, except rotated 90 degrees.
