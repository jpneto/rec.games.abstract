For zero sum games with 3 or more players, one may also need a further
restriction, namely one prohibiting coalition formation. Consider, for
example, the usual attitude towards cooperation amongst players in
poker, or the like.

Anatol Rapoport, in chapter 18 of his <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>N-person Game Theory<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>,
describes a four person zero sum game called ``So Long Sucker'' in
which coalitions are allowed. [The game was invented by Hausner, Nash,
Shapley and Shubik.] After describing some of the double-crosses that
are possible in the game, Rapoport remarks:

   ``We gather what Martin Shubik meant when, in describing the
     game, he wrote `The four inventors of the game still occasionally
     talk to each other'.''

I will post rules if there is any interest...
