Generally, though not always (Nim being a notable exception), the
larger a game tree is, the more resistant it is to first move
advantage.  In order to be perfectly free, in a theoretical sense, of
first (or second) move advantage, the game would have to be infinitely
long, and therefore not a game.  Realistically, to thwart first move
advantage in a practical sense, the game would have to be really,
really long.  First move advantage doesn't normally kick in until
players start becoming rather expert.  (Hex is an exception.  Beginners
can feel the first move advantage right away.)  Ideally a game should
be scalable, so beginners to have to suffer an extraordinarily lengthy
game, and experts can increase the size to accommodate their growing
skill.

As far as breaking up the game into multi-move turns, I don't like that
idea.  You're effectively increasing the granularity, or decreasing the
total number of moves, making it even more vulnerable to first move
advantage - the very thing you're trying to avoid.

  it is difficult to back up the assertion, either way, for
  a sufficiently complex abstract game.  you need an enormous
  sample size.


  i am curious why there arent simply games with one move for the
  first player and then 2 moves back and forth the rest of the way.


  progressive chess goes 1 move, 2 moves, 3 moves, 4, 5, 6, 7...
  has there been any research on 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...?  it isnt
  clear to me was the progressive chess tempo advantage is.  if
  just count the cumulative moves, it goes 1-0, 1-2, 4-2, 4-6,
  9-6, 9-12, 16-12, 16-20....but defending for an 8-move turn
  must be a nightmare.  with 1,2,2,2,2...the analysis paralysis
  problem may be held under control.  however, this fairy chess
  version may have already been shown to lead to an unsatisfactory
  game in the past.


  my approach to this problem was different.  i split up the move
  into 2 parts, with each player having control over one of the 2
  parts.  it's sort of like baseball beginning with the ball in
  the pitching hand of the defense.


  certainly there must have been a fairy chess game where your
  opponent gets to pick which moveable piece you must use.  i
  would suspect that would need a lot of fixups to actually work,
  without thinking to hard about it.


  however, to return to Hex and its variations, this "pitching"
  approach cant apply unless the board is multicolored and you
  are given a color you have to play your move on.  Hex naturally
  leads to 3 colors, but you could have any number.  despite
  seemingly having control, the defense will eventually have to
  pick a losing color.
