&lt;&lt; I've invented the game of "TouchDown" and would like your opinion on
playing stragey, etc.

Rules:

The game is played on a board with 4 rows and 8 coloumns like this (view
using a fixed-width font):

OOOOOOOO
.........
.........
XXXXXXXX

The pieces move like pawns in chess, i.e. move forward one square at a time,
but capture diagonally.

The winner is the first player to reach the opposite side of the board with
a pawn.

It is obligatory to move if possible. If a player has no more moves, the
game is a draw (a tie). &gt;&gt;

Michael J�rgensen may well have come up with this independently, but it is
very nearly a non-chess representation of a chess puzzle I developed and
have been showing at clubs and tournaments for the past 20 or so years. The
only difference in outcome would be that in the chess puzzle, if neither
player can move then the player whose turn it is loses.

The position is: White has its king on g1 and pawns on a2, b2, c2, d2, f6,
and h6. Black has its king on g8 and pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, f3, and h3.

The queenside is exactly as Mr. J�rgensen, except that I'm not sure whether
he's accounting for en passant captures when he says the "pieces move like
pawns in chess". Any move on the kingside loses quickly for whoever made the
move, so the game must be settled on the queenside (which is the Touch Down
board). However if neither side can move on the queenside, in chess a losing
move on the kingside is forced.

The chess puzzle is a win for White. If the number of queenside columns with
pawns is reduced to three, then it is a win for Black. With Michael
J�rgensen's rule allowing a draw in the case of locked pawns, I suspect that
the game is a draw.

The winning strategy for White in the chess puzzle is to move a
'center-pawn' (i.e. the b- or c-pawn) two spaces, then in response to most
Black tries to move the opposite wing pawn (i.e. the d-pawn after the b-pawn
or the a-pawn after the c-pawn) on space, then to move the remaining
center-pawn two spaces.
