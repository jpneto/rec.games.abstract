The idea of location within each mini-grid both affecting the shape being
created and dictating the next mini-grid you will play in, is intriguing.

One thing I found confusing in the rules is you refer to a "group" but
never define what that means.  When I first read that "Glyphs appearing
as a subset of a larger group don't count", I thought you were merely
saying that, say, a "T" glyph scored only 5, and did not also score for
the embedded Squat-T, two Pipes, two Lines, etc.  I eventually concluded
a "group" is any orthogonally connected set of spaces belonging to a
single player (within a single mini grid), and that the rules are saying
you only score a GROUP if the ENTIRE GROUP forms one of the 19 GLYPHS.

Thus, for example, the following grid scores nothing for O (and 2 for +):

	+ O O
	O O O
	O O +

Right?
