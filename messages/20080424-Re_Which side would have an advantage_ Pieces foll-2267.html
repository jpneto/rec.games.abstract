This should be very easy to check. All chess programs worth a penny
let you set up arbitrary positions, from your description, that would
be sufficient (when setting up a king on the second row, it naturally
won't be able to castle, and a pawn on the third row won't be able to
move to the fifth). Take a seriously strong program, make it play
without an opening book, and see which side wins more often.

Anyone know how to get Fritz X to be able to accept such a
configuration?  I am having issues trying to customize positions.  I
know it is pretty balanced when Zillions runs it.

Ok, I got it it work.  I pasted a FEN(?) notation into Fritz, and then
had it run in Shootout mode.  The results so far for Near Chess are
interesting.  3 AIs, 3 different approaches to openings.  Zillions
like to move the rooks to the back row to start.  ChessV brings the
knights behind the king and queen, and Fritz drops the king behind the
king's bishop as its first move.  Will need to try Near vs Normal in
Fritz to see what the results are.
