Any game which ought to not exist in the first place, such as Twixt may be plagiarized and reformatted into a more integral organism as far as I am concerned. If Connecticut turns Twixt into something fundamentally decisive and less arbitrary then I will throw in for Connecticut over Twixt. My design agenda is fundamentally one of impartiality, thoroughly lacking in any political preoccupations. These accusations of "mafia spirit" besides being leveled at the most impervious target (me) are already disarmed by their blatant hypocrisy. I don't believe the ego has any place in the design process to begin with. You clearly do, as your primary design concern (while not actually having designed anything) is "originality". Just because no "mafia" that will have you does not mean you lack  "mafia spirit". Like most other misguided 'designers' you are blinded by the myth of the designer as artist. The only artistic license the designer can ever exercise is in diminishing the concepts he is working with through the introduction of imaginative contrivances. As far as I am concerned originality is a nuisance thing to be negotiated purely for political reasons. Desingers like myself and Luis understand that the search for better games wont countenance any personal agendae because what is a good game is a thoroughly objective matter and that more important than the good graces of a public is the mathematical integrity of a game. This is what allows us to come up with superlative games while other morons masturbate themselves over how "original" their gimmick is, even when its not.
