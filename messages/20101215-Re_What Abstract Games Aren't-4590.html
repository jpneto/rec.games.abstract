You seem to have such a high reputation of Christian Freeling's theories
about who that person is that you seem to accept them without question.
A pity, because you both are completely wrong. I know that person in
real life, and he has neither pretended to be Chinese, nor is he German,
though both of your easy acceptance of country stereotypes may well add
xenophobia to both your undesirebale traits.

Thank you :) I live in Enschede, 3 miles from the German border, go
there on a regular basis, and have quite a few friends there. On any
given Saturday Enschede is visited by many hundreds of German
visitors. We joke about stereotypes, but we don't forget the real life
occurences that gave rise to them either. There's islamophobia in the
Netherlands, yes, regrettably, but seriously suggesting that the use
of a German stereotype by a dutchman is a form of xenophobia ... well,
obviously I can't change a mind made up, but think about it.

About China, I mentioned that "speaking your mind" there may land you
in jail. The recent events surrounding the Nobel Peace Prize awarded
to Liu Xiaobo "for his long and non- violent struggle for fundamental
human rights in China" bears testimony to that.

As ever, I speak for myself and this is who I am. I don't hide behind
a virtual wall and as long as I don't know who you are I don't care
who you are. You may be the person "who knows the person personally"
for all I know. I think it's cowardice just the same.

As for the content of the threads, if you <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> cared about
abstract games, you would have had an ample choice of suject matter
lately. Instead several posters, you now inclused as far as you
weren't already, continue to take issue with personality traits, as if
nothing else counts.
