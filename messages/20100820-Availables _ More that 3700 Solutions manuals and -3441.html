If your wanted solutions manual is not in this list, also can ask me
if is available (it is a partial list). Then if you need solutions
manual only contact me by email.

"ARE NOT AVAILABLES BOOKS IN DIGITAL FORMAT", ONLY SOLUTIONS MANUALS
AND TEST BANKS.


This same "list of titles" of texts with availables solutions manual
and/or test banks is for download from :
