In "Imperial Earth", Arthur C. Clarke mentions, in fact devotes extensive
time to, a game he calls "Pentominoes".
Essentially there are 12 ways of putting together 5 identical
squares such that they all touch at least one edge to another square, there
is no overlapping, and they remain in the same plane. Out of these 12 shapes
many other shapes can be made. According to Clarke (remembering that the
book was written in 1976 and that he describes a very brute force algorithm
)  it would take 6 million, million years at a rate of 1 per second to run
through all possible combos.

I'm wondering if anyone has done any computer stuff relating to this, or
in general has seen any discussion about it.

I have seen a paper that describes a program that has found all
solutions to the problem. There are 4 rectangular lay-outs of the 12
pieces:

	3x20, 4x15, 5x12 and 6x10

There are only two solutions to the 3x20 puzzle (apart from
reflections and rotations). These are actually quite easy to find, as
there are very few possible "moves" at any given time. There are more
than 3000 different solutions to the 6x10 puzzle. In spite of the
larger number of solutions it is a lot harder than the 3x20 puzzle, as
the amount of choices is larger too. I think the exact number of
solutions to each of the four puzzles can be found in the
rec.games.puzzles FAQ.

With pentiminoes built from cubes (rather than flat squares) you can
also build a 3x4x5 box. The five long straight piece must obviously
lie along the long axis of the box, but can be in any of the 4
possible (up to reflection and rotation) positions. In 3D you can add
non-flat figures build from 5 cubes. This brings the total up to 28
pieces. The usual puzzle is to build a 5x5x5 box with three pieces
left over. To make this a bit harder, take away three random pieces
before starting. There are many other figures one can build. There is
a German company that sells these puzzles (I think they are called
"Pentacubes"). This company sets a yearly challenge of a figure to
build. My favourite puzzle is to take one piece away and construct a
copy of this (scaled 3 times up) from the remaining 27 pieces.

I build my own set from a large bag of normal dice that I got cheaply
and glued together.
