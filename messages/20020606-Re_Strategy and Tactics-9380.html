Yes, the evaluation functions in computer chess programs make
use of strategic factors.  But current evaluation functions are
generally not refined enough for strategic factors to outweigh
material factors.  If they did, computer programs would throw
away pieces in unsound sacrifices; and losing a piece is in most
positions tantamount to losing the game.  It may be a fine line
but I think it exists.

I don't think this is absoutely true, more like almost true.
For example, I don't think it would be all that surprising
if tripled pawns were worth less than a side by side pair.
Certainly it should be at least theoretically possible
for almost any chess program to think it's "up"
overall even if it's "down" a little material.
Rare, perhaps but not impossible.
