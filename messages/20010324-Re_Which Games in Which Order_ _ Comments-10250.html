Hello,



</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Chebache
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

never tried it

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Zertz
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

a fascinating game, but the games are too short! For experienced players
Zertz will eventually only consist of an opening and an endgame phase.
Might be a good game to start with.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Gipf
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

is said to have simple rules, but this is only true for the basic rules
and could be called a marketing trick. Gipf played according to the
advanced "Tournament" rules is actually a chess variant (object is to
capture one or several pre-defined pieces), although quite an unusual one.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Cathedral
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A rather primitive territory game. Might be a good starting point.



</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Quoridor
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

famous, but no experiece so far.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Octi
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A fascinating game, but it has rather complicated rules (although the
producer claims the opposite).


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
GO
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I am an experienced Go player who taught lots of Go beginners and played
at many European tournamts. I doubt that you ever will find out about the
beauties of Go or even get a faint understanding of this game without being
introduced its secrets by a strong Go player. The game is really worth
your time.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Abalone
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The player having the first move is said to have a sure win. The game
doesn't sell well after the winning strategy was published on the
internet.



</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Othello
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

is Reversi with a four move restriction and not a game in its own right,
but a plagiarism and a copyright fraud. BTW, in checker tournaments you
have a two or even a three-move restriction, and yet the game is still called
"checker". Many people think, they can't sell a game which is in the
public domain, so they do some minor change(s) (which however do not
qualify to call them new games) and sell the old PD game under a new name.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Pente
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually the Japanese traditional board game Ninuki Renju, but with
primitive backward rules that give the first player a sure win (if you
really play good).  The only true rule change compared to Ninuki Renju as
played in Japan 100 years ago is that White starts while in Japan it is
Black. Very original indeed!


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Quarto
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A very primitive game and basically a waste of  money and time unless you
are a kid, play with kids, are a chimpanzee  or are hospitalized in a
mental health institution.



</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
These are all quite new to my husband and me.  Which order should we use to
begin playing these games?  I'm not sure I want to start with the difficult
ones first.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I recommend Cathedral, then Zertz. Try to find an experienced Go player.
