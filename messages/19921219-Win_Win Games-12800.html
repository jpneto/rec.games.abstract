I'd like to gather a collection of game ideas that demonstrate
teamwork skills, cooperative risk-taking, and win-win principles.
They should have minimal rules (best if rules are self-revealing) and
be able to start up in a group in only a couple of minutes (require
very little explanation).

I'm not looking for commercial products (but I'm willing to hear
from you that have favorites; the UnGame is mine), but rather folksy
game concepts such as (these are my names):
   --- Frog-1, Frog-2:  A game where the starter does something subtle in
the
             midst of several other actions, and others in the group
attempt
             to discover the subtlty.  To "get it" a player uses the key in
             the same way as the starter so the starter can verify. 
Neither
             discloses the key by description or excessive attention.  The
             game continues until everyone discovers the key.  It has a
nice
             "end-game" since the folks catching on latest in the game have
             several folks to model the key.
   --- I Love / I Hate:  Similar to above, this is a word game where the
key
             is some feature of the words (usually repeated letters, etc.)
             that are "loved" and lacking in words that are "hated."  For
             example, "I love apples, but I hate fruit."
   --- Going on a Picnic:  Similar to above, but key is, for example, the
             first letter of the word matches the first letter of your
name.
             Example, "I'm going on a picnic, and I'm taking eggs," said
Ed,
             the starter.  Other players don't know the key, and they
attempt
             with, "I'm going on a picnic, and I'm taking cheese," says
Jill.
             "No, you can't bring cheese, Jill.  But I do want you to come
on
             my picnic.  Keep trying," says Ed.

Now, I know these are pretty weak (kindergarten) examples, and that's why
I'm
asking "rec.games" for some ideas.  They are simple, though, and that's a
plus.

If anyone has a good reference I'd like that also.  And, if you think I
should
post to some other newsgroup, please redirect me.

Thank you,
Edward
