I had the rule that players' numbers progress in the opposite orders
because, originally, I allowed any number of integers in a row/column
to add up to any integer, not specifically two integers add up. With
the original rule, player 2 could just write the same number player 1
just wrote somewhere in the same column and get at least one automatic
point each move by doing that.

Now that the rules say that exactly two numbers must add up to a third
to score a point, I actually am still fond of the reverse-order rule
anyway. It leads to the players having different strategies, although
the rule could lead to a bias (which is remedied by playing an even
number of rounds, switching who is player 1 and who is player 2, then
adding up each player's scores).

I'm reading a book right now about game-theory, and one of the things
they talk about is games where the players have different strategies.
I guess this concept influenced me.

So, there is no need to actually progress your numbers in opposite
directions, I think. But I still like the idea.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
