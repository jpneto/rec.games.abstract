Consider the following Nim games:

A) A number of pieces (all of the same color) are placed on a NxM
board. No field contains more than one piece (one might relax this
condition, but I don't believe it adds more 'depth' to the game). Two
players in turn make a move which consists of taking one or more
pieces from the board. Pieces taken in each move should come from the
same horizontal or vertical row. The player who made the last move
wins.

B) The same game as A), but now one player is restricted to moves
removing pieces from a horizontal row, and the other player is
restricted to removing pieces from a vertical row.



My questions:
1) do such games already exist?
2) can one define a general strategy for these games? I.e. using
concepts like Nim-sums, can one determine whether or not an arbitrary
position on a large board is a P-position?


Thanks,

Joe
