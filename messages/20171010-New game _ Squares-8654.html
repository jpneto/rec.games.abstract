A game is played between 2 players on a squared board 16x16 with 256 cells.
At the set up the board is empty.
Each player owns 128 tokens of his color.
So 128 blue and 128 red.
Choose who plays first.
Blue player start the game. After his turn players alternate.
On his turn a player must drop 4 tokens such as the 4 are vertices of a square kxk.
All the k`s are allowed except k=2 (2x2 is prohibited).
The last player to make legal move wins the game.

Who can force the win? the blue or the red?
Mirroring strategy will not work so do not waste your time.
This game could be played using 2 pencils of different color and a printed board.

Enjoy!
