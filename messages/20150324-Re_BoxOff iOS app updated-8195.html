Yep, Nello did a great job with Monkey Queen.  He contacted me a long time ago about it and I said sure, go ahead.  I didn't have high hopes that it would ever be done or how good it would be, only because most great plans remain exactly that.  Plans.  In this case though, the final product vastly exceeded my expectations with the fit and finish, the monkey artwork, etc.  

I actually forgot how to play Monkey Queen except that the queen shits out babies everywhere.  But I didn't remember how the babies move, or even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>if<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> they move.  Once I got into the rule sheet though, it started to come back to me.  Like, "Hmmm.  This isn't such a bad game."
