I will say, keep in mind that merely doubling everything doesn't make
a game better.  Position, balance, protecting pawns, structure, etc...
all count.

In addition, Sanny the spammer didn't even manage to double
everything.  He has twice as many men and four times as many
squares.  Anyone who has played with a variety of chess variants
knows that having a higher percentage of empty squares makes
bishops and queens more powerful while weakening knights, pawns,
and kings.  Being able to move 16 squares away also strengthens
bishops and queens against knights.

Chess is just fine the way it is.  It doesn't need fixing.

I assume you believe that Chess960 is fundamentally broken then?  And
what are your thoughts on Bughouse and Dark Chess/Kriegspiel?  Do you
see that variants are useful, but not chess, or that variants are
heresy?

Regarding how to nearly double chess, there is Millennium Chess, which
at least lays out the pieces mirror images of one another.
