Some people think I loathe game changes, which is weird.  If you've got a
way to improve your game, please, by all means do so.  To me a big part of a
game is its architecture, but another big part is obviously its gameplay,
especially if it's rich gameplay filled with strategic potential that starts
to grow from the word go.  Unexpected developments can beset the gameplay,
and usually, but not always, unexpected things are bad things.

I agree that "sand grains" come with the territory - not just for Chess
variants, but for a lot of new games.  I don't think every new game needs to
be announced with an obligatory beta notice.  Beta is for programs.  If
you've got a potentially great game that just kind of missed the mark via
unforeseeable or barely foreseeable developments in its gameplay, fuck
everyone.  Just fix the game and get on with it.

All that being said, I truly do not like rule changes, especially when I
have to make them.  It's a little embarrassing and one can reasonably expect
some good natured joshing.  Hopefully one has improved the game's quality of
play enough for everyone to forget the fleeting tomfoolery.

I guess my reputation for being game change intolerant started when Ralf
Gering released some abomination and then freaked out at the public
conspiracy not to like it.  He then started frantically modifying it, which
I found objectionable.
