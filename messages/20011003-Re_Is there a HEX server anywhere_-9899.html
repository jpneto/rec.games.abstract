You can play hex online against other humans at any of the
following three sites.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.playsite.com/">http://www.playsite.com/</a>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://playsite.lycos.com/">http://playsite.lycos.com/</a>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://newtongames.com/home.html">http://newtongames.com/home.html</a>

The last site hasn't been advertised yet because it is still under
development.  Consequently, the site is usually empty.  It does
have more options as far as board size is concerned and the board
looks nicer than the other two sites.  Once the site gets finished
and advertised, hopefully people will start playing there.  Also,
the site is supposed to eventually have Twixt. To my knowledge,
there are as of yet no places to play twixt online (other than email).

Relatively few people seem to know hex so it is common to go to
either of the first two sites and find people playing other games
but nobody playing hex.  Which is a real shame because Hex is an
excellent game that deserves to better known.
