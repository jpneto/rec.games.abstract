[Before "Senor" - Fall 1978]

 I was riding on a train one time through Mexico, travelling up
north to San Diego; and I must have fell asleep on this train and I
woke up and it was about midnight...and the train had stopped at a
place called Monterrey... This bunch of children were getting off the
train, this family - there must have been about seventeen children
and a mother and father and they were getting off the train. And at
the time I was watching it all through the glass; it was dark outside
so the whole side of the train was like a mirror. So I was watching
it all happen and I saw this old man stumble up onto the train and he
gets onto the car; and he was walking down and he took a seat right
across the car from me. I felt a vibration in the air. I turned to
look at him and I could see he wasn't dressed in anything but a
blanket; he was just wearing a blanket. He must have been 150 years
old. I turned around to look at him and I could see both his eyes
were burning out - they were on fire and there was smoke coming out
of his nostrils. I said, "Well, this is the man I want to talk to."
