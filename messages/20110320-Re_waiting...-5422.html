One note about voting.
After discussing the 100 point method for voting with
various potential judges I've concluded that it's probably
not such a good idea in this instance.  If one judge really
likes one game he can give that game 100 points just to
make sure it wins.  This really sucks if the other judges
try to distribute their points in a fair way.

Yep, agreed.

I can add this to the ballot side by side with a different
voting system if anyone is truly attached to this method.

Nah.  That would just fuck up the contest.  One game wins under one voting
system and another game wins under another voting system....  yuck.

The method that I think suits the contest best is simply
writing the games in order from favorite to least favorite.
This reflects also the sentiment that people are picking
their "favorite game" and not one which meets a
'stacking criteria' or some other fabricated standards.
A list also forces a logical distribution of point value
without having to fiddle with numbers as a voter.

Yep.

so can I get a "oh yeah. let's definitely use the list
method" from someone?

The only drawback to the list method is its vulnerability to draws.  More
judges and an odd number of judges would help with this.  I think five
judges would prevent a three way tie.  Haven't put a lot of thought into
that though.

So, and just for clarity, how would the list system work exactly?  Like, a
judge's first choice is given 10 points, second choice is given 9 points,
etc?  Maybe it doesn't matter too much, but I'd rather iron out the details
ahead of time to hopefully preempt the inevitable complaint tsunami from
Christian.

Just kidding, Christian  :D   I am getting a little worried though about
your uncharacteristic silence.  I know you're still alive because you're
still making moves in our Monkey Queen game at MindSports.
