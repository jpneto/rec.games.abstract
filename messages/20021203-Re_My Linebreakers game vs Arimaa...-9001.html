But anyway, the point is that since the Zillions developers themselves have
developed the "AI" behind their engine, it should be up to them to format
the rules that engine follows in playing the game.  Mr. Syed really can't be
expected to write the optimal ruleset, if not for reasons of personal bias,
then for reasons of expertise.  Was that clear?  It's 4:30 a.m. here, and
I've been screwing around with Zillions for hours.....

That was clear :) If the Zillions engine takes the Lisp rules
as is without doing some kind of internal adaptation for the
AI algorithms, then it can be expected that different ways of
coding the rules will bring different behaviors for the AI.

This is one of the big problems in game AI, and AI in general:
how to represent everything in a useful way - humanly speaking,
in a meaningful way. Have you noticed how awkward the rule
books can look once you've become familiar with a game? We
construe a totally different system in our heads.

As for Arimaa, I've come to perceive the board and the pieces
a bit like the naive representation of gravity in general
relativity, you know, the rubber film with the marbles that
make hollows.
