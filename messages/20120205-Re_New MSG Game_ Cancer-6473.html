Some actual discussion, of an actual game, on its actual merits? Can
this really be? Dare I hope for more of this?

Well I just played Cancer for the first time, and, according to Luis,
it plays like Go (what a surprise).  So maybe Cancer can be considered
a Go variant after all.  Of course we'll have to clear this with a non-
native English speaking European such as Christian or Ralf.

The one thing that diverges from Go is precisely the fact that you can
fill any opponent's eyes. This may give the use of cancer stones some
legitimacy, in the sense that it not only does it serve its prosaic
purpose of avoiding cycles, but it also defines the character of the
game.

Having played only once, I can't tell for sure yet, but my impression
is that this rule doesn't break the game, which was my main (and
vague) concern. Unlike in Go, groups with only one-point eyes, no
matter how many of them, are easy prey, but when they're captured, the
surrounding group ensures life for quite a long time, and it's
impractical for the opponent to try and kill it while there are still
things going on elsewhere.

Also, simultaneous capture aligns well with the no-pass rule.
Sequential capture would mean that seki situations would be always
solved in favour of the player whose turn it isn't when there are no
more empty points available, which seems random and unfair. With
simultaneous capture, all groups involved in a seki are captured, and
parity doesn't play any role.
