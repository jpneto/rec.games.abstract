Hi,
      a while back there was some discussion about the game of Mah Jong. So
therefore for those who are interested I have posted my list of hands from my
book "101 Illustrated Mah Jong Hands". Unfortunately these do not have any
illustrations but all the info is there. Some re-formatting will be necessary.
If you have any questions/comments please email them to me as I will be unable
to keep track of the net due to the fact of upcoming exams!!!!
Have fun
      Dave Warner.

---- BEGIN LIST ----


5. PURITY HAND                 
Score: 3 DOUBLES PLUS EXTRAS
Any one suit.                                               
No Winds or Dragons.            
Pungs or Kongs and a Pair                
A Chow may be substituted for a Pung.         
If all tiles including the last are drawn from the wall the
    hand scores 2 extra doubles for concealed Mah Jong.

1.  It is American Mah-jong, which is more Gin-Rummy than Mah-jong.
   Too many special (limit) hands which allows going out with
   other than "4 sets and a pair" pattern.  Also clumsy antique
   point-based scoring rules (most modern Asian rules are "doubles-
   based").  The numerous patterns do not have a strong consistency
   among themselves to be easily remembered.

2.  Almost all the patterns are "one suit"!  "Cleared suit"

IMHO, if anyone is wondering why Mah-jong has not become as popular
a game in America as it is in Asia, I can flatly tell you that it
is because of the American "adaptation".  They totally changed the
concept of the game and make it play like a modified version of
Gin Rummy.  Also, the scoring rules are more complex than those
commonly used in Asia, and the game is less playable.

The list IMO consists mainly of infrequent "limit patterns" which
have little impact of the game, but each one must be remembered
by the players and does not add to the flavor of the game.

"Cleared suit" mah-jong is IMO never as fun as the original game.

I agree, I dislike American-type rules (mind you I'm not American :-)) 
in which it's easy to get a limit - they should be fairly, although 
not impossibly, rare.  Otherwise if you don't look like getting one you're 
forced to keep chowing to get a fast MJ so you don't end up paying out. 

But I don't see any point in getting cross about Dave Warner's posting, it was 
nice of him to make the information available, and for those people who are 
into American type versions (presumably there are some, e.g., those who also 
like gin rummy) it will I guess be a helpful resource.
