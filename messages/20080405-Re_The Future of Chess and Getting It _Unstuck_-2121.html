For the record, when I say that chess is fine the way it is or 
that chess isn't broken and does not need fixing, I am referring 
to Articles 1 through 14 of the FIDE Laws of Chess as documented 
at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE101">http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE101</a>, except 
where those articles assume that every game has an arbiter; two 
players need to be able to play a game without outside assistance 
and yet still have a defined set of rules.  I have no problem 
with different kinds of clocks, tournament scoring systems, rating 
schemes, or anything else other than the rules that two players 
need to know to play a game against each other.  I also have no 
problem with chess variants, or with one of the variants becoming 
more popular than chess.  What I object to is someone trying to 
change the rules that determine how the game is played.
