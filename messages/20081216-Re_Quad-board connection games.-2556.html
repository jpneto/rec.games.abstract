Off the top of my head:


1) The game "TRELLIS" is played on a checkered board. BLACK connects
diagonally across only DARK squares, WHITE only across LIGHT squares.

This allows black and white paths to cross, so it would violate the
principle of a filled board having only one winner.

3) The game "ONYX" suggests several methods that are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opposite<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of first

This suggests to me several ways that might work on a 4444:


3a) Play only on cells. No captures. Player who completes a 2x2 checkerboard
wins the connection. Vertex is marked to show this.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This could work, as does the first-come, first-connect.  I can't
really see if any of these will make a filled board have a winner (but
paths certainly can't cross).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3b) As above, but diagonal connections are automatic, immediate and good
until overridden.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ditto.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3c) As (3a) with captures. No play whatsoever on vertices. ALL connections
are orthogonal.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This looks like it could create infinite play.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
3d) As (3b)+(3c) Diagonal connections are immediate.

3e) Full-on Onyx rules. The only way to get a vertex and connect diagonally
is to play a stone on a vertex. This may ONLY be done if all four squares
around it are empty. Completing a 2x2 checkerboard captures both enemy
stones.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Capture look like potential infinite play.

However, I don't generally like having to explicitly play
vertices/corners.  This makes the board not really a square grid, but
a square/octagon grid.  I have a few suggestions for how to avoid
this:

 1. Use a checker board.  Only black-to-black corners connect
    (regardless of who plays them).  This makes black squares more
    valuable than white squares, but this is symmetrical for both
    players.  This topologically equivalent to a square/octagon grid,
    but avoids plays on corners.

 2. Allow only three out of four squares in a 2x2 to be filled.
    Diagonals automatically connect.  A board is "filled" when no more
    pieces can be played without completing a 2x2.

Option two seems most interesting to me.
