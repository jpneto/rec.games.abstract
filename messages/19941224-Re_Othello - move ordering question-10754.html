I've been poking around with optimal play on reduced Othello boards, and
trying to make my tree search efficient enough to get up to interesting
sizes.  After incorporating alpha-beta and large transposition tables,
it's usual to add the killer heuristic (which I haven't done yet) and
then try to get as close to perfect ordering on the move generations as
possible, to let alpha-beta do its thing with maximal efficiency.

I thought before I went into the tricky stuff like reducing the opponent's
mobility or trying for known good patterns, I'd try something dead simple:
if there's a corner move, take it; otherwise try all the moves in
numerical order (like a TV scan across the board).

Oddly, this degraded the tree-searching performance dramatically from
just leaving the moves in numerical order, although it of course ends up
with the same result.

Could a human Othello player comment on this?  I thought perhaps retaining
the threat of moving into a corner might be more effective than grabbing
it immediately; does this correspond to a known human strategy?

Here's a strategy I invented--it seems to be fairly powerful, at least
against middling players.

The best squares to play into are those which are an even number of
spaces from an edge (0 is even). The worst are those which are an
odd number of spaces from an edge. These effects are strongest closer
to the edges. I haven't tried playing this purely mechanically--
I'd look a few moves ahead to get my pieces into the even squares
or force my opponents pieces into the odd ones.

This strategy is incomplete--I told a friend about it, and he lost
a game by getting the edges and leaving me practically all the
pieces in the middle. 

On second reading, I haven't answered your question, but this
strategy might be simple and numerical enough to be worth checking
out.
