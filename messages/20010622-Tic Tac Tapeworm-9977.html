For those of you who play my 4-D tic tac toe program (I know there are
at least 2 :-) ),  I've upgraded it with some stronger
AIs to waste your CPU cycles.  I've also added a
feature to allow you to arbitrarily place Xs and Os in
case you maybe want to give yourself an edge,  or just feel like
seeing what happens in a given position.  In case anyone's interested,
a discussion of my development process follows.

	Riverman was complaining about how crappy
my 4-D TTT AIs were a while back (actually,  he just wasn't
convinced that they demonstrated a win for the first player,  but
I see insults everywhere these days) so I decided to try to
improve them.  I kind of figured that I could get a lot of
performance enhancement with a little effort by optimizing my
parameters
and putting in a little look ahead.
	This turns out to be completely backwards:  because
I had written Typhus and Roid to only evaluate the immediate
position,  it turned out there was quite a lot of effeort involved
giving it look-ahead,  and it gave almost no performance gain.
I had originally rejected the idea of doing look-ahead because
the branching ratio was so large (625 first moves!),  but I had
the insight that so many of these moves obviously suck that
I could probably just initially do a typhus-like evaluation
and just search the ten or so most promising moves at each
level.  The result of this was Rhea.  It turns out that Rhea almost
always makes the move it considered best in its preliminary analysis
anyway.  
	Another thing that didn't help much was setting up a
"tournament"
program which played variations of the AI against each other and
fiddled with the parameters.  It turns out that the original
parameters I just pulled out of my ass weren't that bad,
and that the quality of play isn't that sensitive to the precise
values
of the parameters anyway.
	So the next thing I tried was to simplify down to 3-D
to see if I could get any insights.  I had very reliable information
saying that 4X4X4 TTT is a forced win for the first player (saw it
on the web somewher),  and since the branching ratio is "only"
64 I thought maybe I could conclusively demonstrate this. This
actually
helped,  although not directly.  A branching ratio
of 64 is still too high to search more than a few ply into
the future.  The program didn't see certain wins which I clearly
could;
it would build up these blocks of 4 in the center of a plane,
and this is clearly a winning pattern to a human,  since if you
just start moving accross the bottom of the plane,  each move you make
threatens an immediate win and so must be blocked,  and the third
threatens two wins at once.
	Thinking about it some more made me realize it didn't have to
be the center four,  the four corners work,  4 guys in one corner
work,  even two guys on the bottom edge and two on the top
edge will work.  This was good for me;  complicated pattern analysis
makes my head hurt and hence is indirectly bad for my liver,  but 
counting is easy.  All I had to do was count X's and O's in each
plane and give appropriate bonuses for plane scores.  The resultant
AI I called Tapeworm (tapeworms and planes are both flat,  get it?).
	Tapeworm proved to be much stronger tha Rhea in the 3-D case.
I put the 3-D version up on my website also in case anyone wants
to play,  BTW.  There are only 18 planes to check,  and it doesn't
take that big an edge in a plane to have a forced win.
	Didn't work as well in the 4-D case.  It's still definately
better than Rhea,  but the advantage is smaller.  There are 
I think 278 planes to check (the AI actually only considers 270 of
them,
150 "perpendicular" and 120 "diag1".  Coding for the diag2 planes
seemed like more trouble than it's worth) so it takes a lot longer,
and you need to get a 9-0 edge in a plane to have an obvious forced
win.
	Of course,  it's "obvious" that the next thing to try is to
try to score for having a majority in a cube.  In the extremely
likely event that I have nothing better to do in the near future,
I  might try this.  The main sticking point (aside from the utter
futility
of it all) is that I was having trouble thinking of a cool name,
probably because I was thinking spaces (intead of cubes),  and
extension
of planes (which really should be squares;  I had been thinking
of the individual spaces where you move as squares,  but of course
they
actually should be points).  So now I have my name:  Brick.
	BTW,  I ran tapeworm through the tournament procedure also,
and again I don't think it helped much.  But maybe I just didn't
run it long enough,  I only ran it about three days on my new machine.
I could be running it for like months on the old machine,
it's not doing anything right now and I really ought to
help do my part to help California get over its power glut.
