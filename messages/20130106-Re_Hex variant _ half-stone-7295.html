Dude, it's not Trisq and Trivor.  It's Trisq and Tripen, between which there's a clear link.

Luis has already admitted to this.
"Right. I acknowledge that [Mark Steere was] the first to release a game with variable orientation, asymmetric cell division."

Pay attention, Corey.  You're fucking up the discussion by leaping in as the big drunken hero, while having no clue what's actually being discussed.  What are you, Luis' boyfriend?  Luis is a big boy.  Why don't you just let him speak for himself.

I don't even find them similar games. Also I was drunk on January

Yeah, well maybe lay off the booze, Corey.  It's not "frankness".  It's weaselly shit publicly broadcasting what was presumed to be a private conversation.

If I want to gloat, that's my prerogative.  Nobody has my standard of originality.  I don't knowingly borrow others' ideas, but just about everyone has borrowed mine, including you and Luis.  I accidentally used Greg van Patten's ideas from Metamorphosis in Mosaic.

Why don't I use others' ideas?  Because there's no need to.  There's a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>huge<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ocean of concepts as yet undiscovered.  You just have to work for it and don't be lazy.  It's as simple as that.
