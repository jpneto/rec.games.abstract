It's sorting.

The easiest argument is aimed at those who believe that intelligence exists, is
measurable, and that IQ is at least a reasonable facsimile to the true
measurement.  Then Terman's researches starting in the 30s (basically, that high
IQ people do well at everything) indicate that those who do well at calculus
will also do well at math.

Probably more realistically, few students can get through the whole calculus
sequence without doing some work.  So we (pretty much) require students to show
they can do at least a little work before allowing them to take a math course
that will require them to think.  (Have to work before you can think?)

And I doubt that abstract reasoning is inhibited by computation.  Children (and
adults too, for that matter) are pretty resilient.  It takes lots and lots of
bad teaching to undo our natural desires.  And very, very lots to completely
bury them.
