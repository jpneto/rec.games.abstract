I think Mark would agree that this is all for the wrong reasons. A
rule like that is totally arbitrary. Chess is so nauseatingly
forgiving that almost anything is 'playable'.

The Atlantis triplets try to create a tactical miniature chess world
with some internal consistency. Shakti and Cyclix feature the most
logical king in an Atlantis environment: it covers the first tile in
any of the 8 main directions. Barring a 'Slime Chess' variant you need
pieces. The two Shakti pieces follow their king in terms of
simplicity.
Given the bare minimum of pieces, giving only the king the right to
capture pieces but excluding mutual capture between pieces is logical.
The arbitrary aspect is giving the pieces the right to remove tiles,
rather than the king. But that was a given thing, because I only
realized Shakti was a Chess variant after it had emerged in the
invention process. It seemed so complete in itself that I felt no need
to tamper with it.

But it led to Caïssa. Het I rooted the mechanism of doom in the king
itself: the tile it vacates is removed - period. The king moves like a
Queen (even is called 'the Queen') to provide speed and to give it the
ability to cover its pieces long range, or attack the opponent's long
range. But if in check it is restricted to the king's move - to pin it
down and attack from a distance without need for cover.
The pieces breathe the quest for the "unarbitrary": the two main
directions rook and bishop, and a third piece that covers the first
squares missed by those two. The quest to give the bishop the full
domain led to the 'exchange' rule.

Cyclix's way to achieve that is rooted in the 'recycle' process. Again
it has a set of pieces that is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>as unarbitrary as possible<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>! That's
why the comparison to Pocket Chess misses the point (even apart from
the fact that the Atlantis triplets are tactical miniatures that have
very little in common with Chess to begin with). The only new feature
is that it is the first Atlantis variant where pieces <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>can<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> capture
one another in the usual way, due to the recycling process that was
inspired by MQ.

P.S.
A real fun variant would be "Pocket King" ;-)
