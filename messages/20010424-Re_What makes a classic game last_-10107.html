Go, checkers, and nine men's morris also have that refuge.  Other strategy
games (e.g., chess) adopt variants along with (sometimes) bigger boards.

I guess I agree that tournament play would be unappealing if it was mainly
just a question of who could best memorize a database.  As a novice chess
player, I'm still just trying to learn &amp; apply basic principles, and get to
where blundering is a rarity for me.  I don't mind some memorizing:  I
memorize openings &amp; basic endgames, for instance.  If I ever got good enough
that it became important for me to study computer analyses and such, maybe
I'd lose interest in the game; I don't know.  Guess I'll cross that bridge
if I ever come to it--but I don't expect that to happen in this lifetime.
