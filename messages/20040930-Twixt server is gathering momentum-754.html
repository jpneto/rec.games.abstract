More and more players are starting to show up on the Twixt
server at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.k2z.org/">http://www.k2z.org/</a>

Around 3 to 5 pm East Coast US time, which is 9 to 11 pm 
Central European time, is when players tend to meet,
although the server is available 24/7. Clients are
available in Windows and Java versions. There are lots of
new cool features such as improved post mortem analysis,
a variety of time controls, and a logout message board
that shows you who was online in the past 6 hours. Players
who just missed each other might be able to hook up again
later. And the usual bells and whistles are still there:
a rating system, row handicapping option, and the complete
and correct ruleset including the swap rule and the option
to remove your own links.

I hope to see you there!
