BTW, a minor, trivial point about the positions

play the game". Seriously, we look at question

Initially, there was no move and no issue.

Ok -- it's your game, so you make the rules, but I think the recursive
analysis is cleaner if the game is over whenever there's a balance,
even if right away.

The 2-plate injustice is more complicated.
In the position:

(P0)  a  0

the first player is lost for a=1
and wins if a &gt; 1 (for a=0 there is
no game--there should be at least 1 stone
on one of the plates).

In the position

(P0)    a  1

the first player is lost for a=0
and wins if a &gt; 0.

Continue with the 2-plate injustice.

(P0)  a  b

where, say,  a &gt;/ b &gt; 1. Neither player
wants to leave a configuration  A  B,
where min(A B) &lt; 2, except for the winning
configurations  1  0  and  0  1, or else
the opponent on the next move will be able
to reach  1  0  or  0  1, and win.

We see that position:

(P0)  2  2

is lost for the first player.

If you change the rules to allow initial positions to be terminal if
they balance, then (2,2) would be a win for player 1.

It follows that position

That's not so clear. In fact, I think (3,2) is a loss for player 1.

But that's only because of your initialization special case rule --
another reason to undo that.

Etc., i.e., by induction, we get the
following modest theorem:

THEOREM  The 2-plate injustice game, with the
=======  initial position:

(P0)  a  b

is won for the first player in each of the
following cases:

(i) a =/= b, and min(a b) &gt; 1 -- then
passing to position  (P1) min(a b) min(a b)
is the winning move);

For injustice, that would be a losing move. In fact, it would be
instant suicide.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

For Injustice with 2 plates, here is the correct resolution (I think):

The losing initial positions are:
       
    (a,a) where a&gt;=2 where a is even
    (a,a+1), (a+1,a) where a is even.

All other initial positions are winning.

If you change the rules so that, for Injustice, balanced initial
positions are immediately winning for player 1, then the losing
initial positions are:

   (a,a+1), (a+1,a) where a is even.

All other initial positions are winning.

The reason for the proposed rule change is simplicity and consistency.

For example, assuming the rule change, for Injustice, you get the
following:

No need to bar (0,0) as an initial position. The game is over, player
1 wins.

The initial position (2,2) is a <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>win<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> for player 1, not a loss.

Thus, (2,2) is a win for whatever player receives it, regardless of
whether it's an initial position or a position received during play.

In general, the proposed rule change would imply that the status of a
position depends only on the position, not on whether it is initial or
not.

Hence, I strongly recommend changing the rules so as to declare
balanced positions terminal. The status of such balanced initial
positions would be the same as if player 2 had just finished moving.
Thus, for Justice, a balanced initial position would be a win for
player 2, and for Injustice it would be a loss for player 2.
