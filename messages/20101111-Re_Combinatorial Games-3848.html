Well a great  argument all around Mark but it's not going to bring
anyone back to this site.

So, the throngs of people you frightened off with your sharp wit are still
too intimidated to return.  Is that where we're at?  Clark, let me explain
something to you.  The only effect you've had on rec.games.abstract since
your recent arrival is that people who were already repulsed by the
stupidity of Bill Taylor and Harald Korneliussen are now additionally put
off by your stupidity.  Repulsive stupidity is not a bragging point, Clark.

Where do you think Christian Freeling is? He's on my site, you stupid
twat! Where do you think the contest is being organized? None other
than RGC. I offered them sanctuary from an existence as troll pellets
and they came in droves.
