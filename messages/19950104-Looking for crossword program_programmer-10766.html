Hi,

I create (what some call "set") and sell crossword puzzles on a casual
basis and have for many years.  A couple of years ago, I bought a very nice
CD-ROM containing a number of New York Times puzzles but, more importantly,
also containing a program to create a crossword grid.  It allows you to
create grids of any size (15 squares by 15, 23x23, whatever), it adds black
squares in the correct "reverse symmetry" style (your puzzle should look
the same upside down as it does rightside up) and numbers the squares. 
It's a terrific aid, and speeds up construction.

What it does NOT is contain a dictionary.  I want to know if there is a
program that has both elements: ONE, the power to create a grid, insert
black squares correctly and number the squares, and TWO, a dictionary,
especially one that has two "missing letters" powers (IE: allows you to
enter something like:
_ _ N U _ _ R _ _ and get all the words which fit that pattern.

There are programs that do each.  I have 'em.  What I'm looking for is a
program that does BOTH on the same screen.  Help!

I'm either searching for a program which does this, or a programmer willing
to develop such a program under contract for me.

Please reply to e-mail address <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:haibeck@infomatch.com">"haibeck@infomatch.com"</a>
