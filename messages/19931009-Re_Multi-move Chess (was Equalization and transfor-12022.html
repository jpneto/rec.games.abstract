 	I have some time tonight, and also WGR#10 handy, so here follows a
list of multi-move chess variants:

Marseillais Chess
	2 moves per turn. If check is given with the first move, the second is
	not played. Check must be removed on one's first move. A king may not
	be moved into check.
Balanced Marseillais Chess
	Like Marseillais, except that White's first turn consists of only one
	move.
Doublemove chess
	2 moves per turn. The object is to capture the king. Check is ignored,
	so kings can move across/onto attacked squares. White's first turn con-
	sists of only one move.
Citizen Chess
	2 moves per turn, of which the first must be made with a piece and the
	optional second must be made with a pawn.
Triplets Chess
	3 moves per turn. One of the moves must be made with a king, another
	with a pawn, and the third with any other piece. A player who cannot do
	all 3 moves on her turn loses. This is the only CV I know of which con't	end in a draw (except by agreement).
Quest-Chess
	10 moves per turn (5 on White's first); a game based on Conquest.

Swarm Chess
	Every unit must be moved once per turn, if possible.
Sputnik Chess
	Any R, B, or N in the opponent's half of the board is a sputnik. On a
	player's turn, she moves any number of sputniks plus a non-sputnik.
Threesum Chess
	A player moves up to three units on a turn, but they can only move a
	total of three squares.
Multimove Dice Chess
	A die is rolled on each turn to determine the number of moves allowed
	for that turn (up to four).

Scottish Progressive Chess
	White makes one move, Black makes two, White makes three, and so on. A
	player's turn ends if she gives check before the end of the series.
Scottish Modern Chess
 	Like Scottish, except that a turn ends any time when a unit ends its
	move on an attacked square.
English Progressive Chess
	Like Scottish, except that a player can't move a unit n times until all
	other units have been moved at least n-1 times on that turn.
