I've made a new game, a completion of what now constitutes 'the
Atlantis triplets': Shakti, Caïssa and Cyclix. All three are miniature
chess games based on the 'Atlantis mechanism': a board shrinking by
the conditional removal of cells of the playing area, causing one king
or the other to find himself without refuge.

The Atlantis mechanism isn't new. There are at last two commercial
games of the severties/eighties that feature it: Eric Solomon's Alaska
and Bernd Kienitz's Isola(tion).
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1387/alaska">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1387/alaska</a>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1875/isolation">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1875/isolation</a>

Isola in particular is less than mindboggling, and a quest to turn it
in something more interesting resulted in Shakti. Since Shakti has
only three pieces, a king and two warriors, mutual capture of warriors
is excluded: the pieces are needed on the board.
It's removal mechanism of squares is embedded in the warriors. That
wasn't a deliberate plan: Isola had turned into a chess game
unintentionally, and once it had emerged as Shakti, it combined
minimalism, completeness and consistency.

Shakti led to the realization that a chesstype game and the Atlantis
effect were on affectionate terms. The only thing I found thematically
dissatisfactory was the fact that the seeds of doom provided by the
disappearing cells were not sown by the king itself but by the
warriors. Hence came Caïssa, were the king 'gives birth' to the very
holes that will eventually seal its fate.
Caïssa, like Shakti, implicitly needs the few pieces it has, to be on
the board. Mutual capture between the pieces is not an option, or so I
thought, so I devised the innovative 'capture by exchange', which is
in fact no capture at all. Within the framework of Caïssa it works
like a Swiss watch.

It took a couple of decades till the third leaf on this tiny branch of
the chess tree emerged. The game that triggered it by providing a
mechanism was Mark Steere's Monkey Queen. Not by using it as a
'birthing mechanism', as Mark calls it, but as a 'recycle mechanism'.
As it happens, Cyclix uses the Shakti king with the three Caïssa
pieces, a rook, a bishop and a knight. Captured pieces return to the
original side and can be 'endlessly' recycled using the king as a
portal: the tile a king vacates may, conditionally, sprout a
previously captured piece that player has 'in hand'.

Although there are only three pieces, the recycling process is not
limited by that number. Finitude is not provided by the amount, but by
the Atlantis effect. What the recycling process provides is mutual
capture between pieces. That's where Cyclix differs from Shakti and
Caïssa. In Cyclix you can risk being captured if it serves a tactical
purpose, because you get the piece back 'in hand'. It may be hard to
get it back onto the board, because a king that captures and/or moves
out of check can not be used as a portal, but that too is part of the
tactical deliberations. Cyclix is a full member of a small eccentric
family, the 'Atlantis triplets', and I'm very satisfied with the way
it turned out.

But that <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> not be the case with everybody. This is from the MQ
thread where Mark remarks:

[quote]
"Btw the 'birthing mechanism' of Monkey Queen can certainly be used in
other games as a way to introduce pieces into play, just as the
merging mechanism of Mad Bishops can be used. The Mad Bishops
mechanism is interesting but not my greatest ever, and I encourage
other designers to use it.
Something like the Monkey Queen mechanism though is closer to my
heart. Subtle mechanisms for fluid, seemingly infinite games which are
actually finite are hard to come up with. I really do hate variants
which appropriate my more interesting mechanisms.
I know there's no ill intent on the part of my fellow designers, but
it's like someone created a clone of my infant for the express purpose
of hacking off its arms, legs and head with a machete. I repeat
something that I've called upon designers to do many, many times in
the past. Please use something other than an MSG game as the basis for
your game (unless it's the Mad Bishops mechanism or something that
you've cleared with me first)."
[end quote]

I've looked at this from various sides and distances and with
different lighting, but somehow the name 'Cyclix' kept shining
through. I'll refrain from commenting on its similarities and
differences with MQ, since these are clear enough. Instead I'd like to
comment on the sources of the 'birth mechanism'.

Mark confided in private mail of January 6th: "My new "stacking" (?)
game bears an obvious resemblance to your MonkeyTrap. As a tribute, I
wanted to call it Monkey Queen", and if I was comfortable with that.
Of course I was. Monkey Trap happened accidentally, but it is itself
an obvious derivative of Amazons, so who am I. In both games, pieces
vacating a cell 'give birth' to offspring, but not <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>live<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> offspring.

Live offspring is the key idea, obviously, and using one piece as a
birth canal is a new implementation.
Or is it?

Several games feature breeding live offspring. Of my own games I
mention Phalanx as a clear example of a mechanism featuring birth and
movement:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-field/468-phalanx">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-field/468-phalanx</a>
Caïssa literally features a Queen as the absolute piece, and this
queen 'gives birth' to a hole on the cell it vacates, every time it
moves. A hole is not a baby, but the mechanism is completely similar.

Even taken the two together, breeding a live baby on a vacated cell,
has a precedent in Mu:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-field/470-mu">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-field/470-mu</a>
[quote]
"If the exploding cell does not form a last bridge between two
sections of the Commonwealth, it either creates or expands such a
section. In that case the cell sprouts one new man, immediately after
the explosion, that is put onto the cell."
[end quote]
This may not be immediately obvious without the context, the rules of
Mu. If you cannot understand the concept of Mu from its rules, you're
in abundant company. Seven billion people can't be wrong, now can
they? ;-)

Mu features the Atlantis mechanism in that the top layer of the board,
called 'Virginity', is cleared to reveal the bottom layer called 'the
Commonwealth'. The clearing mechanism are 'explosions': a virgin cell
explodes if and when the stack it contains reaches capacity. After the
stack thus vacates the cell, the top tile is removed and the cell
gives birth to a new man.
As Mark remarked: "The 'birthing mechanism' of Monkey Queen can
certainly be used in other games as a way to introduce pieces into
play". Except that it actually already had been used.

In conclusion:
You can claim a game, but not a mechanism. Best shot is a mechanism
that quintessentially leads to one game. Mark's Oust comes to mind
here as one of the very few. But using a piece to generate pieces is
not a quintessential mechanism but a nice tool. Digging through BGG I
bet more than a few games employ similar mechanisms, and Mu even
features one that is a bit more than 'similar'.

Of course I've mentioned MQ as an inspiration for Cyclix in 'How I
invented games and why not':
