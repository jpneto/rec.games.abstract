Are the users supposed to peer and reach into the box, in order to

No.  There's no need to cut the box out and construct it.  But if you
were to do so, you would fold the side arms <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>down<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> so the hex pattern

This is essentially a two-dimensional game. It is equivalent to the

Let the blue lines outline the cells which may be played in here.

I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.  If you
have a cardboard box and you smash it flat, you will create a two
dimensional shape like the one I've created for Box Hex.  Likewise if
you have a box made of rubber sheeting, you can stretch the opening
outward and downward to morph it into a two dimensional shape with
larger cells around the outside like the drawing you provided (thank
you for that).  In both cases, the game maintains the topographic
characteristics of its original three dimensional shape:  Number one,
the shortest connection paths are around the outside of the middle
area, not through the middle area.  Number two, there are four shortest
paths - two for each player - much different from the one shortest
connection path you have in regular Hex, a path which is shared by both
players.  No matter how you morph the (three dimensional) box in Box
Hex, its topographic characteristics will persist.

As an experienced Hex player, I don't see that you have eliminated the
need for the pie rule at all. The advantage of the first move is a
TEMPO asymmetry, not a board asymmetry. So, your new version
makes play around the four corner cells more important. Suppose
the first player has the solid circle border rows on your grid. As the
first player, I am sure that playing in the cell marked with a purple
dot (or probably almost any central cell) would lead to an easy win.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I am not an experienced Hex player.  I've only played once and was
quickly beaten.  I remember my experienced opponent's first move was in
the center.  Even an inexperienced player of Hex can make some basic
observations.  The well known strong first move advantage in Hex is due
to a tempo asymmetry and a board <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>symmetry<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  There is only one
shortest connection path in Hex, as I mentioned.  This path is shared
by both players.  An obvious deduction is that control of the center is
paramount, whether you define "center" as the center point (in which
case the first move player simply claims it), or the center small area
(in which case the first move player easily dominates it).

I'm not claiming that Box Hex is free of first (or second) move
advantage.  No game is.  My claim is that with Box Hex's four shortest
paths (two for each player), all of which travel around the center (not
through it), the simple symmetry of regular Hex is defeated, and the
overwhelming emphasis on regular Hex's center area is greatly
alleviated, as is Hex's powerful first move advantage.  My claim that
the pie rule is not needed in Box Hex may prove to be a tad ambitious.
Time, extensive play testing, and statistics will determine that.
Please don't be offended, but I doubt your claim that the cell you
marked in the center area of the Box Hex board would provide a
tremendous advantage.

There have been plenty of alternate maps suggested for Hex.

Thank you for providing these links.  The boards are beautiful to
behold.  Other variants of Hex have also been brought to my attention.
So far, Box Hex is the only Hex variant I'm aware of which is
essentially three dimesional.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pie rule is recommended for all these variants.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

As with standard Hex, their single shortest paths travel right through
the center, making the pie rule an immediate necessity, even for
beginners.
