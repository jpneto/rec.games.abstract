And many agree.  There were back when I was playing 
people who complained when a couple of multigamists
would play games other than chess at the chess club
or as skittles between rounds at a tournament site.
We simply ignored them, as is the proper course.
 
Frankly I could have done with most of the posts about 
the checkers championship in either group.  At the same
time, I think that people in computer chess can provide
insights into the issues involved in computer checkers
and viceversa.  
 
You will notice that the messages I personally have 
cross-posted affect both games.  One that I did not
(mostly to avoid wasting my time with people like you)
had three points, one of which has an implication
for computer chess.  I will repeat it here in a cross-post
because I strongly feel that there are common issues:
 
****************************************************************
 
When a computer program enters a tournament or wins a title, how
does one determine when it is the same program? If the source
code is licensed and two independent programmers improve it,
which is the champion?  What if the entire program is copied,
but the computer learns from playing itself or others? 
Should the copies inherit the rating of the original?
 
*****************************************************************
 
I played in my first tournament in 1961, and over the years,
until I quit organized chess in 1982, I observed a fight
in the chess community between multigamists and those who 
believe Caissa is a jealous mistress, and exhibit their outrage
at infidelity on her behalf.  This is reflected in the fact that
many of the earlier popularizers of American chess were also
players of other games (Horowitz, Edward Lasker, Reinfeld, etc.)
whereas many of the more recent wave have disliked the
connection being made.  
 
The understanding of chess, culturally, psychologically and
in terms of artificial intelligence requires the comparison
with other games.  It does not require (and in that I will
agree) endless arguments about sportsmanship in a checkers 
event, but nothing requires that.
