I keep seeing the term "generalization of Hex" bandied about to
describe variants of Hex and families of variants of Hex.  Most
recently in Board Game News:

There is only one generalization of Hex: Atoll.  Atoll is a precisely
defined, infinite set of games all of whose members share the central,
defining, geometric principals of Hex: The goal is to connect opposite
segments, and on a filled board you have exactly one winner.  In the
special case of Atoll in which the set member has the least allowable
number of perimeter segments, four, Atoll is exactly equivalent to
Hex.

Atoll is only one of many generalisations of Hex.  Atoll fixes the
shape of the board and the positions and sizes of the pre-filled
groups, but you can generalise even further.  My analysis found that
you can get the property of exactly one winner on a full board if the
following two criteria are fulfilled:

 1. If a group of tokens of one colour is a winning connection, then
    even if all the other hexes are filled by the other colour, this
    can not be a winning connection for that colour.

 2. If a group of tokens of one colour is a winning connection, then
    you can replace any part of this by a group of the opposite colour
    as long as this new group doesn't touch anything else of its
    colour (including precoloured pieces or borders), and the original
    group will still be a winning connection.

The first criterion guarantees that there can't be two winners, and
the second that a filled board will have a winner.

You can use this to make a toroid variant of Hex:

The board is a torus with a hexagonal tiling.  You can simulate this
by a rectangular or parallelogram board that wraps around both top
to bottom and left to right.  There are no edges on this board.

In order to win, Black must make a closed loop that encircles the rim
of the torus and White must make a closed loop that encircles the
center of the torus.

Criteria 1 is clearly fulfilled, as a loop around the rim and a loop
around the center must cross, so both can't exist at the same time.
Criteria 2 is fulfilled because replacing part of a loop by the other
colour can't make it into a non-loop unless the new pieces touch old
pieces of their own colour.

On a rectangular or parallelogram board with wrap, this means that
Black must make a loop that crosses the top/bottom wrap an odd number
of times and the left/right wrap and even number of times (including
0) and White must make a loop that crosses the left/right wrap an odd
number of times and the top/bottom wrap an even number of times
(including 0).

This is a generalisation of Hex, as if you precolour the top/bottom
wrap black and the left/right wrap white, you get Hex.

We can call this toroidal Hex variant "Torex".
