This is a game for two players.

Start by drawing an n-by-n grid on paper. (I don't suggest that n be
too big, unless you are playing this game on a computer.)

The players take turn filling in squares, each player filling in one
empty square per move.
Each player fills in floor(n^2/4) squares total.
(So, 2*floor(n^2/4) squares are filled in all together at the game's
completion.)


Now, interpret the filled-in (black) squares and the blank (white)
squares in each row and column as the digits of a binary number. In
any particular row or column, either all the black squares represent a
0 or all of the black squares represent 1. And the white squares each
equal the opposite binary digit than the black squares represent in
that row/column. And the binary number can be read either top to
bottom, or bottom to top (for each column), or left to right, or right
to left (for each row).

So, to be clear, the binary digit (0 or 1) represented by a color has
to remain the same within any particular row or column, but can differ
between different rows and columns.

And the direction the binary number is read can differ between
different rows and columns.

So, after the game is complete, the players go through and write down
in two lists, one for the columns and one for the rows, the decimal
representation of the largest possible PRIME possible, if any is
possible, for each row and each column.

Player 1 gets as a score the product of all of the primes in the
columns.
Player 2 gets as a score the product of all of the primes in the rows.

The player with the largest score wins.

Example (randomly "played" with no strategy):
n=6:

. * * . . *
* * . . . *
. * * * . .
. * * . . .
* . * * * .
. * . . * *

Largest primes, or 1 if all possibilities are composite or 1:

For columns:
1, 61, 29, 53, 3, 1.
Score =
61*29*53*3 = 281271.

For rows:
1, 1, 1, 1, 29, 19.
29*19 = 551.

Player 1 (columns) wins, obviously.

Leroy Quet

My example-game grid is confusing on rec.puzzles, because they use
proportional font there in Google Groups.

So, here is the grid again, with periods replaced with o's.

o * * o o *
* * o o o *
o * * * o o
o * * o o o
* o * * * o
o * o o * *
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course, this can be confusing too, since the o's do not necessarily
corollate with 0's.
