        Why not change the way the point is divided between Black and White
for draws? White has a certain advantage over Black in chess just by virtue
of going first. Therefore, it is slightly more difficult for Black to get a
draw than for White. If the result of a draw were to award White 1/3 point
and Black 2/3 point (or something similar that favors Black slightly), we
would see more decisive results and have White more motivated to play for a
win. This may be less painful to many than tinkering with the standard chess
rules.
        Go doesn't have draws AFAIK, because the standard komi (handicap) is
something like 4 1/2 stones. A desperate player might surreptitiously break
a stone in half, but I doubt that tournament directors would go for it.
        It is difficult to draw in Shogi because no piece is permanently out
of play, so the position eventually yields to one side or the other. Perhaps
we should substitute Chessgi for chess? Chessgi is chess with drops.
        In Triplets Chess, each player has to move K, a pawn, and other
piece on each turn, with special rules for the first three moves of the game.
This game never ends in a draw -- eventually somebody will run out of pawn
moves. Three cheers for Triplets, the draw-less chess!
