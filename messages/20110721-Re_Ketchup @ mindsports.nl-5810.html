 &gt; Ketchup strategy is very interesting indeed.

Thanks!

I'm pretty sure it will outgrow hh5.

My jury's still out. Reason: experienced players stay more
disconnected for longer, stretching out the opening phase. Small
boards counter the issue.

Ed made sure to get two large groups and keep the option
to connect them.

Yeap! One of the first strategies that player uncover.

It's a remarkable coincidence that we both came up with territorial
games involving groups, and both with a new move protocol. Must have
been in the air ;-)

As I recall a bunch of people were trying to design territorial games
around that time. In the air it was.

I tried to adopt your move protocol to what is now Ketchup's win
condition. But I regard the attempt as a failure. The games you
invented with your protocol are far better.  Your move protocol also
inspired another game called Morro, which I don't think I've posted
here, but which nonetheless turns out to be pretty interesting on
smallish boards (say 7x7), or at least, pretty interesting for an n-in-
a-row game.  Rules here:

(the other game described in that post, Hedgerow turned out to be
terrible with the rules as written)
