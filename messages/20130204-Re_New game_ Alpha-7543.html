It's an interesting concept in itself.  If it's bizarrely determined that there must be a tacked on kludge to make a draw susceptible game decisive, then yes, CF pie may have potential.  Beyond CF pie's immediate kludginess, there's the task of remembering, after an hour of intense concentration, whether or not the pie rule was invoked.

CF pie depends on a sufficiently low draw rate to work.  If for example there's at least a 51% draw rate for a given board size and skill level, regardless of the initial move, then White will always invoke CF pie and have the advantage.

But given a sufficiently low draw rate, CF pie does have the potential to make the game fair.  With normal pie, Black should select the most equitable initial move.  I.e. the move with the smallest absolute value of an advantage.  Ideally the move will be so nearly equitable that it won't matter if the pie rule is invoked or not.

With CF pie, Black must assess the likelihood of a draw, and select a sufficiently advantageous initial move to precisely offset the disadvantage of having a draw converted to a loss.  Assuming such moves even exist, then, as with regular pie, it shouldn't really matter if CF pie is invoked or not.  One player will have the advantage of a good starting move balanced by the disadvantage of having a potential draw converted to a loss.

Personally I don't find non-cyclic draws so abhorrent that the game must be marinated in kludge sauce to avoid them.  But it's not my game.  It's Nick's.
