Well, now that this thread is completely derailed we may as well discuss Ayu!



One open question I have about it is: what's the relative value of connecting from the "outside in" vs "inside out"? Is one generally better than the other? If not, is the value of one vs. the other dependent on the specifics of each board position? I ask because I imagine that if there's a real tension between the two approaches, it could make the game exciting indeed. Having only played it a couple of times, however, I have no idea what the answer might be. Luis?

Connecting from the outside in is better because it helps better to the general goal of joining all your pieces. Every move contributes perforce to that goal, but every point you vacate can become a weakness in your position as well, and moving from the inside out helps minimize those holes. Other factors can change your priorities, though. When you're trying to line up your stones on the side to build up a strong wall and the opponent interferes, you'll probably need to bring reinforcements from the center, and creating a hole will then be inevitable.

Take this game, for instance:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mindsports.nl/cgi-bin/Arena/Serve.cgi?file=Ayu1358958530.html">http://www.mindsports.nl/cgi-bin/Arena/Serve.cgi?file=Ayu1358958530.html</a>

Note how my opponent forces me to constantly deflect my center pieces to keep my west wall going. Yes, I liked my wall. And, for a while, I thought my opponent was actually helping my cause by forcing me to do what I already wanted to do, but then it became clear that the same center moves of him that I took as mere threats to my wall were contributing to his own wall on the right, which, to make matters worse, was progressing unhindered by black stones thanks to the very center holes I had so happily created.

But even walls themselves can be a problem, and this is where things become tricky. The goal of the game is running out of moves before your opponent does,  which implies slowing down his progress as much as possible. You do so by interposing walls to increase the distances among his pieces, but if you completely fence them off, you're actually depriving them from any movement. If your opponent knows what he's doing, he'll try to channel your pieces into inconvenient positions so that you're unable to open a path for his enclosed units to start crawling in time, and you'll lose. This negative feedback on wall creation is the hardest factor to assess and will probably become the main source of strategic value among skilled players.

This game, which I'm probably about to lose, is a good example. Justin didn't put much resistance to my wall on the right, but his subsequent moves on the left are forcing me to incorporate the rest of my pieces to the extremes of the wall, where they block the floodgates, so I'll probably be unable to open them in time for his two east and sections to communicate. By getting aparently closer to winning, I got actually closer to losing.
