Nasty indeed! I tried to analyze a version with only two lines,
and any real number between 0 and one's score as a possible bid.
So what is B's probability of winning in the following position
assuming perfect play?

    |  |       Score
  A |  O B     A: 1
    |  |       B: x

Let's call it p(x).

Here are my findings after thinking about this for a few
days. It's not a lot, but I don't think I will get much 
further with this.

If players are allowed to bid 0, or everything they have
(or anything in between, of course), and a position where
both players have score 0 is declared a win for the player
whose side the box is closest to, then p(x) is well-defined 
for x = 1/2 and 1 with values 0 and 1 respectively. We then 
have

   p(x) = 1 - 1 / (2 - p(1/x - 1))

for 1/2 &lt;= x &lt;= 2/3, subject to p(1/x - 1) being well-
defined, which gives

   p(x) = 2 - 1/x

whenever x is the ratio between two consecutive positive
Fibonacci numbers (1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, ...), or the 
limit case (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

I don't have a proof that p(x) is well-defined for any
other x between 1/2 and 1, let alone a way to determine
its value, but it is not equal to 2 - 1/x in the whole 
interval, because player A has a strategy that ensures 
a win with probability &gt;= 2/5 for x = 3/4. So if p(3/4) 
exists, it lies in [p(2/3), 3/5] = [1/2, 3/5], while
2 - 1 / (3/4) = 2/3.
