Well, it seems that what you need is a method of easily representing two
different values on each piece, one ranging from 1 to 11, and the other
being in the set {1,2,3,5,8}.

First, each piece must be identified as having a side. Checkers pieces are
a good size, and come already color-coded for two sides, so I'll use one
of those as a starter.

Next, each piece has a rank. Write a rank on the top of the checkers
piece. When a piece changes rank, change the piece to one with an
appropriate number on the top. I forget how many pieces existed in the
game, but this means that you will need 5 * (number of pieces) different
pieces to cover all possible situations.

Finally, you need to indicate decay. Drill a hole in each piece, big enough
to fit a toothpick. Make a number of little flags out of toothpicks. Write
a letter from A to K on each flag. For starters, each piece has an A flag
put in it.

Make a row of boxes along one side of the board, lettered from A to K.
Put a marker in the A box to start with. At the end of every round, move
the marker one letter forwards. When it passes K, it wraps around to A.
If, after moving the marker, a piece has the same letter on it's flag as
the letter the marker now indicates, it has expired.

Whenever you move a piece, update it's flag to the letter the marker is
currently indicating.


I am certain that there is much room for improvement in this system, but
it should work.
