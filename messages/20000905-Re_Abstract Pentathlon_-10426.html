In my opinion, an abstract game should be one whose entire course can be
recorded (in any standard medium for recording simple information: pen
and paper, human memory, binary digits, etc.) and replayed perfectly.
"Abstract" surely means that its entire essence can be captured, with no
loss of information, in a mental/mathematical/formal representation.

If we were sufficiently confident that nature behaved exactly according
to our physical theories, and if we had sufficiently accurate measurement
devices to record the exact course of a football game, and if we had
sufficiently powerful technology to replay the football game exactly and
resume exactly where we left off, then I would call football an abstract
game.  But we're not at this point yet, if indeed we ever will be.
