(I apologize if the name "X-it" is already the name of a game
somewhere, which it must be. But a search for 'X-it game' on Google
didn't bring anything up in the first couple pages of results.)


This is a game for any plural number of players. Start with a grid of
n-by-n squares ((n+1)-by-(n+1) lines) drawn on paper, where n is even,
and where I suggest that n is &gt;= 12.

At the beginning of the game, a small x is drawn at the intersection
of the middle horizontal line and middle vertical line.
Players take turns moving. On the k-th move (the kth move considering
all the players' moves together)
the player "traverses" j(k) = (k-1)(mod(n-1))+2 intersections from
where the last player last put an x.
(So, for k = 1,2,3,4,...,n-1,n,n+1,n+2..., the number of intersections
traversed is 2,3,4,5,...,n,2,3,4,..., repeating 2 through n.)
(On the first move, the first player traverses 2 positions from the
central x.)

The player can "traverse" j(k) intersections in the direction of
either right, left, up, or down, and then may change direction at any
time at most once, and traverse perpendicularly to their initial
direction for the remainder of the j(k) intersections traversed. The
player then places an x at the intersection they land upon. It is only
acceptable for players to land upon (at the j(k)th intersection
traversed) an intersection without an x already drawn upon it. Players
may, though, traverse over intersections with x's already on them, or
not.

After a player writes down an x, he/she gets a point (points are bad
in this game) for every other x already written on the same vertical
line and same horizontal line as their x.

The game continues until any player cannot move anywhere (given j(k)
and the lack of available intersections).

The player with the SMALLEST score wins.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
