Well that depends on the game of course.  It may well be a game where
the setup although randomised doesn't heavily favour one player or the
other.  In that case I don't see that much of a problem to be honest.
Of course it would require a bit of analysis beforehand to work that
out.  But as with everything views differ.

There are ways, even with heavily unbalanced sides, to be able to make
things fair, the top way is having people play both sides.  For a game
with randomized openings, this would be a preferred approach also.

However I think we are straying from the point somewhat.

I think part of the problem of IAGO is that there is too little deep
thinking on what it actually wants to do.  From the website it seems
that tournaments, maybe a magazine and some woolly phrase about "promoting
abstract games".  It is trying to do too much at the initial phase IMO
its focus is spread too thin - both in activities and games.  What I
would do is have a core list of abstracts that will form the basis
of the tournaments and form an advisory committee to adjudicate on
whether any new games suggested would fit the tournament - this would
be not just on whether they think it is an abstract, but also on whether
it is too unbalanced, or it is too simple or too long for the tournament
format.

More thought is needed and a lot more work needs to be done.  What is
likely to happen now is that a current tournaments going on for modern
abstracts can be linked together under the IAGO banner to get the name
out and run a "tour" of these games throughout the year, with points
being awarded for how well you do.  At the end of the year, top points
leader is the champion for that year.  Future year, last year's
champion could defend his/her title.

There will need to be a standards committee also formed also to get
things to happen at this point to.
