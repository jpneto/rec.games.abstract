People say that linear algebra is different from other undergrad math
courses because it teaches abstract thinking. I don't notice much
difference. Linear algebra has variables and matrixes but so do other math
classes. Where is the abstract thinking part of linear algebra? Why do they
make you go through Calculus before taking linear algebra? And what's the
difference between linear and normal algebra?

Linear algebra might come closer, but most of the present
linear algebra courses do almost nothing to teach abstract
thinking.  Abstract algebra does a far better job, as does
good formal logic.  I see no point in having linear algebra
precede abstract algebra, except as a course of examples.

As for why calulus is assumed, there is the SUPPOSED
claim of mathematical maturity.  There is SOMETIMES a use
of calulus to produce examples (differentiable functions, 
and other such) of linear spaces.

In my opinion, it is the reverse; no amount of learning
computation can help more than very slightly to learn any
conceptual material, while conceptual understanding makes
the learning of conceptual material much easier.  Learning
facts and formulas does not help in understanding, but can
greatly interfere.
