You can find details on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gipf.com">http://www.gipf.com</a>.

The general idea is, Gipf is an alignment-game, where the goal is to
make 4 in a row in certain ways to capture the opponent's pieces.
Then, there are potential pieces linked to each of the individual
games. (Sold separately in Gipf set 1 and 2, but Gipf set 1 is
currently out of print i think. You also get samples with some of the
games, certainly with Tamsk and Zertz, and I think with Dvonn too.)

These potential pieces work approximately as follows. You can ask to
make a special move with one of the "potentials" [on the Gipf board].
The opponent can then either accept the move, or challenge you to the
corresponding game. If you win the challenge, i.e. by winning say a
game of Yinsh, you make the move, and if you lose the challenge, the
piece goes out of the game.

This means that the games are not tied very closely together, and any
game could be replaced as "challenge game". But, the powers of the
potential pieces are closely linked to the mechanics of the individual
games. Certainly a very interesting concept, but it seems it takes a
certain skill in all the games before combining the games becomes
interesting.

I have DVONN and YINSH and I was wondering about how games in this series 
are combined. Since "GIPF" is referred to as the "Central" game in the 
series, do you need to have it to combine games? And if you have GIPF along 
with, say, DVONN or YINSH do you need to buy anything else to combine them?

Also, I notice the claim that YINSH is actually the 6th game in the series, 
and the 5th will be coming out last. Does it actually matter what "order" 
the games are in? If so, why?

Sorry if these are FAQs for this group.
