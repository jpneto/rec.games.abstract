Undoubtly Mr. Schaeffer will beg to differ with your post and I will second
his opinion (before he even makes it!  :)

How good are computer checkers players? Has the game of checkers been

The checkers program Chinook recently played a match for the human
World Checkers Championship, narrowly losing to the champion, Dr.
Marion Tinsley.  The program is clearly in the top 5 in the world,
and an arguement can be made that only Tinsley is better.

Checkers is not solved.  There are 5*10**20 positions.  However,
there is a good chance that the game will be solved in the next
few years.

Chinook didn't lose narrowly: it was whipped pretty thoroughly.
(Though I do agree that Tinsley is the only one who can do it)

What is your basis for saying this?  Chinook lost 2-4 with 30 some odd draws.
One game was a machine crash and another was a desperate programming attempt
to make Chinook more agressive to try and even the score.

As for checkers being solved in the next few years, I doubt it.  The
game is likely to be taken beyond the human scope (Chinook II may be
able to beat even Tinsley, who is far and away the best human
checkerer), but I doubt that will result is a first-player-win algorithm
any time soon (maybe within 10 years as data storage gets better, but
not before then).

The game is big but Chinook is making big strides in sizing it up.  Chinook
uses a huge endgame database and on fast enough hardware searches an everage
depth or 21 or so.  This enables the program to announce the outcome of some
games after only about 15 moves of play or so.  Right now, I believe Schaeffer
and crew are working on increasing the size of the endgame database which will
aloow for earlier "outcome determinations".  The claim simply is that event-
ually they'll push it all the way back to move 1.  True that's quite a leap,
but I think its possible.
