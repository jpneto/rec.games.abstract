This sounds remarkably like a game I used to own called Conspiracy.
You had four 2-4 players and a rather small number of spaces you played on.
Probably minimum of 5 or 6 moves from one city to the other.

There were 10 agents on the board, and one secret file that started in the 
middle.  I believe each person started out with about 10,000 bucks and had to
bid a certain price on any of the agents.  Once bid you couldn't take any money
away.  The rules were fairly simple.  Each turns, people first put money on 
agents, then they each got to move one agent.  IF an agent was on the same
square as the file, then he could move with it.  At any time a player could
stop another from moving, IF he had more money on the agent.  

This is were bluffing and such got into it.  You wouldn't want to reveal too 
much about how much money you ahd where.  I'm forgetting a few other rules.
I distinctly remember the ability to "kill" or put out of action a agent.
But its been a while.  I believe Conspiracy was but out by Milton Bradley,
and no doubt based on Dr. Solomon's Sigma File.

A similar game is "Mythology" (I forget who put it out -- Avalon Hill?), in
which players take the role of deities.  The players allocate points to
particular heroes on the board (the points represent divine influence) and,
in their turn, have the opportunity to control a hero's actions.  If more
than one deity desires control, then they have a bidding war (the maximum bid for
each deity is the # of points they have allocated).  The winner gets to
control the hero's action for that turn.  Each turn, the deities get more points
for divine influence, so the knowledge one gains from the bidding wars helps
in allocation strategy, etc.

I got the game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>years<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ago (1984?) and liked the concept (progressive point
allocation, so you're rarely <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> sure of the scope of your influence), but 
never got to play it &lt;sob&gt;.
