lol Christian I think you might have missed the point of this thread.
Besides which, I really don't think Mark is going to budge on this
whole Symple thing...

"The whole Symple thing", yes I can see that it may have passed you
by. Well then, there's Zickzack, in your self-contained unit. This is
his last post in a thread he started at BGG, a thread I removed my
contributions from:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5678716#5678716">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5678716#5678716</a>

Here's a quote:
"At what move should White grow in order to prevent Black from doing
so? At move 1, it is not possible. At move 2, it gives a one double
stone group facing an opponent with a single stone group and the right
to move. In the discussion of the three move swap protocol, I have
argued that this is lost. Likewise, will Black wait until White can
pull a growth on him or will Black secure the extra points and the
increased options of the groups grown due to the balancing rule?

Symple is a double Chicken now. The first is when to grow first for
the sake of either using or, well, disabling the balancing rule, and
the second is inherent in the game mechanism itself - when do you have
generally enough groups to grow from?

In any case, we can infer that the balancing rule succeeds at
balancing the game. And the result is an extra twist. Since the extra
rule "empowers" judgment respectively skill in the growth phase - that
is where the result of the first chicken game will show -, I argue it
gives an even better game."

So at least someone in your self-contained unit found it worthy of
consideration.

And about missing the point of this thread?
Where, then, could a mechanism as "the whole symple thing" be
discussed seriously?
Where would it be noticed at all, with all these agendas flying
around?

I think those that are <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> discussing game related topics are
missing the point.
Or am I missing the point?

Christian all I'm saying is I don't have anything to say about Symple
on rec.bile.insult. I definitely found Symple intriguing, I'll leave
it at that. ;)
