# I've been playing a solitare game called "Seahaven Towers" on my Mac.

# physically, so playing it on a computer really helps). It's a lot of
# fun, and actually rather ADDICTIVE...
# 
# Quick rules: 52 cards, standard deck. Deal 10 columns of 5 cards each,
# all FACING UP so you can see every card. Put the other two cards on two
# of the special "docking" piles at the top. The object is to get all the
# cards in four "finished" piles-- one for every suit, ace first. 
# 
# However, you can only move cards 3 ways (all ONE AT A TIME, only from
# the buttom of a column)
# 	a. to one of the docking piles (anytime you want)
# 	b. to one of the finished piles (only if it is the next one in
# 		series.)
# 	c. to the bottom of another column, but only if you put it on 
# 		top of the next higher card in its suit. 
# 
# (if you are confused, let me know. It's something that is hard to
# explain without actually seeing someone play)

The version of this game that I play (with a real pack of cards) is
rather harder because the initial state is as 8 columns, with 7 cards in
the 1st 4 columns and 6 in the last 4. Apart from that the details are
the same as in your version. The four "docking piles" start empty, and
can only hold one card each, so once those are full you are probably in
trouble.

An additional rule is that you can move any card to an empty column if one is 
available. Note that in this game, cards can only ever be moved one at
a time.

I think this game is described in one of Martin Gardner's recreational
mathematics books. I find I can win it about 1/3 of the time, but I
suspect that closer to a half of games are winning.
