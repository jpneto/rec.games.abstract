This is a game for any plural number of players.

First, draw a (2n)-by-(2n) array of dots (where the dots correspond to
the vertices of a grid of (2n-1)-by-(2n-1) squares), where 2n is at
least 6, I suggest.

Players take turns drawing a rectangle each move, each rectangle using 4
of the dots as corners. Each rectangle must have a unique area and have
unique corners (see below).

The sides of the rectangles may overlap those of previously drawn
rectangles, but no corner should be the corner of a previously drawn
rectangle (drawn by any player).  After drawing a rectangle, mark the 
4 dots which are its corners with x's [...]
Also, after drawing a rectangle, write down in a (growing) list 
the area of this triangle [...]   No rectangle may have the same 
area as any previously drawn rectangle [...]  The last player able 
to successfully draw a rectangle using 4 previously-unused corners 
and having a unique [and non-zero] area is the winner. [...]

I think the following variant would be more fun:  The first player
marks a "challenge point".  Thereafter, each player completes a 
rectangle that uses the current challenge point as a corner, 
and then marks a new challenge point.  If a player fails to meet
a challenge (due to an area conflict, a lack of open points, or
carelessness) then that player is out. 

Also, rather than a (2n)-by-(2n) array, perhaps the size should 
be (2mn)-by-(2mn) if there are m players, to guarantee (at least
theoretically) an equal number of dots per player.
