OK, my computer crashed without me saving the first 4 pages of my 5
page paper on the pie rule, so i'll just respond directly this time.

First off, if anyone is one of those pie rule can do no evil it is the
holy grail that takes any game and turns it into gold, do not read
what i'm about to say.  There is no point, you will just continue to
believe as you will and have nothing rational to contribute to the
arguement.

On the pie rule in general:
Now that I got that out of the way, the pie rule can not ruin a good
game.  For a game to be good, it has to be robust enough to survive a
minor change such as adding the pie rule.  I stated the pie rule is a
disaster in Monkey Queen, because the costs to the game far outweigh
the benefits, as it could for so many other games.  One way it does
this is by blocking the depth of exploration for 1st player by tying
them to one strategy from the get go.  How good pie rule is depends on
the following:  How big of an advantage does 1st player have, what
results are possible, do offense and defense exist seperately, what
moves are options for 1st move, is there such a thing as a bad move (a
move that is weaker than no move at all), and what are the
alternatives.
Example 1:  Pie rule in hex
1.  Without pie rule, red has a large (~66%+) advantage, with pie
rule, red has virtually equal chances (~49.5%+)
2.  Draws are not possible, and offensive and defensive play is
synonymous (building an inevitable win prevents the opponent from
doing the same.
3.  Without pie rule, one move (center) is clearly the best, and no
other move is worth considering, with pie rule, red's most likely to
play one of 3 moves (a2, a3, b2)  that have the same practical value
to him (ladder excape), though others are considered that have a
different impact on play
4.  There is no such thing as a bad move, and even the worst moves
usually can be made useful as a ladder excape.
5.  The game offers one balancing alternative that naturally sprouts
from the rules:  different side lengths.  However, this is not
balanced (red's disadvantage is in the general area as his natural
advantage).
