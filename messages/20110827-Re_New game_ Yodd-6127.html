I have a habit of trying to get rid of move-restrictions, so I just
came up with the following possible modification:

There are no move restrictions. A player may create an even number of
groups with his move.
There's an off-board token, called a Gollum (why not?)
If there is an even number of groups on board at the end of your turn,
you take ownership of the Gollum
If the board fills and there are an even number of groups, the player
with the Gollum loses. Otherwise the player with the fewest groups
loses.

A similar token could be used in Ketchup, too:

Whenever a player extends his largest group, he places the Gollum by
his side. At the end of the game, the player with the largest group
wins. If both players' largest groups are the same size, the player
with the Gollum loses. This is equivalent to awarding the win to the
player who had the largest group for the last time in the game.

The Gollum could also be placed on the same stone which extends the
largest group, so as to eliminate any off-board reference.

On the other hand, why not simply "first-passer wins ties"?
