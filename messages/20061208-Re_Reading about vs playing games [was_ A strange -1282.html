Well that clarifies things quite a bit.

That's an interesting viewpoint!  I think I've only heard one person
call chess obsolete, and he meant it has been superceded by computer
games (since they can be far more complex without becoming
unmanageable).

It's refreshing to hear someone opine that draughts is a better game.

That said, if I had to choose one of the two to take with me to a
desert island for the rest of my days, I would still choose Chess.  For
me it is a more stimulating game.  I call it obsolete because it really
is so understood.  For me, once I got in to the Intermediate scene, it
really did become like graduate school where I had to start to decide,
"Do I really care that much about whether it's best to move Ne4 as
opposed to Ne6?"  High-level chess is just not for everyone.

When it comes to games, the abstracts are the most admirable, so I keep
coming back to them.  But my temperament keeps me dreaming, reading,
and writing rather than practicing, and so I end up being a perpetual
novice.  I'm not at all happy about that.

Well if reading and writing are what you love, than go for it!

As for choosing a handful of games to sort of "dedicate yourself" to, I
certainly wouldn't restrict yourself to Chess and Checkers.  Both are
ancient games that have been studied to death.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, but not by me.  :)  An extreme case is Nine Men's Morris, which
has been "solved"--meaning someone managed to program a computer to
play a perfect game.  Now everybody knows how it comes out if both
sides are played optimally.  But unlike computers, people don't make
perfect moves all the time.  So, the outcome is still uncertain between
two human players, and the game can still be enjoyed.  And while
they're having fun playing, two human players (or even just one playing
against a computer) can also work on improving.

To me, that's what game playing is all about--fun and improvement.
Sometimes one has to take a back seat to the other, but both are
important.

(Chess is one of those
games about which more books have been published than almost any other
subject.)  The current method of study really is primarily memorizing
past games with some actual calculation in the mid-game.  I started
down that path years ago and it just took all the "fun" away for me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I can see how it would.  Me, I've never gotten nearly that far.  I've
been kind of a "Boswell" to the chess world--I know the names and
histories of some of the top players, the names of openings, and so
forth, and yet I practice so seldom that my rating has probably never
been much above 1000.  Much of the time I play what Dan Heisman calls
"hope chess"--just making moves that feel right and hoping my opponent
blunders more than I do.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is the important point that clarified it for me.  As a 1000 player
with your drive, I say go for it.  As you've said, there's lots of
literature, lots of fun and even exciting games to study, and lots of
clubs where you can find players at similar levels.  (I know you prefer
computers, but nothing quite beats face-2-face club play.)  The early
learning process in Chess is what I enjoyed most.  There's lots of
standard openings to learn (memorize but you really need to understand
them too), the endgame (though 100% "known" still need to be known by
you), and the middle game provides lots of opportunities to improve
your calculation and look-ahead skills.  There is still lots of "fun"
in it.  My bubble burst after I reached a certain plateau and realized
that to break the 2000 barrier I would have to begin dedicating more
and more time to activities that I determined were less and less fun.
That's when I discovered Bridge (but that's a different story).

What's discouraging is knowing that there are some five-year-olds who
could beat me at chess.  And that I'm not much better at chess now than
I was back in high school.  Considering all the attention I've put on
the game over the years, you'd think I could at least play a decent
game.  But "attention" doesn't count; only disciplined practice does.

Ahh, but thus is life.  (He says looking at the 19-year-old grad
student that has spend 12+ of those years honing his instrumental
skills and reading nothing but musicology books.)  We're not all
machines, which in the end is a good thing =)

Draughts is better, but still a very "understood" game IMO.

Understood to the point where the best computer programs are at least
on par with the best human players, and where three-move ballots have
been introduced into tournament play to ensure variety and reduce the
frequency of drawn games.

That said,
you will certainly be able to easily find opponents for these games.
That will certainly be a factor in your decision.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, yes and no.  In truth, I may never play a game of chess or
checkers against another human being.  I don't know anyone who's into
either game, and I'm not motivated to play online or join a club or
anything.  There are computer programs that play these games very well
and can be "dumbed down" to my skill level, and I'm perfectly content
to just play against the computer.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You may well find that club-play may be essential in making some real
improvements.  I'm not a Chess pedagogue, but human players do not make
the same mistakes that a dumbed-down AI does.  Players of similar
levels make errors you can usually understand.  You can learn a great
deal from fellow players.  That step alone could well be what it would
take to raise your rating a few hundred points.  (There are lots of
online clubs but I have avoided them in the past because lots of the
players use computers to play their games and I just want to play with
a real person.  Face-2-face is much more socially satisfying anyway.)

Whether you choose Chess or Checkers, you are in for some study and
practice.  Either game I think will provide you with the challenge
you're looking for.  Despite my opinion that Checkers is "the better
game" (by which I mean just what you said, cleaner and more elegant) I
still get the most enjoyment out of a nice game of Chess.  Best of luck
to you!

P.S.  My favourite game of all time though?  That I could play for days
and days straight?  Bridge.  Yes you need 4 players, but for me it is
the optimal combination of social interaction and stimulating depth of
play.  You could spend a lifetime mastering this one too.
