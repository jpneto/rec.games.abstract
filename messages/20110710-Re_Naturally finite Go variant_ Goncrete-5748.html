This seems like maybe an over-strong criterion by which to judge this
effort, if only because I can't imagine any circumstance under which
Go players would ever deem any game better than Go, even if you
created a game that was in some sense actually superior.  Experienced,
dedicated players are both emotionally wedded to their game and can
"see" into it more deeply than they can other games, so they'll always
think it best. The effect is really obvious among chess players since
a few profoundly good variants actually exist, but most chess players
would never admit that they rival FIDE chess for quality.

About whether the life-making rule is natural: because it's so
straightforward, it seems like a rule that has a chance of feeling
natural with a little experience.  Abstract games-makers often don't
like rules that "wear their intent on their sleeves", but I think that
this kind of obviousness can sometimes be a good thing.  Don't know
whether it is in the this case, but it could be.

Not to mention, Go players are the biggest zealots of any players i
have ever met.  They are completely uncompromising on any aspect of
their game, or how it is played.  They have established their own set
of ideals on how the game should be played and anyone differing from
these ideals is wrong.  If a player wins because he was better
tactically, well it is his problem you lost.  If you over play your
ability in a complicated grab for a large potential territory and
lose, well you still win in your own mind because that is how the game
should be played.  Practically 90% of that community is more concerned
with winning a political battle after the match than winning the
match.  And if you dare change anything about their game, especially
translating any term into its english equivilent (example:  saying the
word initiative), prepair to be chased out for not saying sente!

Basically, if you are trying to make a variant go players will like,
give up now, something about the game draws in nothing but pricks.
