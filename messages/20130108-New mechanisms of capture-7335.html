How many new capture mechanisms can you invent?

Here is the game :
- Board empty (or no board at all)
- On his turn player drop a piece (stone or tile or token and so on), move or capture
- The game ends : when the board is full or when player run out of pieces (stones, tokens, tiles ....) or when some condition is fullfilled (no legal move and so on) 
- Then to define the winner (or the looser) either we count (scoring system) either we see who fullfill the goal of (connection, reach some pattern, and so on)

In fact 1000 of games are working using the pattern above.

If you invent 100 new capture mechanism you will create 100 new games.

The so called game designers are swimming on the same rotten lake.
No one is trying to get out of this pattern.
Look at games of Markrappy...for example.
Not one is original!!!
Someone has to make a big revolution.
New area of game (or no defined area at all) 
New components (or no material components at all) 
New mechanisms (or no predefined mechanism at all)
New goals (no winner no looser just achievement : player did progress or not for example)   
Even no predefined game at all. Some sort of MetaGame where we build progressively a game.

Good bye! 
I will travel soon.
