Well, yeah.  Now that the contest has actually entered the judging phase,
and all of the games have been explicitly cleared as admissible by the
contest organizer and all the contestants, I'd say it's a little late to
bring up a discussion of which games are really qualified to be in the
contest, yet the fuck again.

oops that was that you issued a protest to anyone on the judging panel
who has ever opened discussion on what was and was not within the
rules.

Also, you arn't the director or moderator, and just a couple of days
ago people were saying a 3rd judge would be nice, so why are you
declairing my application dead, not even open for discussion?

Furthermore, i did read all the dicussion, it was never stated whether
theme relevance is a judgeable choice or not.- Hide quoted text -

ok, in the other topic i was told that relevance will not be any part
of the scoring, niether as a slider nor as a binary relevance test,
though i propose next contest does at least add a binary relevance
test to the game.  If i was made a judge, i would respect the wishes
of the committee and judge a game purely on it's gameplay, not on
anything else.  Also it has only been 3 days since people last stated
they wanted a 3rd judge, i am immediately avaiable without even having
to learn the rules, and with already having played each game, and thus
would quickly be able to play.

I ask Daniel to rule on my application, and for anyone else to chime
in as well
