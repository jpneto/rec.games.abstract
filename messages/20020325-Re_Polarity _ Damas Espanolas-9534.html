Dear Chris,

I appreciate the discussion with you! Where do you live? In the USA or in
some other country? I live in the state of Germany of the European
Union (i.e. the slowly emerging "United States of Europe"). You are among
the most creative artists who design games. I love Tourney and Gorgon.

Thank you. To answer your question, I'm an American.

I appreciate the feedback.  It seems the obvious solution is to invert the
Lower Side's set-up so it has the same grouping of negative pieces as the

Side.  This would help balance the game and force the use of more positive
pieces.

This should be tried out! Giving Black a positional  advantage in the
beginning in return to White's advantage of having the first move is an
elegant philosophy. It's reminiscent of Renju, where the rules were made
unfair to make the game fair.

There seems to be two choices as how one can handle this.  First, one can
essentially reverse the board, giving the Lower Side four groups of negative
pieces and the Upper Side two groups of negative pieces.  This would give the
second player a more advantageous set-up than the first player.  The question
is the first player advantage that significant that it warrants giving the
second player such a strong edge?

Second, one could give the Lower and Upper Sides the same set-up of four groups
of negative pieces.  This change would balance both sides and would force the
use of more positive pieces, which is more in the spirit of the game.  The
question now is the first-player advantage still too strong?
