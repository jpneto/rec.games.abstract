What is known about the following game?  There are n non-cooperating players
(where the value of n is fixed and is public knowledge), each of whom secretly
selects a positive integer.  All the numbers are then revealed, and the winner
is the player with the smallest number not chosen by any other player (if such
a player exists; otherwise there is no winner).

I saw this contest in a magazine a long time ago. I beleive the

20 and 50.

When played anonymously like that, a player could 'spoil' all small numbers
by sending in bogus entries.  E.g. if he chooses 7 as his real entry, he
sends in, under psuedonyms, two 1s, two 2s, ... , two 6s.  If everyone
entering knows this strategy, it would just become a matter of who has
enough time to fill out the most entries.

So just changing the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>how<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> people participate in the game changes the game
itself.
