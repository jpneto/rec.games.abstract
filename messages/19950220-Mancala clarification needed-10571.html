I received a beautiful Mancala board for Christmas, and the family has 
enjoyed playing it. However, we've run into an ambiguity in the rules 
that were provided with the game, and checking three or four other 
sources doesn't clear it up. Maybe a Mancala player out there can give us 
some help...?

All the rules agree that when you sow your last stone into an empty hole,
you capture all of the stones on the opposite side of the board along with
your own. However, they don't address the situation when there are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>no<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
stones in the hole on the other side of the board. Is this considered a 
capture of zero pieces, in which case you'd remove your own stone, or is 
it not considered a capture since there are no pieces there, and your own 
stone is left in place?

I understand that there are about a bazillion variations on the Mancala 
theme floating around, but I'm curious as to how most people play. Thanks 
for any help anyone can offer.
