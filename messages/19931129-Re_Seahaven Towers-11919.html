Are you sure it checks the position?  A friend of mine wrote an (admittedly
simple) program to check a position for solubility using a backtracking
algorithm.  Possibly it wasn't very good, but I've had it try to evaluate
over 58 million possible positions before someone killed it or the machine
crashed.  This took many many hours.  If he and I missed a simple method
of deciding it's solubility, we'd both like to know.  Can you describe
what it's doing?

Yep, you definitely missed some very important simplifying assumptions.

Obviously, by the count of how many positions you considered, you were
counting each movement of a single card as generating a new position.  A
vastly superior way to look at the game is to consider only the movement
of "chunks" of consecutively-numbered cards.  When the tableau is
initially dealt out there may be up to five chunks per stack (or seven
chunks per stack if you are playing the 8-stack variation) and two more
pseudo-chunks in the hold spots.  However, since there is no provision
for adding an arbitrary card to a stack, the number of chunks in a stack
will never increase over the course of the game.  This is effectively
the same reasoning by which it is shown that it never hurts to put cards
on their aces whenever possible.

 From now on, the program should only consider "moves" which cause an
entire chunk to be put into a new position.  This reduces your overly
humongous move tree down to only the interesting branch nodes.  The
three types of moves remaining are: (a) movement of a chunk onto the
next higher consecutive chunk on the tableau (provided at least
chunksize-1 spots are open in the hold area), (b) movement of a chunk
headed by a King onto an empty stack (provided at least chunksize-1
spots are open in the hold area), and (c) movement of an entire chunk
into the hold spots (provided there are at least chunksize open spots
AND that it is not possible to move this chunk directly to the next
higher chunk).

Before and/or after each of these moves, the program should also
simplify the position as much as possible by moving cards to aces (of
course), and by moving cards down from the hold spots into the tableau.
These simplifications should <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be considered moves in the move
tree--they are simply natural results of having made the previous "move"
of a chunk.  That cleaning out the hold area can never hurt is shown
simply by noting that leaving them in the hold area only obstructs the
movement of other chunks, and what assistance it does lend to the
movement of the chunk it belongs to is already considered by the simple
"chunksize-1 free" check in part (a) above.

Using all of these simplifications greatly reduces the size of the
"move" tree and the time necessary to construct it.  The shortest
possible solution (in terms of number of chunks moved, not number of
cards moved, although I have not seen a situation where they differ) can
be generated on a Unix workstation, with a C program of about 5 pages,
in less than a second.
