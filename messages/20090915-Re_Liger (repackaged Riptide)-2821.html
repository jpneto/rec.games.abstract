I have seen a liger in a zoo (Novosibirsk Zoo, in 2006).  He was not yet
fully grown, though, so he was "only" the size of an average adult
female lion.  I was back at the same zoo this year, but the liger was,
unfortunately, not in its cage, so I could not see him fully grown. :-(

I almost felt sorry for the one I saw since it was freakishly big,
like it might be straining under its own weight or something.  But
they said it was the result of hybrid vigor so maybe that means these
cats' recent ancestors were also huge and the liger is quite naturally
proportioned.  This thing's back was higher off the ground than a
donkey's.  I think they said it weighed a half ton.
