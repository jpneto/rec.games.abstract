<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Some mechanisms in new games appear contrived to me.&nbsp; I can't think of
<br>an example here and now, but at least one of Sid Sackson's games struck
<br>me this way.
<br></blockquote></blockquote>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Contrivance is a good thing.&nbsp; No abstract game, including Checkers,
<br>would exist without it.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Maybe "too contrived" would have been a better phrase, less apt to 
misinterpretation.&nbsp; Or even "too abstract" (!).&nbsp; If a game can't have 
simple mechanisms for one reason or another, I at least like to see some 
"metaphor or sytlistic representation", as Patrick put it.
<br>
<br>Being able to move a piece by a distance equal to the number of pieces 
on its row, column or diagonal is the sort of mechanism that turns me 
off.&nbsp; Some people love this sort of game.&nbsp; Where my sentiments differ 
from those in your own earlier post, is that I relish the fact that 
while some designers experiement with novel mechanisms, others continue 
to find new ways to use the existing ones.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>The only game in Sid's book "Gamut of Games" that I found mildly
<br>interesting was Lines of Action, a game often attributed to Sid but
<br>which was actually invented by Claude Soucie.
<br></blockquote>
<br>This might be one of the games that turned me off, but it's that long 
since I've seen Sackson's book that I can't remember.
