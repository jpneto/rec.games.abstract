David,

Thanks for your suggestions, and to answer your questions, the event is listed
on the U-Con web site (though it's not my site at all). The number is BG-SA
15-10 on both the "board games" page and on the "Saturday" page, from 3pm until
7pm. U-Con runs a bit differently than some other gaming cons. For this event,
I will provide equipment for all the games for tournament play, including many
hand made by myself, others commercially purchased, but people who want to use
game clocks or timers are encouraged to bring their own. In each round, people
will draw randomly what game they will play from my own predetermined list. Two
copies of the rules for each game will be provided in case one or both players
doesn't know how to play. The structure, whether some sort of round or
elimination, will be determined by participation, as will the prizes offered.
And no, I don't expect many from far off to come visit, but there might be a
few from Michigan, Ohio or Ontario who are interested. Again, thanks for your
comments.

      Clark Rodeffer
