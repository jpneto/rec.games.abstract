Errr. Well-defined is a very technical term for me, and I would

Quite aside from etiquette and ethics, there are plenty of important
concepts in the rules of bridge that are purely subjective, such as
"logical alternative".

It's probably pointless to have a discussion of the rules of bridge
unless you have at least read them first.

Etiquette. The best bridge players I know are highly unethical. The
don't sort their hands, but they'll watch you sort yours.

Watching a player closely to observe how he sorts his cards, or where he
takes his cards from his hand, is explicitly prohibited.
