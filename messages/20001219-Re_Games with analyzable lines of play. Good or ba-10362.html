Chess is not fully analyzed yet, but it will be, some decades from
now. However, you're correct that chess has been analyzed a lot.

I think something slightly more complex than chess is optimal.

Part of the reason for this is that chess does not seem to be
geared towards the way that the human mind works. It's a game
more suited for a computer.

I prefer something more complex, which forces me to be more
intuitive because my conscious mind simply can't cope.

Of course I prefer roleplaying games to board games, and RPGs
are probably the most complex type of game possible.

But even there, there are subgames. Character creation, in
which I prefer that there is not one optimal strategy. Combat
tactics in which I prefer that there is not one routine that
maximizes your personal safety.

To take a concrete example, in the freeware RPG system Quest FRP
(there's a link to it from my website) your aptitude for each
skill is the (sometimes weighted) average of 2-3 attributes.
This system of interlinking is complex.

Depending on what kind of character you want to make, you
will want to maximize different attributes, and it's not
immediately obvious which ones or how much (example: for a
mage-type character, is Intellect more important than Will?).

You can analyze, you can analyze completely if you want to,
but I think few people does it, because 1) it's too much work
and 2) you don't get very much benefit from it (at most you
save 5-10% of your "points"). So the system mildly discourages
people from analyzing. It encourages you to go by intuition
(one player wants a smart mage-type character, another wants
a mage-type character with an iron-strong willpower - they
both turn out to be fine mages).

Despite this, it is possible to write a short text about
"Quest FRP character creation guidelines", containing hints
and tips on what to do and not to do.



But for me the optimum is 1-2 steps above what the conscious
mind can <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fully<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> analyze. But still very orderly, far from
chaos.

Back to chess, I like playing it against other humans, but
that's, to a large extend, because it's fun psychologically.
Trying to outguess my enemy. Beating him. Seeing him fail
to notice a trap I've set.

I'm not a very good player, and I'd dislike playing against
a real master player. And I hate playing against computers.

With a more complex game, that would be different.

I remember, last year, some of my friends were talking about
the war-card-game "Up Front". One of them was a hardcore
wargamer and had played UF for many years, but he had con-
vinced one of the others to come with him to a Danish
tournament. This other person had never played UF before
and yet he won the tournament.

That's flat out impossible in most (types of) games. But I
think it correlates with complexity. For instance you don't
really need significant experience to succeed at a RPG
(defining success as: your character fullfilling his or
her personal goals), if the GM weighs character skill
over player skill. You can go by intuition.
