This looks interesting, and thanks for making it available.  I have
been working on something that is roughly along the same lines.

You really need to add the ability to create AI players, I hope that
will come soon.

Are you trying to do something that is comparable to ZoG (Zillions of
Games)?

Hello,
my name is Jean and I write from Turin. I think that somebody here may
be interested in the program I'm developing as an hobby project.

My program provides a board for the following games:
- Wari
- Dao
- Entropy (by Carreno)
- Conway's Soldiers
- Tris (tic tac toe)
The program let the player make only the moves that follow the rules
of the game. It can play at random (without AI). The program can
manage new games by adding a script in the scripting language Lua.

If you think the idea is interesting, you can see more at:

For now my program runs only for Windows XP, but I plan to recompile
it for Linux.

It is still a beta release, so every comment, bug report, etc is very
wellcome.

Thank you for your attention!
Bye, Jean
