Hi Rich,
I am Luca, in Italy I and other players, keen of abstract game, have
made the Abstrakt project.
The aim of this project is the diffusion in Italy of the play culture

Sounds good.

What happens sales-wise with abstract strategy games is they generally
do poorly eventhough abstract games tend to have greater longevity.
When I say second-class citizens, I am saying there is a treatment of
people who play them as this.  In no way are they this.

A question, what is the meaning of "championship at Origins" ?
You want a world abstract strategy champion, which games  will be
played?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Origins is a convention in the U.S backed by GAMA.  The object is to
have a championship somewhere where they are other games played, so
you get media coverage.  I would have a range of abstract games, like
the World Series of Poker has a range of Poker games.  See below for
more details on what I refer to.  I am up for as many as possible.
Members could vote on what games they would have in.  I will repeat
below that multiple lesser popular games will need to be bundled
together with other games, in order to generate enough interest in
them.

I suggest you this sitehttp://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/where you can
play a lot abstract games.

Anyhow, here are some ideas I am kicking around:
Several other things I also would like to see come about:
1. Have one organization for all the players of abstract strategy
games that
don't have associations for them (this mean stuff besides checkers,
chess,
Go, etc...).  Eventually it would be good to get these other
organizations
involved, as an umbrella organization.
1a. Have there be a governing structure with officers to help direct
and
electing of these officers.
1b. Have a communication infrastructure in place, that would include
its own
website.
1c. Eventually work to have a paid dues for members so the
organization has
money to promote and operate, and also a prize pool also.  Having big
bucks
as prizes will draw media attention.
1d. To sum up, constitutional structure done.  Also, get some legal
help on
board.  The idea is to have this come off as a professional
organization,
complete with a professionally done website, that can end up leading
towards
every abstract strategy player joining.
2. Get a synchronizing of tournament calendars through the
organization, so
there can be a single tournament to resolve champions of abstract
strategy
games at a current event.  This could be Origins, card Grand Prix or
something else.  Have this single tournament with (same time, same
arena) as
many other type of non-abstract strategy games as possible, to drive
media
attention to abstracts).  This would act like an Olympics of a sort or
a
"World Series of Abstract Games" (similar to what they have for Poker
in
Vegas).
2a. The reason for as many other genres is so that there will end up
with
media attention.  For example, if you had the world poker champion
also going on at the same time and same place, that would draw
attention. Poker needs to
have its context changed and this is the way to do it.  The popularity
of
poker then causes people to work to draw attention to abstracts and
other
boardgames.  An interesting angle here would be to have the Chess
Boxing
Champion at the same event.
2b. Maybe even have the likes of puzzle solving tournament groups to
have
their tournaments there also.  Have the
2c. You could also definitely get AI research groups involved.
3. Work out a structure for ranking players.  Have it so there are
individuals champs, but also "Athlons" (triathalons, pentathalons,
decathalons) of multiple events.  I also would like an "Uberchamp" of
abstract strategy games in general.  I also would like a "Hardcore"
(inspired by ECW's Hardcore wrestling champ) category with a champ,
where a
player would be dumped into a match involving a game they didn't
prepare
for.   The idea of a diversity of games, is also essential to
cognitive
science research also, to see how humans learn and adapt to new
situations.
For cross-promotion, there could also be a champ who would play a
series of
games involving chess, go AND poker, for example.  Cross-polinate into
other
areas.

These are ideas.  It is time for abstract gamers to unite here, and
also other table gamers to unite also, so that an uberevent can come
about.
