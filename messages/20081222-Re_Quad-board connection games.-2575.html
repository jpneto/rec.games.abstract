Yes, I'm familiar with "evenly even" and "oddly even", (and BTW we
also
need similar simple English phrases to distinguish  4n+1  and  4n+3,
and also   3n+1  and  3n+2 !)

It was the "half-cell twist" I was puzzled about.

But perhaps you were just meaning that, on odd boards the "Free Y"
concept applies, and on evenly-even boards the Atoll concept applies.
That much is certainly true, and there is indeed no apparent solution
that preserves win/loss complementarity for oddly even boards.

A pity.

Yes, that is the unpleasant feature we have been trying to avoid.

A simple solution, OC, is to just mark out e-even stretches of border,
alternately coloured to each player, and then just play Atoll on that.
Alternately again, mark out an odd series of marked but unawarded
zones, and play Y on that.

In all cases, the over-riding simple joint goal, applicable to all
cases, is...

a)  join two opposite sides, or
b)  make a Y that prevents this.

In the Y-like games, (a) can be interpreted in a conforming way.

All well and good and unified.
