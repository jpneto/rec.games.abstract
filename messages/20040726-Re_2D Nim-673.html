You are perfectly right! Will try not to discriminate little-S in the

that an odd-omino can't be zero.

Sorry, I reversed a reasoning that can't be reversed! What I had in
mind is that when building up polyominos by adding squares, both
players will (attempt to) put down polyomino's with value zero.
However, starting from a zero polyomino, you can't create a new zero
polyomino by adding only one square. So one has to add at least two
squares to create a zero polyomino. Therefore, when restricting the
maximum number of squares to be added to two, only even zero
polyominos will be created (of course, one can then as well restrict
the addition rule further by stating that exactly two squares need to
be added). So, yes you are right- odd zero polyominos likely do exist,
but they can't be reached in the build-up phase.

Much more puzzling to analyse is the "misere" version, where the last move
loses.  For Nim itself this is easy, but for these more complex variants
it can be a real bastard! 
I don't think even CGB in WW got a complete theory for it.

Do you have "Winning Ways"? All four volumes? I read quite some
positive remarks about these books. They cost a little fortune with
Amazon.co.uk. Yet worth the buy?

BTW, if you like my nomenclature:-  Someone (not me) suggested that 
the poly-triangles should be called "polyiamonds", so that the 2-triangle
becomes the "diamond".  Not bad eh?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Isn't that the standard name (polyiamonds)? (Check
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.Mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyiamond.html">www.Mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyiamond.html</a> or try 'polyiamonds' in
Google.)

B.t.w. this reminds me of another variant of the game I briefly
considered:

An idea I played with is not only to restrict the moves in the
build-up phase to additions of one or two pieces, buth also to
restrict the moves in the elimination phase to the removal of one or
two pieces (and - of course - in case of the elimination of two
pieces, to restrict these to adjacent pieces). However, this rule can
perhaps be applied more naturally to polyiamonds rather than to
polyominos.

I haven't analysed this game in detail (niether for polyominos, nor
for polyiamonds), but I think it would make an interesting game in
both cases. What I like about this modified rule is that it improves
the symmetry between the build and removal phases, and that it better
stresses the character of the game: you start from 'nothing', go
through a lot of complications, and - finally - end with nothing (but
still have a winner and a loser ;).
