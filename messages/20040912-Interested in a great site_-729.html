Power Pets is a friendly virtual world, where you guide your character, your
pets and your minis around in New Barkston.

You can set many goals for yourself, depending on your likes and/or
dislikes. We try to create something for everyone. The main goal in the game
is to solve quest-style games to advance to next levels.

 From time to time, you might see Gekkie "sticky fingers" the gecko pop up,
or Nova.  They might grab some of your power bucks, give you some power
bucks or hand you an item.

Many features are made available, among which:
- Write your own story: This story, if accepted, becomes published into a
book, and can be purchased by other New Barkston inhabitants, who can read
and rate your book! For every book sold, you receive a commission.
- Open up to 3 shops: Sell items you have gathered, or show them off in a
gallery
- Swap items: Use our swap barn to exchange items with other players
- Adopt pets: You can adopt up to 4 pets.  Beware though, it is not an easy
task to take care of pets. Make sure you are capable of doing so before you
adopt more than one.
- Breed Minis: Minis are animals, deformed over time through experiments the
evil Padam has performed on them.  Find mini eggs and hatch them to help out
the Minis and give them a chance of a better life.
- Bureau of statistics: There are many ways to get into the Bureau and
become popular. It's up to you what you want to be known for!
- Training Arena: When your pet is ready, have them train their fighting
skills in our unique 4 player training arena - only on Power Pets!

We try to be as unique as possible on Power Pets. Here are some things that
set us aside from the rest:
- Friendly staff, online 24/7 to assist you should other players not be able
to do so.
- Challenging quests
- Thousands of items
- Site Helper Awards. Help out other players and receive awards
- Educational information, integrated into the game
- We care about real animals
- We listen to your suggestions. All suggestions are noted and reviewed, and
many are implemented to make the game the way you want it to be.
- Unique lifetime payout system for referrals.
- A story behind the game.  Check out the free books in the library to read
up on the History of New Barkston. We follow a game plot, and make sure
everything on the site makes sense.

There are many more features and parts to the game, but they would be hard
to explain here unless you have played Power Pets. Get started today and
join the fun!
