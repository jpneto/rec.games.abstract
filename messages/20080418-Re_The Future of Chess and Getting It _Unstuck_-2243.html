	Yes;  but not for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>every<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> mathematical system, only for
systems that include sufficiently powerful arithmetic.  I know
how to construct chess positions that depend on the truth of
[eg] 1 + 1 = 2, and an assortment of rather harder sums of
numbers-as-games [Noam Elkies has done some interesting work
in this area], but you will find it rather harder to construct
arbitrarily complicated arithmetic using only the finite set
of positions available in chess.  It is possible to encode an

is no more interesting than the fact that we can do the same
with sequences of letters -- the game itself, like the letters,
has no computational power of interest.

	Yes, but a Goedel sentence is not a statement <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>about<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> maths

	Goedel's theorem does not make any <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>particular<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> theorem

	Not, however, because of Goedel.  There are indeed much
more general results that make [eg] standard chess easier, inc
alpha-beta pruning, but also "theorems" about endings such as
KQvK, KPvK, and others.  [The techniques that we all learned as
beginners about how to win KQvK, KQvKP, and so on, all work just
as well on a 1000x1234 board as on an 8x8 board, as long as the
50-move rule is extended appropriately.  Other endings, such as
KQvKR and KBNvK don't generalise so easily.]

	Well, that's a little unkind.  There are regular contributors

professional mathematicians ....
