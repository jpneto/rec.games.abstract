Cant help you there buddy, but you will be happy to know that they are
coming out with a starflight 3. Cant wait till it comes out since I loved
the starflight series of the older AT computers in the early 90s.

A fan group with the permission of the original creators of the game.
They seem to be coming on quite well compaired to where they were when
I first heard of it. When I first saw it, I thought it was a cool idea
but nothing would come of it. I'm happy to say they have nearly proven
me wrong.

I'd be very interested in purchase of any copy of the old IBM
PC games by Electronic Arts "Starflight" and "Starflight 2"... I need
them in either 3.5 " disk or CD-ROM format, since I gave up my 5.25"
floppy drive some while ago.  Both need to be complete, and have the
appropriate documentation and "wheel" (you'll know what I mean) in
order to play due to copy protection...

Well, if you can lay your hands on any version of the game so you have
the legal licence you can download a copy of the IBM versions from the
web site referenced above. (It's in their downloads page...)

Later,
