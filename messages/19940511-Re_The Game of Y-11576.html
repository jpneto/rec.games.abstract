Briefly, the board is basically triangular, with bowed-out sides. Players
alternate placing a stone of their color on one of the 93 intersections on
the board, and the winner is the first to link all three edges of the
board with an unbroken line of stones of his or her color.

I've only had the game for a few days, so I can't yet agree with the Games
reviewer, who called it a game you'll never tire of playing. I've found it
strategically interesting, and the hardwood board, glass Go stones, and
cuordoroy carrying pouches [for both the board and the stones] are a nice
touch.

Just to follow up in a small number of ways: 

"Y", which I believe is the same game as "Poly Y", is basically Piet
Hein's classic game of Hex on a modified board. The Games reviewer (Wayne
Schmittberger) argues that "Y" is actually in some ways an improvement
over Hex because of the modification of the board. 

Most of the vertices of the board are six-pointed-- that is, each vertex
connects to six other vertices. However, three (symmetrically placed)
vertices near the center are five-pointed. This give the board its
characteristic "bowed" effect, and creates an interesting dynamic. In Hex,
and in most similar games, plays at the center of the board are
overwhelmingly more significant than plays at the edges. In "Y", this is
not as true, because of the "star points". These points connect to fewer
points than the others do, and this counterbalances their positional
importance.

I have not played "Y"; alignment games are not among my favorites.
However, Wayne Schmittberger is a big fan of them, and if he says Y is a
superior game, he's probably right.

It's also worth pointing out that Kadon Enterprises makes <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>first-class<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
games. Without exception, Kadon's games are very well-constructed, and are
usually beautiful to boot.
