White (o) to play and win decisively ...


The first three puzzle came from games I ended up winning.  I thought for
variety I should include a position from a game which I ended up losing.

This game was very interesting.  While white appears to have a huge
advantage in mobilty (black has only 5 moves, mostly suicidal), it turns
out that the position is very tight.  In fact, only one of white's moves
wins!  (I checked this out on a computer, to make sure the expected solution
is the "correct" one).  With correct play, white can force a win by at least
16 discs (40-24).

Can you find the move Francesco Marconi found in the actual game?

Have fun with it!

Colin
