While you're working on the 14 squares marked X:

   .........
   X.......X
   X.......X
   X.......X
   X...*...X
   X.......X
   X.......X

I'll work on the 9 squares marked Y:

Disrupting this is surely possible, but I suspect it isn't as
easy as you make it out to be.

Right - this is the key question: how easy is it to disrupt the above
counter-strategy?

I suggested it seemed quite easy, and you're saying it isn't.  Your only
example in your .PDF file is like the one Ed gave above, and it is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>so<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
trivial to disrupt this case that I wonder if you have seriously tried the
strategy?  The above example (and variations) was the first thing I tried to
test my strategy before I posted, and it seemed to me I could easily disrupt
such attempts.

We could settle by trying say 10 games of 9x9 against each other, and if my
edge strategy wins each one with little thought that would show something?
(I'm not convinced my strategy will win, as I've not played much, but I'm
not sure how much you've actually played either!  And if it turns out that
the game is indeed more complicated than I first thought, I'll be delighted.
:-)

Do you have a site where we could play online?  Or maybe 10 simultaneous
games in an email exchange or something would be workable...

Regards,
Mike.
