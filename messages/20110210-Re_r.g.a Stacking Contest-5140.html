Ok, fine.  Fuck Bill Taylor.  The fact remains that the public is a lot more

I'm not aware of any folk hero status and frankly you are the only one
who ever accused me of popularity. And an 'unfair advantage' on
grounds of personality isn't a very strong bid is it. I would not
object to a future contest with a public vote. You would. What's the
problem? No one is required to enter.

Yet you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>continue<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
to press for a public vote, albeit in future contests.  Again, fine.  Have a
public vote in a future contest that doesn't include my game.  Why don't we
stop worrying about future contests for the moment, and just see if we can
manage to get through this one?

Yes, that occured to me too.

I've never seen you so out of sorts, Christian.  You were really counting on
your star-struck public to pull you through here.  I'm tired of arguing
about this shit.  There will be a judgment and there will not be a public
vote.  Get over it or fuck off.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Do you often argue with imaginary people who disagree with you? I even
suggested two candidate judges, hesitantly because I'm afraid this
will already make them questionable in your view. I'm your view there
appears to be only one burning desire in my mind, winning this
contest. That's called 'projection'. I really don't care.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You know what you're doing right now, Christian?  Instead of just respecting
the will of the group, having a judgment instead of a public vote, and
moving on to the next topics like who the judges will be and what the
judgment criteria should be, you're creating a big stink.  Why?  So you can
withdraw your game and not subject it to its inevitable defeat against
Mixtour now that your supportive public has been ripped out from under you.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You're really losing it Mark.
a) Where did I not respect the will of the group? I didn't bring up
the public vote, that was Corey. I thought the vote would be public to
begin with. I never objected to any solution of a problem I didn't
create in the first place, I suggested candidate judges.
b) You seem to have the gift of prophecy all of the sudden,
congrats :)
3) The suggestion that I have a 'supportive public' is flattering, but
I got only your word for it. I think they're more likely supporting a
photoshopped image of christian freeling that you use to argue
against. Keeps you from reading what I actually post :)
