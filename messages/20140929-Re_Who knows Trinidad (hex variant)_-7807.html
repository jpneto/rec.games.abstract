That's your handicap, Christian.  You can't separate the design from the designer.  At weast one of youw handicaps, wow.  Wemembew "fowwow suit"? wow  I nevew met anyone with a typing impediment befow, wow

That is a sign of dishonesty.
When you can not separate the game from the designer you are not honest.
Christian Freeling is with no doubt not HONEST.
Starting from that truth we could state that he will not hesitate to copy-paste in sophisticated way others games.
To be designer is not having enough experience to balance games or to make existing games more addictive more interactive and so on. Anyone can do it. There are technics and tricks anyone could learn.

Creating new things require more than design experience.
So all the designers I studied their game (Cameron, Luigi, Mark Steere, Christian Freeling, and so on) are suffering from the same disease : they are too involved in dogmatic rules that they could not see other ways.
Recently a chinese mathematician surprised all the so called experts (the mandarinate) by discovering another path to prove the infinity of twin-primes.
Why I said that?
Sometimes you need to take time and have another sight on what is going on.
Maybe the innovation will come from someone who is out of the mandarinate. Someone who could think freely without any dogm.
Game design is not science. Game design is imagination first then comes the science or the technics.
