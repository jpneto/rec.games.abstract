You've heard of Fantasy Football, Fantasy Cricket, and Fantasy Grand Prix.
You may even have heard of Fantasy Baseball. Now you can play

    F A N T A S Y   D I P L O M A C Y

The league will work like this:

Each team can have upto 5 units at any one time.

Units will be awarded points based on:

	successful movements
	being part of a sucessful convoy (fleets only)
	successfully holding against an attack
	support of a successful attack against another piece
	successful support of another piece against attack
	successful capture of a supply centre
	successful disruption of a convoy (value of convoy)

Units will be deducted points based on:

	being overrun
	unsuccessful support of a piece holding against attack
	losing control of a supply centre
	being part of a disrupted convoy (fleets only)

Transfers, that is, changing the make-up of your team, will be
delayed by one move upon receipt of request for transfer. Your
team will maintain its make-up over the intervening move. Transfers may
be requested at anytime.

The league will be based on a standard game of diplomacy which I run.

To choose a team, please let me know which pieces you want in your team,
together with your team name. For example, Army in Paris, Fleet in Trieste, etc.
Pieces are currently in their standard starting positions. All pieces do not
have to be from the same country!

Moves take place every week, and the league will be adjusted accordingly.

Prizes!! The prize for coming top of the league at the end of the
game is ... well that's your part of the fantasy!

Full details (if I can think of anything else) will be sent with acknowlegement
of you team registration.

Please send any mail with "Fantasy Diplomacy" somewhere in the subject line.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.
