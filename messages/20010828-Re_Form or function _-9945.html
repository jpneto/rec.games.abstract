Aesthetics of the design are secondary, but the practicality of the "form"
is not. For example, cheap cardboard pieces do not easily stay in their
intended places but fly all around the board, and very often fancy
"artistic" design makes it more difficult to grasp the situation of the
game.

For an example of excellent "form" design, see the traditional design of
go playing equipment. On surface it may seem quite "Spartan" but there
are many hidden tricks to make the gameplay more convenient: The stones
are biconvex so that they are easier to remove from the board, the board
is made of thick wood (or at least ought to be) to produce a nice sound
when stones are placed on it, the grid is made of rectangles that are
not exactly square so that the seem to be square when looked from the
normal playing perspecive, in my foldable board the grid is not exactly
in the center so that the central fold does not cover the middle line of
the grid etc... It's this kind of features that add to the "optimal"
playing experience so that the player is not disrupted by the
shortcomings of the equipment but can fully concentrare on the gameplay.
