Another clarification: Each player's arcs must be drawn within the
interior of the circle from the circle's edge back to the circle's
edge.

I see that I was unclear.

Only one arc is drawn by a player on each move.

Thanks,

Here is a game for any plural number of players.

Needed: blank paper, pencil and compass (the circle-drawing kind),
maybe a protractor.


First, draw a circle on a piece of paper, relatively large.

Let m be a multiple of the number of players playing this game. m
should be &gt;= 8, at least, I suggest.

Draw m pencil-marks EVENLY SPACED along the circumference of the
circle. (This is why you might need a protractor, if you can't just
use the compass and straightedge to accomplish this by geometric
construction.)

There will be m moves in the game (or in the round).

Players alternately take turns drawing arcs with the compass. On a
move, a player uses the appropriate mark as the center of the circular
arc that passes through two other marks. The two marks (which the arc
intersects the main circle at) must be equidistant from the arc's
center mark, and that distant must be nonzero.
The first player starts at any mark to make the center of his arc; and
on each move after the first, the moving player uses for her arc's
center the mark immediately clockwise from the mark used for the
previous player's arc-center.

Count the number of preexisting arcs (not including the "arc" of the
main circle) that the moving player's arc intersects or touches. Each
player has a running-total of the number of arcs his/her arcs passed
through.

The winner has the FEWEST total number of earlier-drawn arcs (drawn by
any player) intersected or touched by their arcs.

Notes: An arc may touch/intersect other single arcs more than once
each, but each such incident only counts once towards the number of
arcs intersected or touched.

Also, multiple arcs touching at a point are counted as touching all
other arcs coming together at that point, no matter which arcs are
"behind" or "ahead of" which other arcs.

There seems to be an advantage for who moves first, and a disadvantage
for who moves last. So, maybe multiple rounds should be played, a
different round where each player is the first player to move. (Draw a
new circle with the same number of marks each round.) Then the total
scores for the rounds are added up for the grand score for each
player. Players try to minimize their grand scores, of course.

Leroy Quet
