Why thank you.  :)

But Tourney was always intended as a Checkers variant.  How it came about was
that it occured to me that European versions of Checkers all have diagonal
moves, and Turkish Checkers has orthogonal moves, but I had never seen a
Checkers variant with a Knight's move.  So I simply took the rules of
Anglo-American Checkers and substituted the Knight's move.  (Actually, the
Horse's move from Chinese Chess, to allow for blocking.)

Problem was, that in playtesting, what usually happened in the endgame was a
few pieces would endlessly chase each other around the board.  So I had to come
up with the "complete circuit" rule to help stabilize the game.

Tourney is a very interesting new game invented by Chris Huntoon. You can
find the rules at:

It is NOT a checkers variant as stated, but something rather unique and
new:

The main final goal is to reach your own start row with a "Charger" that
has been promoted to a "Champion" at the other end of the board. There are
also two other possible ways to win, but i think, in good play they will not
happen often. Huntoon's idea is quite new. You can win in Neutron by
moving a neutral piece to your own start row (first row as seen from the
respective player), but to win by moving your own promoted piece to it
appears to be unique. I will include the game in my encyclopedia, and will
even create a new subgroup in my goal-oriented classification system for
it.
