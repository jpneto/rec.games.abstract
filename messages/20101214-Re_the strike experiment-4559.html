I realized that I don't know jack about illustrator so a pdf of the
rules with nice little pictures will take a while.
In the meantime here's the version of the game which works very well
so far.

Setup:
Charisma is played on a 7x7x7 hex board.  Each player has a plentiful
amount of their own colored pieces.

Goal:
The player with the largest group wins.  If tied then another equal or
second largest group wins etc...

Turn:
Place one of your pieces on the board or strike with one already
placed.

Place:
....one stone anywhere on the board not adjacent to any other piece.

Strike:
....in a straight line a group of opposite colored stones which equals
the number of spaces moved + total number of own stones in the group
left behind.

End:
when one player can neither legally place a new piece nor move or if
its clear who will have the biggest group.

Thanks Christian, Mark, Corey and Declan for your input and feedback!
