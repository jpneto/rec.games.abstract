Out of curiosity and to get a better feel for the game, I analyzed some
small HEX-boards to see which initial moves are winning. Who knows, maybe
there's some pattern to be discovered?!

Well I haven't discovered it yet, but what I did discover is that even on very
small boards the variations can get very complicated.

The results for boards up to 4x4 seem to be as follows
(the first player, black, trying to connect from top to bottom, has winning
initial moves indicated `+' and losing moves as `-')

1x1:

+

2x2:

 + -
- +

3x3:

  + - -
 + + +
- - +

4x4:

   + - - -
  - + - -
 - - + -
- - - +

5x5:

beyond me.

Did anybody ever write a program that can handle the next few board sizes,
or, gasp, analyze it manually?
