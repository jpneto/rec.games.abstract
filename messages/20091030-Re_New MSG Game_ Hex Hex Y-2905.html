hours even on a small 11x11 board,

And that is supposed to be a good thing? It's wrong, anyway: IGC also
gives stats on average play time, and Oust has average play time of 50
minutes, vs. 30 for Kauri.

But I was thinking of the other games of yours. Now that you are
saying Oust beats the crap out of Kauri, then by the same reasoning,
Kauri must beat the crap out of Dipole, and your immortal Tanbo? Oust,
by the way, doesn't look like it will pass Kauri anytime soon in total
plays - it lost its novelty value. Of its 63 plays, only 3 were in the
last week
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.iggamecenter.com/stats/topplayed7.html">http://www.iggamecenter.com/stats/topplayed7.html</a>). Talk about a
steep fall!

But I'm sure that doesn't bother you at all - after all, you couldn't
care less whether anyone actually plays your games, right?
