<br>
<br>I appreciate your comments. I know I'm getting
<br>repetitious so I'll say nothing but
<br>to correct your mischaracterization of my position.
<br>
<br>I do not think any draws are "evil" nor do I think only
<br>12-move draws are bad. My position is that that
<br>the lack of decisivity in chess harms its fan appeal -
<br>the 12 move draw is only an extreme example of this.
<br>But the failure to fully contest chess games (because of
<br>scoring which makes agreeing to a draw a viable
<br>option) is an aberration in the sporting/gaming world,
<br>and does not make for good drama. If the players
<br>don't care enough to fully engage each other, then
<br>why would a potential fan care what they are doing?
<br>
<br>I have agreed to draws in what I thought were
<br>good positions but I was in major time trouble.
<br>I have accepted draws in positions that had lots
<br>of play left because doing so clinched a desirable
<br>place finish. I do not consider my behavior evil,
<br>and feel it was rational given the scoring.
<br>However, it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>was<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> fundamentally
<br>uncompetitive. It was letting non-chess factors
<br>(the scoring) intrude on the game itself.
<br>
<br>When top players make similar decisions
<br>to draw (as they do all the time, there
<br>is nothing aberrant about it) they are not evil, they
<br>are acting rationally, but they are also avoiding
<br>competition, letting the game on the board be
<br>corrupted by a defective scoring system.
<br>

<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>I find it baffling that you are so absolutely
<br>confident that grandmaster chess players would not
<br>be able to adapt their chess to thrive in a world that
<br>was less draw-friendly.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I find it even more baffling that you think that is what I
<br>think.&nbsp; GMs <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>already<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> adapt to draw-unfriendly situations.&nbsp; If you
<br>are [or your team is] behind in a match, then you are under pressure
<br>to win, and every draw is a nail in your coffin.&nbsp; Similarly, if you
<br>[say] need 2 out of 3 to gain a norm, or if you think that's what
<br>you need to win a tournament, or for your team to avoid relegation.
<br>Similarly if you are playing a weaker player, where you have to win
<br>or get egg on your face.&nbsp; If draws were worth only 0.4 or 0.3, it
<br>wouldn't change those pressures, and it seems to me that it would
<br>make precious little difference to how games were actually played.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>[...] My prediction is that
<br>players could easily adapt and that we would all
<br>be rewarded with better chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>As usual, you are assuming that encouraging players to play
<br>in a more murky style is "better chess".&nbsp; We can all agree that the
<br>12-move GM draw is bad for the image of the game;&nbsp; but it doesn't
<br>follow that playing for a small endgame advantage that you hope to
<br>convert is worse chess than speculative sacrifices that may or may
<br>not work.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>But we will
<br>never truly know the answer until we try. So
<br>why not try?
<br></blockquote>
<br>No-one is stopping you.&nbsp; Persuade your local club to run its
<br>championship by whatever scoring rules you like, and report back.
<br>If everyone who tries it says "Great!&nbsp; We had a draw-free tournament,
<br>and it was much more fun", then it may spread.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>The point is that in modern chess you cannot be successful
<br>without being able to draw a lot. That's what the empirical
<br>evidence tells us. No one has ever won Linares losing more
<br>than two games. [...]
<br></blockquote>
<br>Isn't that rather empirical evidence that you cannot be
<br>successful if you lose a lot?&nbsp; No surprise there, then.&nbsp; Yes,
<br>the tournament winners have wins and draws and occasional losses,
<br>and the tail-end charlies have losses and draws and occasional
<br>wins.&nbsp; Even if draws only score 0.4, I'm confident that you will
<br>still see that pattern, and what's more that you will still see
<br>people winning long GM tournaments by establishing some early
<br>wins and then cruising home by taking easy draws, or for that
<br>matter by being content to draw against their near-peers and
<br>being better than them at crunching the lower order.&nbsp; Indeed,
<br>it would likely increase the latter tendency, because losing to
<br>a rival would have increased significance.

<br>You posed that proposition.&nbsp; Who said anything about

<br>simply were chess lovers who chose to pour money into "their"
<br>game.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I like the idea of chess

<br>numbers of people who enjoy the activity.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It does.&nbsp; I freely admit that I have never tried to raise
<br>millions for a WC-standard event, but I have played my part in
<br>fund-raising at the local level, and we have always managed to
<br>persuade companies and individuals to part with hard cash to
<br>sponsor juniors or clubs, or to provide equipment, or to pay for
<br>venues, etc.&nbsp; Chess has a good image.&nbsp; The shenanigans around
<br>(a) post-1974 Fischer, (b) the split between FIDE and Kasparov,
<br>and (c) "toiletgate" and similar have IMNSHO done <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>far<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more to
<br>spoil that image than the number of draws at Corus.
