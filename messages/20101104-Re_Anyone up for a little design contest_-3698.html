Welcome to the club  :)  I've been working on this for months with no sign

What you might call a cycling finite game.  The idea is to have a
stones-and-grid affair in which stones can both be added to the board
and removed, through capture or some other mechanism, but where
nonetheless the game is guaranteed to end and give one winner.

Not to restrict it to death but one might impose that the two players, Black
and White, only place stones of their own color, one stone per turn, and
occasionally remove groups of orthogonally adjacent, like-colored stones,
completing a turn begun with a stone placement.

Filling a small, odd size board (like the 5x5 in Cepahlopod - see below) and
tallying the score is a good objective.  Filling a 19x19 board and tallying
the score could be cumbersome.  A game of annihilation is so much better for
a large board.  It's pretty clear who won.  You don't have to suffer through
the anticlimax of "Well we're done playing, but now we have to sit here
counting stones like idiots."

Whew, that's a lot of restrictions.  At the end of it, we're left with
Tanbo, Oust, and Go.

Tanbo:

and the goal cannot be accomplished by limiting
the number of stones (ala Gipf).

The stone limit rule is an aesthetic Hiroshima.

So, one example of this kind of game is Steere's Cephalopod (sp?),
which uses dice instead of stones.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Cephalopod played on a 25 square board can easily take upward of 140 moves.
140/25 = 5.6, a massive recycling factor, made possible with the added
dimension of dice.

The challenge I have in mind would restrict the designer to stones.

Good idea.

But there are many other possibilities.  One that Bill Taylor
suggested long ago, but which I find fascinating, is a pattern-
completion game with the Hex-like properties of one unique winner when
the board is full, but where the pattern is LOCAL instead of GLOBAL,
as in Hex.  By local I mean the pattern is not defined by anything
other than the relative arrangement of stones in the pattern.  4-in-a-
row is an example of a local pattern.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is something that has interested me as well, and I'm not saying it's
impossible, but the obvious problem is that I have my local 4-in-a-row, you
have your local 4-in-a-row, so who wins?  Symmetry tends to kill the
"Hex-like properties of one unique winner" in local win condition games
because I win in my locale and you win in your locale.  As I said though,
I'm not strictly ruling out any possibilities.
