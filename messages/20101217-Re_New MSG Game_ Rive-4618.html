Rodney Smitt played Rive one time and didn't have a clue.  Noted.  Fuck off.

Rive will probably turn out to be little more than a "concept game".  I..e.,
interesting architecturally, but not especially prized for its gameplay.  It
seems like a fun game to me, I've had some repeat players, and I can't
strictly rule out the possibility of meaningful tactics developing.  But I
can't rule it in either.

Actually me and my girlfriend played 3 whole games... regretfully. As
soon as someone says that they don't like your game you tell them to
fuck off? I think you have problems. Sorry but to put it bluntly this
game stinks!!!!! I have played few more dull games.  I liked Dipole so
I thought I might like this. HUGE mistake! I should've known better
after reading through the complicated rule sheet but that in itself
was such an investment of time and energy that it warranted playing
the infernal thing! Oh well live and learn.
