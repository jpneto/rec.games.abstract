Unusual!

If this game suffers a problem, my guess will be that it's hard to
keep the oddness of both groups and hypergroups in one's head well
enough to make useful projections about how the board will develop in
the course of a game, and therefore, to strategize.

I have a little of that difficulty keeping tracks of groups in Yodd
(not enough to be a huge negative, but a little), and I wouldn't want
that difficulty to get any worse.

But as usual, I'm speculating without having played a single move, so
this is just idle water-cooler chit chat.
