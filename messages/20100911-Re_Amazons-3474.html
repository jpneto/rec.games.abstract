You are right, it's subjective. But my decision to postpone Cage is
based on something that is easy to explain. When I played Cage I
didn't feel anything unique, i.e. there was no any "wow" effect. I
just saw another game in the Checkers family. Don't get me wrong, I
saw some nice tricks in Cage but the "overall" feeling was as I
described. If you offered me Cage like 2 years ago I would certainly
go for it but now there are plenty of games on igGC in that family. As
for the mentioned Konane, it didn't really cause me any "wow" effects
too and it is somehow in the same family but its rules are way
shorter. Given two games with no "wow" effect, the one with shorter
rules "wins". Besides, that Konane was proposed a year ago.

So there is nothing personal in it. I postponed Trilithon for the same
reason: there are plenty of connection games played on boards with the
hexagonal tessellation. Ok, it may have different strategical aspects
but all those bridges, templates and so on are pretty the same, which
gives that feeling "oh, another game like that..". When it was all
about Hex and Y, it was ok. At that time Atoll give me a great feeling
too. Even Havannah seemed nice (although it has never been my favorite
game and I can explain the reasons why I don't like it). But now the
feelings I get while playing all those games are pretty the same. So
Trilithon was postponed. So all your recent variations of connection
games were postponed as well. In contrast, playing Canvas gave me some
unique feeling. So it is in the list.
