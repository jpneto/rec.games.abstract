I'm doing a review for my game club's magazine and thought it might be of
interest here too:

     The biggest and best chess variant news of the year:  David
Pritchard's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Encyclopedia of Chess Variants<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (Godalming, Surrey: 
Games &amp; Puzzles Publications), ISBN 0-9524142-0-1, is finally
out, and worth the wait!  This is, to my knowledge, the biggest
CV publishing event of all time, in any language.  384 pages, 540
diagrams, 350 game scores, about 1450 variants including notes on
about 160 proprietary games.  Everyone interested in CVs should
order a copy <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>NOW<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  The price is �21.99, DM 63, or US$41, postpaid
anywhere up to 1 March 1995.  That's if you pay with a US bank
check; if you pay by credit card he doesn't have to pay
exorbitant bank fees, and the price will be closer to $36.  Just
send credit card number and expiration date as usual to Games &amp;
Puzzles Publications, PO Box 20, Godalming, Surrey GU8 4YP,
United Kingdom.  (Incidentally, G&amp;P Pubs. is not connected to the
newly revived Games &amp; Puzzles, of which more later.)
     [I haven't written that part yet, but if anyone's interested....]
     The book probably contains every CV ever played in NOST as
well as the thousand-plus that haven't been.  (Well, not all the
combined games like Doublemove Dynamo Shatranj, but everything
else.)  I haven't been able to think of a significant game, aside
from the most recent innovations, that isn't in the book.
     To give you an idea of the inclusiveness of this book:  the
'four-handed chess' section is almost 7 pages long, discussing 26
variants, two of them (Verney's and Hughes-Hughes's) in detail,
including discussions of openings and endings; there are cross
references to three of the four-handed commercial games, and
individual sections on nine other four-handed CVs follow.  The
'hexagonal chess' section is 5 pages, 6 variants (those of
Gli ski and Brusky discussed in some detail), with cross-
references to 6 more.  The 'three-dimensional chess' section is 4
pages, discussing 16 variants, with cross-references to 8 more,
and yet another 3 immediately following in their own sections. 
Among the other major sections are those on kriegspiel (4 pages),
progressive chesses (8 pages), shogi (10 pages), and XiangQi (9�
pages).  There are 1� pages on Avalanche, with six sample games;
almost 2 on Dynamo, with 3 sample games, and two of Doublemove
Dynamo; 1� on Knight Relay, with 7 games; and so on.
