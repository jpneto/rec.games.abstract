Interesting! What's the algorithm, standard alpha-beta? I suspect
you'd need more skill than I have at visualizing 4D space to defeat
the program. (Has anyone done so yet?)

There's no look-ahead,  I figured the branching was too much
(625 first moves).  The The algorithm for rating a move is
that it assigns a "score" for each row that the square includes
and just adds them.  I didn't try to hard to optimize what the
"scores" were, I just wanted to make sure that the "score"
for a row that already contains 4 of your guys is much higher than
anything else (so the computer iswill win if it can),  the score
for a row with 4 of the enemy's guys is high enough that it will
block your attempts at winning, and so on.  A row that has
at least one of each type already is worth nothing,  but an
empty row is worth a little so it will preferentially make moves
that are part of more rows.  The center square is part of
40 different rows!

I've always loved this algorithm.  I was writing a 4dTTT for a machine
with 8k RAM (it was 1982,) and this was the only way to get fast,
good play.  A smart player can often beat it, but the computer plays 
sensible, "intelligent" moves all the time.
