None, by definition.  There is no such thing as a problem that

Turing Machine, because a Turing Machines can simulate all

The above quote doesn't say that a Turing machine cannot simulate
a Quantum Computer, only that it cannot do so in an efficient way,
which is what I originally wrote.  Do you have a quote supporting 
your claim that a Turing machine cannot simulate all computers?

"There were apparently 40 paradoxes of plurality, attempting to show
that ontological pluralism  a belief in the existence of many things
rather than only one  leads to absurd conclusions; of these paradoxes
only two definitely survive, though a third argument can probably be
attributed to Zeno."
Mapping entangled computation to a Turing tape seems to be like Zeno's
race between the tortoise and the hare--its logical but misses the
point.

I would (should?)  never claim that a Turing machine could not, in
theory, simulate all computers. Nor do I doubt that a Cray XT5 or
some such monster (the internet, a la the world community grid?) could
provide the chess analysis necessary (given enough time.)  The focus
should be on how would the quantum chess metaphor enrich the game, not
what non-human mechanism could handle the play.
