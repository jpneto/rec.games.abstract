Let me try to recreate the draw moment from 18 years ago.  I have the memory
of a fruit fly, but it was such vile trauma that it made an indelible
impression.

The first thing to note was the rivalrous atmosphere.  Yes, everyone came to
my apartment, or a neighbor's apartment, to smoke pot, on the one hand.  But
when it came to the game, it was bloodsport.  Quadrature is essentially a
game of annihilation, though sometimes you win by slipping through and
getting three guys in the far goal area.  "Winning the race" like that isn't
nearly as satisfying as winning by annihilation.  You only beat your
opponent.  You don't kill him.

Maybe it's the age, I'm satisfied to beat an opponent ...
We had a very good Chess player at 'Fanatic' who <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>loved<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> draws. He
wrapped you in a warm blanket of amicality and then suddenly your
queen would be pinned. He always apologized, he didn't mean to win,
he'd much rather have seen a draw, but, well, there it was ...

Me and a friend were playing Quadrature one afternoon.  Fortunately we were
the only two in attendance.  The game started taking too long.  It was a
convoluted aggressive exchange that wasn't moving forward.  My opponent was
the first to say something.  At first I didn't believe it but after a couple
more moves in the cycle it was clear we were having a draw.  It was totally
embarrassing both that I didn't even know there could be a draw, and that
there was now something wrong with my great game that everyone seemed to
love.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Maybe it was only wrong because you'd perceived it as drawless. I
remember a student whose name I forgot, coming in and demonstrating
the instant threefold in Hexemergo. It was great fun! Nobody thought
"hey, a cycle, let's get out of here!"

We're left sitting there like, Now what the fuck do we do?  Suited up, ready
to die, and battle already well under way, our gladiator event is suddenly
cancelled due to rain.  Crap.

Another time, another kill :)
I was fortunate enough, by the way, to make a first game so full of
complicated crap that I vowed for simplicity ever after.

In Havannah draws are interesting because they're so rare.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

We may have to agree to disagree on this point, Christian.  I've been having
this argument with a lot of people for a lot of years, and the notion of the
"rare, interesting draw" continues to elude me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Well, before Havannah landed at LG and the computer guys came in,
there was only a rumour of a draw that had once occured.
When the programs started on base-4 boards, and eventually got better,
the first real draws would tickle in (both bot v bot and bot v human).
Now we've had them at base-5 too, and one base-6 if I recall
correctly. Still thousands of games base-7 and up, without a single
draw. That's interesting I think.

Symple cannot end in a draw, Sygo can, yet Sygo is the better game.

Now here we can agree to agree, in principle.  Quadrature is really one of
my best games if you're ok with rare draws.

A couple months back, I was wasting time playing Checkers online, and there
was a precise moment when we crossed into the waltzing phase - kings chasing
each other around the board.  I felt a physical welling up - a desperately
unpleasant sensation akin to acute claustrophobia.  I couldn't shut the
fucking game window fast enough and run outside to gulp fresh air.  No time
for a pleasant exchange of gg's.  Panic was setting in.  Cya!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I'd rather not play Checkers then. In fact I'd rather not play
Checkers. But in, say, Dameo, two kings win against one, so you can
forget about walzing.

I've got an extremely low tolerance for boredom.  My life is going by and
I'm sitting here pointlessly shuffling pieces around in an endless cycle.

There's nothing at all I can do against the notion that my life is
going by, whether pointlessly pushing wood or pointlessly pushing
religion, politics, ideals, whatever.
I think life <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> pointless - that's why I take games very seriously.
