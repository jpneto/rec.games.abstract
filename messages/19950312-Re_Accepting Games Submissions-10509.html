We are now accepting submissions for original and unique games to sell 
out of a mail-order catalog. We would like to offer a variety of games in 
boxed and book formats. Our plan is to cover the costs of printing and 
shipping while giving the designer a commission (5-10%). The designer 
will always keep the rights to his game and will be able to sell their 
game elsewhere as well. We would like to specialize in strategy and 
adventure games but would consider any game that may be put in a boxed or 
book format. Thank you.

Any other information you'd like to share?  Like what your group is 
called?  where you are located?  What format submissions should be in?
etc.
