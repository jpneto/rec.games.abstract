Ok it's settled.  My flatmate Declan will vote on his

I think we might be onto something with the judge idea, but it needs be
someone with a little more cachet than your flatmate, no offense.  Does
anyone have a rapport with Wayne?  He only responds to about half of my
emails but I could give it a shot.

ANOTHER proposal for the next contest is to have the games submitted
ANONYMOUSLY to a Common Area, such as Greg has started for this
contest.  If the inventor can sufficiently hide his or her identity in
the presentation of the entry, then we can allow everyone to vote.
The only thing voters will see are the games themselves and something
like Inventor #6, not the personalities behind them.  Still, while no
one would be allowed to vote for their own game, 200 sockpuppets
could.  How do we get around this?  Have Greg or Daniel keep a list of
registered voters?  Registered voters kinda suck, but may be needed.
Would some one actually register 200 sockpuppet email addresses?
Remember, this is not a contest to win a Yacht.

Now what about my case?  I have 2 addresses I use and another 2 that I
never use anymore.  How would the Keeper of the List figure out that
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:greystone@net1plus.com">greystone@net1plus.com</a> == <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:xongsmith@gmail.com">xongsmith@gmail.com</a>?  If we use ISPs, then
weirder things happen - my ISP numbers arent necessarily the same
everytime I dial up - being handed out dynamically at the time of
connection.  Within a session they may be the same, but the voting
would be spread out across several days, I would imagine.

This problem manifests itself in a similar on the IGS as well.
