Rings don't particularly appeal to me but dice do.  And I was inspired by your dice game.  I spent a few days, or nights I should say, when I couldn't sleep, trying to come up with a luck/strategy game for dice, and didn't get anywhere.  Maybe I'll return to that and see if I can make any forward progress.

My black jack dice game was inspired by a problem I was trying to solve. I sent finally my problem to projecteuler.forum. 2 days after my problem disappear. I found a mail from the administrator telling me that the problem is now discussed by few members to submit it as Euler Problem. He invited me to participate. I refused because I hate to be slave of others agenda.
I wanted and still want to stay free.
