A student here recently lent me a computer game (from a few years back)
entitled "Seventh Guest". The player moves from room to room in a 
creepy house solving various puzzles. One of the puzzles is a game
which you play against an unseen opponent. I wonder if anyone has
done an analysis of this game?

It's Othello-like: Two players, each initially having tokens at a pair
of opposite corners of a 7x7 checkerboard. Players take turns placing
their tokens on the board's squares until all the playing places are
filled; the winner is the player controlling the greatest number of
squares when the game is over.

A player's move consists of moving a token from position (x,y) to
position (x',y'), where 
   That player has a token at position (x,y)
   Position (x', y') is vacant
   | x - x' | &lt; 3,  and likewise | y - y'| &lt; 3
(If a player has no valid moves, s/he forfeits that turn and play
passes to the opponent.)

When the player moves the token, several changes take place:
   The player now has a token at position (x', y')
   Position (x,y) is now vacant IF  |x-x'| = 2  OR |y-y'| = 2
   Any opponent's token at (x'', y'') is replaced by this player's token
     there, if  | x' - x'' | &lt; 2  and | y' - y'' | &lt; 2.

In other words, you can either "stretch" your token into two, or "jump"
a distance of 2; and then you "convert" your new "neighbors".


Note that the game can consist of well over 49 turns. 
Indeed, it is possible to go into an infinite loop, so there ought
to be a rule against repeating a board configuration, or something,
but no such rule is provided in the game.

I played a few rounds by hand against the machine, and cobbled together
a lame simulation which looks ahead a couple of moves to choose the
best move (by a very stupid evaluation strategy). I don't see an obvious
winning strategy for either player, though the player to go first 
seems to have a bit of an advantage.


Compared to regular Othello/Reversi, there are some differences in play:

1. Most of the action and analysis takes place near the boundary between
filled and empty regions: deeply-buried pieces (for either player)
cannot change the outcome. This is not completely true though: because
of the "jump" moves, pieces away from the boundary can come back into
play several moves later as their neighbors percolate away through the
boundary.

2. There are no simple "permanently-safe" positions; for example, a
row of three tokens, including one in a corner, can be converted to the
opponent's side if the opponent plays the location adjacent to the
center of the three. On the other hand, as noticed in #1, pieces which
are deep inside the filled region are difficult to convert.


If there is a quick winning strategy for the player who goes first,
that will put an end to this puzzle and I can go on playing the 
larger compter game...
