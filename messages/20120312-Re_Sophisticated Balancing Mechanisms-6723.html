After reading Mark's endorsement, I gave Ketchup a second look.  The
negative feedback mechanism not only balances the game, it also makes
the tactics more interesting because the players space their stones
apart a little bit for a while instead of just lumping them together
from the beginning.  So, although the goal is to create the biggest
"meatball," the game avoids the slowness and predictability that
generally accompanies meatball tactics.

The change Nate made to create Ketchup 4.0. seems to be quite
important because it increases the game's temperature.  Coldness in a
game can be very interesting, but only if --- in my opinion, anyway
--- the game is hotter than it is cold.  Too much coldness takes the
excitement out by forcing the players to sit back on their heels.
