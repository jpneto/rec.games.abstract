No there doesn't and the point is irrelevant anyway.  If and when
something happens for the first time, such a statement of surprise

I think definitely not.  This is in fact exactly the misconception that
cost Kasparov the match against Deep Blue.

I corrected you once before on this point; the situation referred to
occurred in the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>PREVIOUS<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> match that Kasparov won.  From this loss,
he learned enough about how Deep Blue was choosing its move to
quickly come back and win the match in convincing fashion (in the
remaining 5 games, Kasparov won 3 and drew 2).

In the final match, Kasparov was never able to figure out the
reasons for Deep Blue's moves and that was a big reason for his
loss.

But in any case, neither match is relevant to my point.

While much of what you say is interesting in its own right,
its at best only tangentially related to anything I'm saying.
If you simply have something you want to say on a similar topic,
then I would appreciate it if you would start a new thread
instead of pretending to address my points.  If you want to
disagree with what I'm saying, then I would appreciate it if
you would address my point instead of rambling on about some
tangentially related topic.

The only point I made was in response to a general definition
of strategy and tactics.  I pointed out that while it was a
reasonable general definition, that it was difficult to
impossible to make a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>precise<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> definition.  Not once have
you addressed my point.  Instead you have posted pages and
pages of stuff that have little to do with the difference
between strategy and tactics.  I don't know why I'm even still
bothering.
