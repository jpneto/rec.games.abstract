gtkboard only intuitively supports rectangular boards.  You'd have
to do something like splitting the square cells into triangles and
conceptualizing the game that way.  OTOH, if you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> do that, I
bet you'd get a lot of props from the gtkboard devteam! :-)

Back to pentominoes, now...

I have downloaded the current build, and I'm currently working on
the gtkboard interface for Capture Pentominoes.  At the moment,
my idea is to store the state of the board internally as an
array of characters in the format I posted in the first message:

   .......
   ....N..
   ..wNN..
   .wwNL..
   ww.NL..
   ....L..
   ....LL.

 &gt;
 &gt; where the lowercase letters represent the most recent move.  Then
 &gt; checking for captures merely entails making a list of all the
 &gt; 84 edges on the board, and looking at the cells on either side of
 &gt; each edge.

good! [...]

The hardest thing about gtkboard, I think, is that as far as I
can tell its interface is limited to "capture a click somewhere on
the board", which means it'll be a pain to select and place
irregular figures like pentominoes.  Maybe it needs a full
user interface, something like the following very bad ascii-art:

            --------------
  FILNPT   |              |
  UVWXYZ   |              |
  ------   |  the game    |
-|   =  |- |   board      |
&lt;| I=I  |&gt;||              |  ----
-| =    |- |              | | rm |
  ------   |              |  ----
            --------------

   To remove a piece:
     Click the piece to select it.
     Click "remove".
   To place a new piece:
     Click the letter corresponding to the piece.
     The piece will appear in the left-hand window.
     Click the left and right arrows to rotate the piece.
     Click one of the squares on the piece.
     Click an empty square on the board.
     The piece will be placed with the two squares coinciding.

That's a rather involved interface, and even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>more<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> involved
for the programmer!  I'm not sure how to get around this.
Ideas welcome.

  you probably would have enough room to have the 12 guys drawn
  off to the side.  then you {mouse over} &amp; click to select it.
  at this point it is stuck to your mouse pointer
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nope, I don't think gtkboard can do that.  I think it was the Chess
game that had a comment like "drag &amp; drop isn't working yet," but
even so I think they didn't mean that you could <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>see<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> what you were
dragging, just that you should be able to make a move in one mouse
motion instead of two.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
  &amp; drags along
  with it.  a click rotates it to the right, a SHIFT-click to
  the left (because MAC mice only have 1 button), and then
  CONTROL-click flips it over if it is asymmetrical &amp; you need
  the other side of the pentomino.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Dang!  I completely forgot about flipping-over when I wrote up
that ascii-art interface.  Add <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>another<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> button to flip the selected
piece over a vertical axis.

And AFAIK each "clickable" thing in gtkboard has to be a "cell" on
the "board," so even though the board is conceptually only 7x7, I'll
end up with a board that's like 15x12 by the time the interface is
done.

  in my java Xong app i have the release of dragging the piece
  drop the piece, nestling it into a legal position, so you dont
  have to have single-pixel precision in your fingertips.

  then you may wish to have a COMMIT MOVE button somewhere to
  make the move, as opposed to just dragging it around &amp; trying
  it out in several places whiler you drink another cup of coffee.

  but gtk may not go for this.  ;-)

Yeh.  Nice, though. :-)

I don't yet have access to a Linux graphical testbed, but I will
in less than two weeks now.  (School. :))  Then I expect to be able
to run what I have so far, and see how it really looks.
