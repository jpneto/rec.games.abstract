Here is a game for any plural number of players.

Needed: Blank piece of paper, compass.

First, with the compass, draw two circles of the same radius, with
each circle passing through the other's center.

Players take turns. On a player's turn, he/she draws a circle (with
the compass, of course) of any positive radius such that the center of
the circle is at the intersection of at least two previously-drawn
circles. The number of intersections passed through by this new circle
-- each intersection of at least two previously drawn circles and of
the circle just drawn by the player -- is added to the player's score.
Note: The number of intersections (each of any number of circles), not
the total number of circles in these intersections, is added to the
player's score.

No two circles may have both the same radius and same center. (No two
circles can coincide completely.)

The first player to reach a predetermined number of points wins.
(I suggest a higher goal score for a larger piece of paper and larger
initial circles. I suggest a lower goal score if there a more than
just a couple players.)

Note: If 3 or more circles ALMOST intersect at a point -- but their
exact point of coinciding is uncertain because the circles were poorly
drawn -- use geometric theorems to determine if indeed the three or
more circles coincide <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>officially<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> at that point.
