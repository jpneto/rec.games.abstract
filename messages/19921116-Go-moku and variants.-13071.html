Go-moku, more popularly known in the West as "5-in-a-row", will be familiar
to all readers here.  The Japanese version has many artificial restrictions
on the first player, intended to make the game more even. These have never
had much following in the West, whose players (being mostly mathematicians
&amp; programmers) prefer the "cleaner" version, (and deal with the advantage
of first move, (if at all), by playing pairs of games). In the usual western
version, lines of more than 5 win (i.e. exactly 5 is not required); there
are no restrictions on "double-3"s; and the board is infinite (in principle).

There has been an ongoing controversy, in various newsgroups, as to whether
or not Japanese experts had proved that (the unrestricted version of)
5-in-a-row is a 1st player win, with perfect play. The general concensus
was that they had not done so; though no one doubted the fact itself was
true. Finally the issue was resolved once and for all at a recent computer-game
meeting, reported on the net (and in New Scientist); some games programmers
had produced a perfect programs, to win 5-in-a-row as 1st-player.

Question 1: Does anyone have any info on the minimum # moves needed to win ?
~~~~~~~~~~
6-in-a-row, as far as I know, is completely open as to whether it is a
1st-player win, or a draw. 

Question 2: Does anyone have any insights or guesses they'd care to share as 
~~~~~~~~~~  to which of these is the case, and why ?

It has long been known that 9-in-a-row, (or longer), is an easy draw. 
The standard proof is similar to the one given below for "ortho-5-in-a-row".
A more complex proof, of the same basic type, shows that 8-in-a-row is a
draw, and hints (and "half-proves") that 7-in-a-row is a draw as well. Refs
may be found in the appropriate section of "Winning Ways" (Conway et al).

But this still leaves the case of 6-in-a-row wide open.

Less interesting to game players, but of interest to game analysers, is the
game of "ortho-n-in-a-row", in which only horizontal &amp; vertical rows count.

Ortho-4-in-a-row is a fairly easy 1st-player-win. My analysis makes it that
player-1 can win on move 15 (i.e. his own 8th move); with perfect play.

Question 3: Can anyone produce an improvement on this 15-move win ?
~~~~~~~~~~
Ortho-5-in-a-row is seen to be a draw by the following   A A B C A A...
simple strategy. 2nd-player mentally partitions the      D D B C D D...
plane into cell-pairs, as shown in the diagram. (The     E F G G E F...
pattern is to be considered repeated indefinitely over   E F H H...
the plane). Then whenever 1st-player takes one cell of   ...
a pair, 2nd-player takes the other. Thus 1st-player can never get more than 
4 in a row. (A similar pattern, with diagonal pairs also, can easily be 
constructed on an 8x8 board fragment, that shows normal 9-in-a-row is a draw. 
Details left as excercise.)

It is interesting that ortho-n-in-a-row can be easily resolved, for all n.

It may be a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> long time before normal 6- (&amp; maybe 7-)in-a-row are decided.

-----------------

TWO-MOVE VARIANT.

Another variant of n-in-a-row, that attempts to equalize the advantage
between 1st &amp; 2nd moves, is the 1-2-2-2-... variant;  where the 1st plaver
has one move, then both have 2 successive moves thereafter. In this form,
I calculate that there is still a fairly easy win for 1st-mover in 5-in-a-row,
a fairly easy win for 2nd-mover in 6-in-a-row; and an easy drawing strategy of
the type above (now requiring 3-cell partitions), for 13-in-a-row, which
probably extends simply to 12-in-a-row.

Question 4,5,6,7: Can anyone confirm these results independently ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Question 8: Can anyone make a start on filling in the gap between 6 and 12 ?
