Of course it tells about human beings that play the game; IMHO the
players playing a game is one of the most important parts of the game.
For example they have developed the body of know strategies that all
players are more or less expected to know. Playing the
same game from the scratch is quite different from playing under
circumstances when there's a well-developed set of strategies to
utilize.

Furthermore, I doubt that there's any meaningful concept of the
difficulty of a game per se, not regarding the human players.
Mathematically, there are for full-information, two-player non-random
games just two kinds of plays: The correct ones (that conform to the
winning strategy) and the incorrect ones. This is true for both complex
games like go and simple games like tic-tac-toe. What makes the
difference between go and tic-tac-toe is the difficulty <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>for_humans<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to
find or at least approximate the correct moves. Furthermore, there's no
meaningful non-human concept of approximating correct moves. Even that
must be thought so that a good approximation is such that the human
opponent does not know how to answer it correctly (or by an
approximation of correct ((this is recursive, not circular 
characterization)) ).

The number of branches is not the correct way to measure difficulty,
since one can construct very easy games with high branching. Let N and M be 
natural numbers. Then we construct a game so that first player a chooses
a number from 0-N. Then B chooses the number from 0-N. Then A chooses a number
0-N. This is repeated M times. Then we sum up all numbers
chosen, and if the sum can be divided by N, A wins. Otherwise B wins.
There's a very easy winning strategy for the player choosing last (at
every stage calculate S = the sum mod N , and as A choose last N-S and
as B any other number), so the game is simple, but it branches very much
for big values of N and M.
