Christian, I like both Soar and Jump Sturdy.  I am a bigger proponent
than you of Breakthrough-type games; I think they have a lot of
tension and sharp decision making and have used this goal in several
of my own designs, two of which are still unreleased, all of which are
draw-proof.  Of the two I think I will enjoy Jump Sturdy a little more
because I don't have a lot of confidence of my ability to visualize
and plan for the explosions and chain reaction explosions than can
occur in Soar, although it's also not clear to me just how often those
chain reactions will occur and how many events there will be in the
chain, so they might be more manageable than what I imagine.  Not
having a game in the contest, I guess I don't get a vote, but so far I
lean toward Monkey Queen, with Jump Sturdy a close second.  I would
love Stax except for the hidden information problem.

Hi Michael,

Spot on I'd say. I tend to disagree however with "tension and sharp
decision making" being the sole criteria for a good game, but maybe we
don't even disagree there. I feel JS is the better game _for the
contest_ but Soar is a more complete cycle: nothingness to fullness to
nothingness. It's a philosophical argument.

There's also game-play, and with it taste and temperament enter the
equation. We're living in hasty times full of distractions, so the
more familiar and accessible a game is, the faster it is absorbed to a
sufficient degree to make a considered choice. That's where I saw Soar
fail :)

Hi Gert,

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.doodle.com">https://www.doodle.com</a> seems the right place to poll all right. I
considered making one, but then, it's Daniels contest and there's no
hurry.
