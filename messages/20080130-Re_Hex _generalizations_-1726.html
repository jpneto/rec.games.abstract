<br><blockquote type=cite>There is only one generalization of Hex: Atoll.&nbsp; Atoll is a precisely
<br>defined, infinite set of games all of whose members share the central,
<br>defining, geometric principals of Hex: The goal is to connect opposite
<br>segments, and on a filled board you have exactly one winner.&nbsp; In the
<br>special case of Atoll in which the set member has the least allowable
<br>number of perimeter segments, four, Atoll is exactly equivalent to
<br>Hex.
<br>
<br>Mind Ninja is certainly a variation of Hex, or a family of variations
<br>of Hex.&nbsp; I don't mean to impugn Mind Ninja.&nbsp; I'm sure it's a wonderful
<br>game, having been created by the talented designer Nick Bentley.&nbsp; But
<br>it's not a generalization of Hex, or Atoll, or anything else that I'm
<br>aware of.&nbsp; It certainly doesn't "encompass" Atoll.

<br>Having just now heard about and googled Mind Ninja, it certainly sounds
<br>like a generalization of both:&nbsp; The goal is to get from a starting
<br>arrangement to a type of ending arrangement (both of which are chosen by
<br>one of the players).&nbsp; In the special case of Mind Ninja in which the
<br>player chooses the starting arrangement "empty board" and the type of
<br>ending arrangement "connect opposite segments", Mind Ninja is exactly
<br>equivalent to Atoll.
<br>
<br>There's an initial bidding war that appears to serve as a handicap of
<br>some sort.&nbsp; Also, you may well be intending "generalization" and/or
<br>"superset" to indicate that all cases within the larger set involve
<br>similar strategies to those within the smaller set, in which case it
<br>would be much more reasonable to say that Mind Ninja is not a
<br>generalization of Atoll after all; "connect opposite segments" involves
<br>different strategies than, say, "create a solid 3x3 block" or "create
<br>the corners of three different squares of any size and orientation".
