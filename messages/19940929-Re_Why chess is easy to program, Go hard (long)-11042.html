I believe that go is harder to program than chess for three reasons:

1. The mathematical state space of go is vastly larger than chess.  As has
  been noted, chess programs have taken brute force technique far beyond
  the wildest imaginings of the early chess programmers.  Because such
  techniques have been successful, there has been little incentive to
  try and develop chess programs that attempt to mimic the thought
  processes of human grandmasters (or even to probe what those thought
  processes might really be).  But the "gap" between chess and go is
  so large (at least 100 orders of magnitude) that no amount of cleverness
  or improvement in hardware speeds seems likely to yield similar 
  successes in the realm of go.  If strong go programs arise, it will be
  because they manage to play go in ways recognizably more similar to
  the way human masters play than is the case for chess programs.

2. Go is far more symmetric than chess.  The different pieces and their
  moves actually makes tactical analysis easier in chess than in go.
  In go the value of a stone is a function of its relationship to other
  stones rather than to anything intrinsic.  While sacrifice technique
  can violate the normal material relationship among pieces in chess,
  it is almost always the case that a queen is worth more than a knight.
  Moreover, in chess significant sacrifices are almost invariably coupled
  to a mating attack of some sort which will decide the game fairly
  quickly.  In go, the amorphous nature of stones means that sacrifices
  tend to have more abstract strategic purposes even when they seemingly
  involve large amounts of "material".

3. Go evaluation functions must be global to be meaninful whereas chess
  does quite well with local evaluation functions.  This means that not
  only does a go program need to consider many more positions than a
  chess program, but it needs to spend much more time considering each
  position if it is to do anything meaningful with it.  This only compounds
  the problem of trying to duplicate the "brute force" success of
  chess programs in go.

On this subject, David Ehrbach's article on computers and go in the Go
Player's Almanac (Ishi) is recommended for many other insights into this
subject.  I feel confident in predicting that the Ing prize will remain
unclaimed during the lifetime of anyone reading this post.  Programming go
is a very hard problem.

That is for sure: you need a knowledge based programm to play go.
Only evaluating important moves made, and no (for human evident) 
nonsens like brute force programms do.

But i guess there still will be programms that play go.
Like to know more about these programms (i want to make a knowledge
based chessprogramm), someone knows a guy who did it and want to talk
about it?
