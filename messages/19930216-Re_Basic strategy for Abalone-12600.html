	hello,

	Abalone is quite a new game, so basic strategie are not well
	known yet. But I've read some articles about it in a french
	magazin which has disappeared. I only remember that there
	was one or two geometric figure which were strong :
	-the triangular  *
                         **
                        ***
	-the losange (hope it's the same word in english !)
	 with 9 pawns.
	It's not a great information, but these were coming
	from a young french federation of Abalone, which was
	also at that time, studying for a system of notation.

	I will look if I can get more info about the FFA.
