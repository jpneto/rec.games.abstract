There is also a commercial version of the software that was licensed by
Milton Bradley to, I think, Accolade.  It allowed for several levels of
difficulty, which an experience Stratego player should have no problem
beating.  It allowed for a number of "house rules" such as whether the
winning piece replaced the losing piece's location; and whether ties
went to the attacker.  These change the playing strategy completely.

Somewhat true.  There is a lot of deception that can go on when playing
each of the different rule sets; however, my tactics include slipping a
Major or Colonel into the back lines and hacking away at the smaller
pieces until you force your opponent to commit a large piece to the defense
or you locate a possible flag "enclave".  It's amazing how many quick
wins you can get when you commit yourself to the offense, especially when
you have the other "channels" of attack and/or retreat blocked.

players I know).

This is true.  If both players choose defense, it's a boring game.  But...
like I said above, a person that plays defense can get his pieces blocked
in (as he can't move though his own pieces) and, through the loss of 
mobility, not be able to respond to a coordinated attack.  And of course, 
if you always surround your flag with bombs, killing off all your 
opponents miners kinda gives you tremendous operational flexibility.

Cheers.
