I'd wondered how long you would last on BGG, considering how eager
Octavian is with the ban-hammer. So far I've been impressed at your
restraint, and amused at how much it must have gnawed on your liver to
not get to call me names. Now, not even the opportunity to casually
promote your games without mentioning that you're the author ("Oust is
a much better game! Play a real game, like Cephalopod!") could keep
you there.

But it was only a matter of time, I suppose.

Great news, though. Everyone, there is a Mark Steere-free forum to
discuss abstract games!
