This can be considered both a puzzle and a solitaire game.

Make an n-by-n grid on paper. (I suggest that n = 3 for beginners.)

Fill the grid with UNIQUE positive integers, one integer per square of
the grid. The numbers need not be consecutively valued necessarily.

Your score is the largest integer m such that integers 1 through m all
occur as sums within the grid (without missing any positive integers
&lt;=m).

A "sum" is of any number of addends (possibly just 1) that are all
consecutively placed within a row of the grid or a column of the grid.
(No diagonals in this variation.)

So, for example, if we have the following 3-by-3 grid:

2 9 8
3 1 10
7 6 15

...the sums 1 through 19 all occur in this grid. So, I get a score of
19.
(Notice that some values of sums occur more than once.)

I bet it is easy to do better than I did with a 3-by-3 grid, since my
grid is inefficient, and I didn't try too hard to find it.

(Note: There are 27 possible sums in a 3-by-3 grid of 1, 2, or 3
addends. I don't know what the largest possible score is for a 3-by-3
grid, though.)

You can "play" someone else by both of you trying to score as well as
you can on the same-sized grid. Just try to outscore your opponent.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

For the 4x4 grid, the maximum possible score is at least 55.

See below the spoiler for the grid I found with a score of 55.
