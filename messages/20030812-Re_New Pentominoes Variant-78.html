<br>&nbsp;of course, the way they get placed down on the board
<br>&nbsp;in a game condition will be at odds with the way they
<br>&nbsp;get layed down when you are trying to fit the all on
<br>&nbsp;the board.

<br>&nbsp;another avenue would be to employ 2 sets of pentominoes.
<br>&nbsp;a long time ago, in the 60's, my dad brought home a game
<br>&nbsp;called Pan-Kai.&nbsp; there were 2 sets, in 2 colors.&nbsp; the
<br>&nbsp;game was for the last move.&nbsp; you could wall off a vacant
<br>&nbsp;shape matching a piece your opponent had played, but you
<br>&nbsp;had not yet, and thus secure an extra move at the end.
<br>&nbsp;your opponent would be attempting to do the same.&nbsp; because
<br>&nbsp;there were 24 pieces, the board was expanded to 10x10.
