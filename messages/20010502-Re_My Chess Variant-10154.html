Gianni, did you find that defense becomes more difficult since
protected pieces really aren't protected?  Wouldn't one go all out
on the offensive alternating moves among a set of attackers?  Pretty
hard to lose a piece playing offense.  Does the game play as if there's
incomplete information/communication?  If so then having a "play book"
(e.g. unusual opening) becomes really important.

Some time ago I had tried to come up with a "Vulcan" chess variant
that's kind of related to your game -- one would disclose to the
opponent all possible next moves.  The "mind-meld" mechanism works like
this:

White moves, and discloses up to N choices for White's second move
(and later has to choose one of them, of course).  Black moves and
disclose up to N possible choices for Black's second move.  And so on.

I haven't explicitly tried it but games with myself already have this
flavor :-)  This is thematically related to my Ferengi Chessgi which
is based on the principle of greed:

(Excerpt)
Rules of Acquisition
Object of the game is both to checkmate the opponent and to have acquired
the
most material <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>in hand<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> at the time the game ends -- scored using the usual
point values (king counts zero). The losing player does not score. If draw
is agreed, each player scores his/her acquisitions. First player to 100
points
wins the match. Exchanges are encouraged, as pieces left on the board do
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
count. Resigning is discouraged by a 10 point penalty. Chessgi rules apply
(promoted pawn does not revert when captured); however, dropping a piece
is actually a <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>sacrifice<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> made in order to capture more pieces or to end the
game.

Point values [help?]: Queen 8, Rook 5, Bishop 3, Knight 3, Pawn 1, King 0

One goal of this variant is to counterbalance the drop -- is this
advantageous?
Question: Does Chessgi ever end in a draw? (Ferengi Chessgi probably will.)

My other chess variant (or family thereof) is ChineseCheckersChess, also

Hi, what is your design goal?  I first thought it might have been
to equalize White and Black, but that's not it.  -- William

Hi William,

well, I must admit that my first goal was only to produce an original game
concept... I have a fair knowledge of abstract strategy games, and I never
encountered a game in which the usual sequence of move: "choose a piece,
move that piece" is inverted.

Then, I encountered the problem that Queens were too powerful: a Queens
always chosen and moved in the opposite camp was an havoc. So the rule
"never choose a piece twice" was a fair fix.

I did not played the game extensively, I did some games against Zillions
(thanks, Stephen!)... the resulting game dynamic is not astonishing, but
sometimes I found some interesting situations...

bye,
G.
