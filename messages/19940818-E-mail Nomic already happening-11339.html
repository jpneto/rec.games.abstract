Several posts have appeared here recently wondering about the possibility
of Nomic by email. For those of you to whom this subject is of interest
I have good news: the possibility is already a fully fledged reality.
There are a number of eNomic games happening already. I am currently
participating in a game which has been going on for about 15 months,
and there are a number of other games happening elsewhere. However, I
believe (although I may be wrong) that the other games try to keep
players numbers down. Agora Nomic, for such is our name, encourages
all interested parties to join and play with us. If you are
interested, mail

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au">listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au</a>

with no subject and "SUB nomic" in the body of the message.

Also, Malcom Ryan maintains a Nomic FAQ which contains details of all
the e-mail Nomic games currently in existence and their characteristics.
I believe he will be reposting the FAQ here shortly.

I look forward to hearing from you in Agora Nomic!
