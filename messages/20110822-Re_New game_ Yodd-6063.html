Here are some basic insights on Yodd strategy:

Outlining frameworks is also important, because:

b) In the middlegame, I'm excited to say that Yodd seems to have a
noteworthy territorial component, after all. It should be customary
for the players to try and surround territories at least three cells
wide to secure the creation of at least one opponent group there. As
this group is already doomed, while your surrounding chain can still
expect to join other groups, the local result will favor you. Of
course, the bigger the territories, the more opponent groups you can
accommodate there. Your opponent will have a hard time either
connecting said groups to each other or, even worse, creating groups
of your color, as you will likely be able to connect them to your
surrounding chain. So creating territories is key, even if this, as
opposed to Omega, was meant to be a pure connection game.

Isn't it curious how thin the line between connection and territory
games can be? I dare state the obvious: the more (potentially or
explicitly) numerous the entities you must connect (stones, groups,
edge cells...), the more your game leans towards the territory side.

What I particularly like about Yodd is the kind of simplicity at the core.
Don't meddle with the board, just make sure the number of groups is
odd. To realize that it doesn't involve counting must have been an
"Aha" moment.

Indeed! I had been playing with the "less groups wins" winning
condition for some time, but the most obvious implementation didn't
work because of ties. I went so far as to consider the following
awkward rule to avoid them: "The player with less groups wins. In case
of a tie, groups of size 1 aren't counted. If there's still a tie,
groups of size 2 aren't counted, too, and so on till there is a
winner." Plausible, but hardly elegant. I knew that the best way to
avoid ties was to actually check the number of groups at the end of
each turn, but it took me a while to realize that it could be done in
such a subtle and satisfactory way.

ps. Did you consider a square version? Might be interesting with the

I haven't considered it yet. I think it works in Symple because
multiple placements compensate for the limited connectivity. In Yodd,
I'd say blocking would be too easy, but who knows?

On a square grid, if two pairs of groups, one of each color, are
competing for connection around the same area, it's likely that none
of them will succeed, whereas on a hex grid one side will always do,
at the expense of the other. The latter should be best for Yodd. What
do you think?
