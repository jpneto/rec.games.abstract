<br><blockquote type=cite>I had the same objection about themes being allowed.&nbsp; In my mind, not
<br>that I'm an authority on abstract games, but in my mind abstract games
<br>are best defined by what they don't have: no random elements, no
<br>hidden information (which would exclude simultaneous move games), and
<br>(I always thought) no theme.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Back when I used to belong to a junior chess club, for a short while
<br>(before it was discouraged as distracting from real chess) we played
<br>some Kriegspiel - at which I was much better (relatively speaking)
<br>than real chess. It's an interesting exercise trying to mate with e.g.
<br>king and rook against king playing Kriegspiel (can't recall if it's
<br>forced or not).
<br>
<br>Kriegspiel has hidden information, but it's odd to classify it as not
<br>an abstract game, when chess is.
<br>
<br>(I believe how we played - which was from a well-defined source - very
<br>slightly differed from the usual definition of the game in certain fine
<br>details. But everything fundamental was the same. Note that we
<br>aren't talking about the AH game of the same name.)
