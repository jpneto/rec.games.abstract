Mr. Steere, you are in VERY serious need of therapy or something.
This group is not your group at all.  It is not your playground, your
universe, and you are not the moderator.  Your anger at me needs to
stop.  There are reasons why I have tried to ignore you.  I am on
IGGameCenter and you bust into game I am playing there and yell out,
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IAGO?"  Seriously, WTF does it matter to
you?  But no, you have an axe to grind, and you won't let go of it.
For flat out, I am not in charge of IAGO now, so you have issues with
that, go there.  Well, you accomplished one thing, driving me out.
Why not give yourself a golf clap for something irrelevant.  Maybe you
can go urinate on the owners of Boardgame Geek in the name of IAGO and
mess up things even more.

Lastly, and I will say this one time to you, NOT EVERY SINGLE GAME IN
THE SERIES CLAIMS TO BE AN ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAME.  Whatever your
fricken problem is, get over it.  Seriously, GET OVER IT.  It is fine
to have a design approach that there are no draws in your game.  But
you take that attitude into life, I am sure you won't have too many
people you do get along with.

Anyhow, feel free to tell the current president of IAGO to take out a
hitman and shoot me if you feel I am THAT much of a terror when it
comes to abstract strategy games.  One thing, it is not me.  You know
the website, go and mail a complain there about me.  That might be the
single most productive thing you could do in regards to abstract
strategy games.  Because, as a closing note, in regards to yourself,
you are irrelevant to what I need to get done, and also I can flat out
say you are irrelevant to the advancement of games in general, and
abstract strategy games completely.

- Rich
