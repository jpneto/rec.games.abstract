Some questions:

Contra-cannon opening
:
: 1.  Che3   Cbe8
A very old opening variation indeed. More 'modern' variations of the
contra-cannon are:
 1.  Che3  Hg8
 2.  Hg3   Rh10
 3.  Rh1   Ch4
 4.  g5    Cbe8
The above variation is more 'flexible' as Black can always select
other openings at move #3.
Many books have been written on this contra-cannon opening.

: 2.  Hg3    Hc8
Other choice for Black is Hi8

: 3.  Rh1    Hg8
: 4.  g5     Rb10
Not a good choice by Red. Perhaps 4. Rh7 should pressure Black's horse
more.
: 5.  Hc3    Rb5
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Is 5... Rb4 trying to blockade Red pieces and/or pressure c-pawn better?
Or perhaps later ... Rb4, when 5... Rb5 seems waste of time?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
: 6.  Ei3    i6
Another weak reply by Red. Should have sacrifice the solider. Black
dares not take it because Black Horse on g file would be exposed:
 6.  Rb1   Rxg5
 7.  Ce2   Rh10
 8.  Cg2   Rd5
 9.  Ege3 and Red has a very good position.

Similarly, not a good move by Black's i6 . Probably did not foresee
7. Rh7

: 7.  Rh7    Hge9
Do not understand why Black has to sacrifice Cannon. Could have played
7.  ...    Ei8
8.  Rg7    Rg10 and then Hge9 to exchange the Rooks.


: 8.  Rxh8   g6
: 9.  Ca3    gx5
: 10. Rb1    Rxb1
: 11. Hxb1   g4
: 12. Hh1    Cxe4+
: 13. Ade2   c6
: 14. Hf2    Cxa4
Another disastrous move by Black. Did not calculate that Black's Horse
is unprotected when Cannon moves away from e file. Probably should have
consolidate its defence by 13. ...    Ege8.

What if black protects his cannon with 14... f4?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
: 15. Rxc8   Ea8
: 16. Cxa7   Rh10
: 17. Cb7    f4
: 18. Rxa8   e4
: 19. Cb10+  Hc10
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What about 19. Re8!! (threatens Cb10X) Exe8 (only move) 20. Cxe7 (pins black
horse and elephant) and 21. Cb8X. Too difficult to see over the board.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
: 20. Cxe7   Ge9
: A few minutes left...
: 21. Rxa4   Rh7
: 22. Ce5    Rb7
: 23. Cxd10  Rxb1
: 24. Cd6    Rxc1+
: 25. Ad1    d4
: 26. Ra7    c5
: 27. Re7+   Gd9
: 28. Rd7+   Ge9
: 29. Ce6+   Gf9
: 30. Rf7X   1-0

Red has won the game by move 13 due to sloppy play by Black. Perhaps
Xiangqi beginners should concentrate their opening just by using solely
the central cannon opening and ignoring other more subtle openings such as the
Elephant opening which requires very good middle and end-game skills.
