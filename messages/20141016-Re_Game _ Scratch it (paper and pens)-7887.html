It is a 2-players game.

A board 6*6 is filled randomly by 6 copies of 6 numbers from 1 to 6.

One number per square.

Player 1 choose one number k(1) in the board and scratch it.

Player 2 must scratch k(1) numbers under the condition that each next scratched square is adjacent (horizontaly or verticaly or diagonaly) to the scratched previous one.

Player 2 choose another non scratched number k(2) on the board and scratch it so player has to scratch under the same conditions above and so on.

The same process goes on until one player can not make a legal move.

Players can not scratch the same square twice.



The last one to make legal move wins the game.



Is there any strategy for one of the player to win?

Or is the game fair?



Thank you for any clue or comment.



The game could be played using pens and paper after printing a board filled with the 36 numbers randomly placed (doable using Excel or any spreadsheet).
