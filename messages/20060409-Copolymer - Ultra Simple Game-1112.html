Copolymer is an ultra simple game I came up with on April 5, 2006.
I've been play testing it for the past few days and it seems to be a
valid and most interesting game at this point.

COPOLYMER RULES:  Start with a honeycomb patterned board with an odd
number of cells, such as any size regular hexagonal board.  Each of two
players has a unique color felt pen or a unique color set of tokens.
Players take turns adding their tokens to the board, at least one token
per turn.  Players are not allowed to pass on their turn.  Define
"connection" here as the placement of one of your tokens adjacent
to two <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opposing<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> tokens (that is, adjacent to each of two or more of
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your opponent's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> tokens).  Having done so, you must add at least one
more token to the board while it is still your turn.  Your turn
concludes when you add a non-connecting token.  You are never required
to form a connection, unless the only available cells are connecting
cells for you.  Once the board fills up, the player who has claimed the
majority of cells wins.

NOTES:  There is a tendency in beginner play to maximize one's token
count on every turn, but it's usually best not to do that.  For
example, suppose on one of your turns you can claim a maximum of five
cells, and that doing so would enable your opponent to claim seven
cells.  Alternatively, if you only claim three cells (less than your
maximum possible), enabling your opponent to claim only two, such a
play might be more advantageous.

The influence of Dots and Boxes on Copolymer is apparent, but Copolymer
is different enough that personally I wouldn't call it a variant.
The central, defining characteristics of Dots and Boxes are the drawing
of connections and enclosures, the claiming of said enclosures, and
multiple move turns.  In Copolymer, the connections and enclosures
already exist, and the claiming of a cell doesn't always trigger the
addition of more tokens in the same turn.
