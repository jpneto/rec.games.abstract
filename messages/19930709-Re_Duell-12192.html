Here are the rules for Duell (From the instruction manual):

Duell: A game the users the ultimate weapon . . . the mind!

for 2 players

---

To Start
   Arrange the pieces as indicated on the board, (5 1 2 6 A 6 2 1 5).  Note
that all the 4's face inwards (towards your opponent).  Decide who goes first.

The Object
   To capture your opponent's key piece (A) OR to land your key piece on your
opponent's key space.

The Play
   On your turn, you must move ONE of your pieces by 'tumbling' it over one
space at a time.

Moving the Pieces
   1.  A piece must be tumbled the number of spaces indicated by the dots
showing the tope face at the start of the move.
   2.  A piece may move in any direction except diagonally.
   3.  A piece may move straight or make one 90 degree turn in a move.
   4.  A piece may not reverse directions on the same turn.
   5.  The key piece may move only ONE space per turn.
   6.  Pieces may not jump over other pieces.
   7.  Pieces may be lifted from the board only when captured.
   8.  Once a move is started, it must be completed with that piece.

To Capture
   An opponent's piece may be captured and removed from the board by landing on
it by exact count.

Playing Hints
   1.  It is sometimes possible to approach one square from two different
paths.
   2.  Your choice of path will determine what number will be on the "top face"
of your piece at the conclusion of the move.
   3.  Your strategy can include planning for subsequent moves if you can
control the "top face" and space locations.

The instructions then digress into a number of diagrams showing all possible
moves for each piece.

Good Luck!
