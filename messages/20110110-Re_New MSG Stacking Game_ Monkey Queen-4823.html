Minor tweak: I'm bumping up the initial stack size in Monkey Queen from 8 to
12.  During testing, playing against myself, I was playing ultra defensively
and didn't even realize it.  This will draw the game out and make it
artificially lengthy.  The first time I played against someone else, Greg
Van Patten, he charged out of the gate and played very aggressively.  It
didn't harm the game.  Just made it different.  And it also made us both run
out of checkers quicker.
