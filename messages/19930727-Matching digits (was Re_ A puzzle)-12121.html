[ Note that I am crossposting this to rec.games.abstract.  While this
  game does not fall under the letter of r.g.a's charter (being non-
  deterministic) it certainly is an abstract game subject to
  theoretical analysis.  Please followup to rec.puzzles, though. ]

A little over three weeks ago, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:rama@att.com">rama@att.com</a> (Ramakrishna Kandarpa)
posed a problem which I would rephrase:

  Two players, the chooser and the matcher, each pick a sequence of
  six decimal digits.  If the sequences share a pair of adjacent
  digits, the matcher wins; if not, the chooser wins.  Find optimal
  strategies and the probability of a match.

<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:stein@hal.nta.no">stein@hal.nta.no</a> (Stein Kulseth) noticed that the problem statement is
ambiguous, in that it is not stated whether an adjacent pair matches
its reversal, so there are two different games to analyze.

Stein correctly notes that if we count reversed matches, the chooser's
only pure undominated strategies are to pick any pair as his only
pair, by playing either XYXYXY for a heterogeneous pair or XXXXXX for
a homogeneous pair.  To prevent the matcher from taking advantage of
regularities in his play, the chooser should pick his pair uniformly
from the 55 possible pairs.  The matcher's pure undominated strategies
are to pick 5 different pairs.  As long as any of the 55 possible
pairs is equally likely to be used, he guarantees a 1/11 probability
of winning.  This analysis generalizes to sequences of any length of
digits in any radix.

If a heterogeneous pair does not match its reversal, the problem is
much harder.  Stein's very good analysis of the problem was marred by
two errors: a trivial mistake that caused him to get the wrong answer,
and a deep mistake that had no effect on the outcome!  The trivial
mistake was counting 90 pairs of digits (10 homogeneous pairs and 80
heterogeneous pairs) rather than 100 pairs of digits (10 homogeneous,
90 heterogeneous).  The deep mistake was to assume independence of
events that were correlated, in order to prove an inequality that
turns out to be satisfied anyway.

It is clear at first that the chooser's only undominated strategies
are to pick either six different digits, or a cycle of one to five
digits repeated as many times as necessary to fill out the sequence.
For if the chooser's sequence contains any digit twice,
     d[i] d[i+1] ... d[k] d[i]
the entire sequence may consist of d[i]...d[k] without any increased
exposure to matches.

Let us first analyze the game if the chooser's strategy is a
combination of the strategies C1=XXXXXX and C2=XYXYXY.  The matcher
should then avoid any sequence in which a heterogeneous pair and a its
reverse both appear.  It should be clear that this game is effectively
identical to the reverse-matching variant, since the chooser includes
the reverse of each pair.  The chooser should follow strategy C1 2/11
of the time and strategy C2 9/11 of the time, so that each homogeneous
pairs is chosen with the same frequency as each unordered
heterogeneous pair.  The matcher follows the same frequency, by
averaging 10/11 of a heterogeneous pair and 45/11 homogeneous pairs in
each sequence.  The probability of a match is 1/11.

Now suppose the chooser were to use one of strategies C3=XYZXYZ,
C4=XYZWXY, C5=XYZVWX, and C6=XYZUVW some fraction of the time.
Stein's important insight is to show that these increase the
probability of matching heterogeneous pairs above the probability of
C2 matching, no matter how many heterogeneous pairs the matcher picks.
Suppose the matcher picks N heterogeneous pairs.  Stein reasoned that
since the probability of one of the chooser's pairs fails to match one
of the matcher's is (1-N/90), the probability of three failing to
match is (1-N/90)^3, leading to a match probability of 1-(1-N/90)^3.
But the chooser's three pairs are not independent, so (1-N/90)^3 is
not the correct joint probability of failure to match.  I have
determined the correct probabilities by computer search, and they are
given in the following table.

N        Stein             XYZX            XYZW            XYX

2   5941/91125~.0652    1/16 =.0625    23/360 ~.0639   2/45~.0444 
3   2611/27000~.0967   11/120~.0917    95/1008~.0942   1/15~.0667
4    631/3375 ~.1275   29/240~.1208   313/2520~.1242   4/45~.0889
5    919/5832 ~.1576    3/20 =.15     155/1008~.1538   1/9 ~.1111

The table assumes that the chooser's sequence does not repeat any
digit except in homogeneous pairs; this can be done without impairing
the chooser's strategy against C1 and C2.  The "Stein" column has
Stein's incorrect lower bound on the match probability.  The "XYZX"
column has the correct match probability with strategy C3.  The "XYZW"
column has the correct match probability with three of the pairs in
strategies C4-C6.  The "XYX" column has the correct match probability
with strategy C2.  Note that although Stein's lower bound is not in
fact correct, the match probabilities for C3-C6 are still greater than
the match probability for C2.  Thus a competent chooser will never use
C3-C6, and the analysis with the chooser restricted to C1 and C2
applies to the unrestricted game as well.

I have done some preliminary investigation of the game with different
length of sequence and digits of different radix.  For radix 2 and 3 I
calculated complete tables of optimal strategies for chooser and
matcher in the following table (though I have not thoroughly checked
my case analysis).  For the chooser's strategy I only list the first
cycle.  The table ends when the matcher is able to achieve an
unavoidable match.

     Radix 2
Length Chooser           Matcher            Prob
  1    X                 any                0
  2    (1/2)XX+(1/2)XY   (1/2)XX+(1/2)XY    1/4
  3    XX                XXY                1/2
  4    any               XXYY               1

     Radix 3
Len  Chooser                 Matcher                                Prob
1 X                          any                                     0
2 (1/3)XX+(2/3)XYX           (1/3)XX+(2/3)XY                         1/9
3 (1/2)XX+(1/2)XYX           XXY                                     1/3
4 (1/2)XX+(1/2)XYX           (1/2)XXYY+(1/2)XXYZ                     1/2
5 (3/8)XX+(3/8)XYX+(1/4)XYZX (3/4)XXYYZ+(1/8)XXYYX+(1/8)XXYZY        5/8
6 (3/8)XX+(3/8)XYX+(1/4)XYZX (1/4)XXYYZZ+(1/4)XXYYZX+(1/2)XXYYZY     3/4
7 (3/8)XX+(3/8)XYX+(1/4)XYZX (1/4)XXYYZZX+(3/8)XXYYZZY+(3/8)XXYYZXZ  7/8
8 any                        XXYYZZX                                 1

The regularities in the radix 3 table and the piecewise linear
probability are most intriguing, and I wish I had time to construct
the radix 4 table.  I know only the following portion of that table:

      Radix 4
 Len  Chooser        Matcher               Prob
 1 X                 any                   0
 2 (1/4)XX+(3/4)XYX  (1/4)XX+(3/4)XY       1/16
 3 (2/5)XX+(3/5)XYX  (4/5)XXY+(1/5)XYZ     1/5
 4 (2/5)XX+(3/5)XYX  (1/5)XXYY+(4/5)XXYZ   3/10
..
14 any               WWXXWYYZZYXZWZ        1

I would be interested if anyone knows of or would like to investigate
further results on this game.
