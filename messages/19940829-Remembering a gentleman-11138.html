Jonathan Schaeffer gives me news that sadden me:

He died one or two years ago.  He was an interesting person.  He was
a detective with the FBI and apparently was involved with breaking
some major, well-known crimes.

I know his story all too well.  We corresponded some, then I visited him
at his lakeside home.  At Sanford, during my first checkers tournament
my wife and I joined him for breakfast and had an extensive conversation.
Years later a colleague turned out to be dating Scheidt's daughter and I
had a coonversation with her.  In fact I had a book with his picture 
when young and his mother.  Ed's daughter had never seen a picture of
her grandmother when younger, so I lent her the book.  She broke up
with my friend before I got it back (it was a price for sixth place in
the second division of the Illinois State Championship -- but it meant
more to her than me).

Scheidt had been head of the New York bureau of the FBI, and also head
of the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles.  Contrary to the
stereotype one might form, he was very much a liberal -- indeed his
wife could be called a socialist and Ed shared some of her views.
He was said to be the one who broke the Alger Hiss case, though he 
was personally opposed to his prosecution.  He always regretted his role
in the case.  I believe it was disagreements with J. Edgar Hoover over
surveillance of legitimate domestic leftist groups that led to his 
decision to quit the bureau.

The few times I met him I was under the distinct impression of being
in the presence of a true gentleman.  I know this will only interest
those members of the newsgroup who follow tournament checkers, but as 
you inform me of a death I had not heard of (but suspected given his age
and the amount of time since I had heard of him) I cannot help but
pause and offer my reminiscences of a gentleman, a great checkers
player and a friend.
