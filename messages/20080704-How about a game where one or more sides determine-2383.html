Check this thread out on the Chess Variant site.

The basic idea is to have a game of chess (or any abstract strategy
game) and at least one side (if not both sides) collectively votes on
what the move should be. In event of a tie for votes, the first
proposed tied move would be the move the side would make. During a
given time period, people are allowed to change their votes.

In a single player vs mode (Kasparov vs the World) you have a top
player take on the world, or a group, or like the Internet. In the
case of the Internet, people could use computers to come up with
moves.

Another approach is to have people join into a game as one side or
another and they would then have a rooting and voting interest in
their side winning. Both sides end up being voted upon.

Any comments here? We may have something that is doable.
