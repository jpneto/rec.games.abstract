I'm new to this list. I am interested in a certain type of abstract
game. Since I'm basically a gamer right now and can't consider myself
an abstract game enthusiast, I wasn't sure of some of the terminology
or available abstract games/sites from which to draw comparison. I
would a appreciate a link to the Newsgroup FAQ

AFAICT this group doesn't have a FAQ.  rec.games.board and
rec.games.nomic both do, but it doesn't sound like those would be
your cup of tea. :)

and maybe some links to
the sites most relevant to:

Abstract games which have no set turns (or turns limited by mandatory
playspace, like GO or tic-tac-toe)

Check out Icehouse.  I've never played it, but it doesn't have turns.
The only other turnless game I can think of off the top of my head is
one to which I can't find any references online -- it was created by
Sid Sackson, I think, and was very abstract -- one player was the
"Designer" or "Creator," who thought up a pattern of symbols on a grid,
and then the other players tried to guess the pattern by making as
few guesses as possible.  Since the players didn't need to interact
with anyone except the Designer, it was asynchronous.  For similar
turn-based games, cf. Mastermind and Zendo.
  Oh yeah, and some party games, like Pit.  Whether those count as
"abstract" enough for this group has to my knowledge never been
tested.

Pretty much any abstract spatial game IME can be extended to an
infinite playspace in several ways -- e.g., take Pente (connect-
five) and put it on an infinite grid.  Take Connect-Four and extend
the baseline to infinity in one or both directions.  Take Othello
and let the board grow to infinity -- maybe even let a player place
a "board edge" at the cost of a move?

Board games that have original abstract concepts. Uniques. TwixT is
another version of Tic Tac Toe in my eyes (connect opposing sides of a
board). Chess and Shogi (a bunch of pieces trying to attack a specific
piece). I thought Fortress America was much different than any other
game before, starting with 3:1 ratio, adding 1 sided growth and
guaranteed attrition.

Some common themes I can think of right now:
  Connect things (Hex, TwixT)
  Create shapes (Pente, Tic-Tac-Toe)
  Get a piece into a certain goal area (Breakthrough, Octi)
  Remove all opponent's pieces (Checkers, Othello)
  Remove all opponent's moves (Nim, Chess)
  Remove all your own pieces or moves (Uno, the other type of Nim)
  Collect certain sets (Fluxx [mostly], Pit)
  Determine a pattern (Zendo, Set)

Hmm... not terribly useful, but whatever.

Anyways, thanks for the read-thru and glad to meet you too!
