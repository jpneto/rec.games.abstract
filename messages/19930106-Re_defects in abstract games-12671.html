Interesting statement, but I doubt that it's defensible.

The complexity of R-P-S arises from psychology. In Go there are no perfect
players, so it is necessary to adapt strategy according to the understanding
of the other guy's personality and perceived technique.  For example, I'm
less inclined to make risky moves against someone who I believe has a
strong understanding of tesuji. Given the much greater range of effects
that psychology can bring into the game, how is R-P-S more complex or
challenging? I'm sure Chess players can make a similar case for their game.

|&gt; Trying to justify game preference logically is a futile proposal, and we
|&gt; can do without the psuedo-logic that comes from the attempt.

Within limits. Would you argue with the claim that Chess is objectively
better than 3x3 tic-tac-toe because the latter is well within (adult)
human capability for complete analysis, with no room for psychology?
