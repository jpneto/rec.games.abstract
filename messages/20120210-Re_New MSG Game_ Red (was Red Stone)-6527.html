Mark,

Although you may consider this a minor accomplishment, I
think it's actually pretty cool.

I was driving home at night, after a lovely two hour massage from an
ape strong Chinese lady (when she laughs, you laugh) trying to push
through a long standing roadblock - the filament game - something like
Tanbo but more restricted in form.  Different color "fill" stones were
used to fill in the places the filaments couldn't get to.  At some
point in the design evolution, I stumbled onto something like the
cancer kill function.  Pretty cool.  Then, defensive after years of
being brutalized on the Internet, I knew people's first complaint
would be that this was a subset of fucking Go.  Crap.  I just created
a fucking Go variant.  The roadblock still stands.

What the hell though.  I'll post the rules, it'll be completely
ignored, and that'll be the end of it.  Obviously that didn't happen.
I'm starting to warm up to the game though.  Once I created the
diagrams and played Luis, it started to dawn on me.  Yes, this is
actually pretty cool.

So it's a cool thing when a design choice improves both.
It's too early for me to level any verdict about Red, but the
the early signs suggest that you may have done that here.

That would be Luis' contribution.

p.s. I wish there were a different word to use in stead of
"architecture".  While I agree there needs to be a word
that stands for "balance, finitude, drawlessness, and
simplicity", "architecture" sounds 10x too pretentious.

I don't know why people are so irked by architecture.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I'm<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> starting
to get irked.  Architecture is a word I thought of long ago as the
closest fit to the art of abstract game design as I perceive it.  Not
just any architecture.  Bridge architecture.  A lovely, lovely
confluence where River Form meets River Function in a thundering gyre
of ingenuity.  Is it high falutin'?  Maybe so, but who the fuck else
can do what I do?  What you do?

College degrees don't mean shit in the world of abstract game design.
A long line of pedigreed gas bags have proved that right here in
rec.games.abstract.
