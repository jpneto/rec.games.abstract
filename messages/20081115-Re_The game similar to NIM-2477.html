I have to consider the following game:
all rules are the same like in classic 'nim' game except one rule -
the
number of stones in heaps are nondecreasing (e.g. (1,2,2,6,7), not
(5,1,7)). After every move this rule must be keep. So player can
remove stones from heap X only and only if in heap to the left are
less piles and he can't remove more stones, than difference between
heap X and heap to the left.

I'm pretty sure this is called "the silver dollar game" (or maybe "the
silver dollar game without the silver dollar" in <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>On Numbers and Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.
I'm pretty sure that a sequence of order-heaps h_1, h_2, ..., h_n acts
like a Nim game with heaps related to differences of adjacent h_i ,
that is
   h_n - h_(n-1),
   h_(n-2) - h_(n-3), ...,
   h_(4-(n mod 2)) - h_(3-(n mod 2)),
   h_(2-(n mod 2)) - h_(1-(n mod 2))
where h_0=0.  Basically, moving in order-heaps congruent to n (mod 2) is
like taking stones from a Nim heap, and moving in order-heaps NOT
congruent to n is like ADDING stones to a Nim heap, which can always be
answered by reversion (taking the stones back out by moving in the next
higher order-heap).

Reversion is a little iffy when we deal in the Lost World of mis¨¨re
games, since reverting the ending moves loses.  So there may be a
difference in the mis¨¨re Nim endgame.
