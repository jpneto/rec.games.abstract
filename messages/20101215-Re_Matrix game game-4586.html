There used to be people posting games of the recreational math variety
such as yours, too (Leroy Quet and Torben Mogensen to name a couple),
but not so much any longer. Reading the previous couple of threads
should make it clear why - they're mostly monologues by the guy who
just acted like an ass to you.

I suggest boardgamegeek's abstract forums. They're not perfect, but
Mark's de-facto banned from there, which makes them infinitely better
than here. recre.games.combinatorial is OK too, but I won't rule that
some people would rather get legalistic on your game being non-
combinatorial, than discuss it. (Sadly, self-styled abstract game
designers often have personality issues. Mark's not the only one,
though he's exhibit no. 1)
