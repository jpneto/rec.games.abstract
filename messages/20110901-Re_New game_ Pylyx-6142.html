Well, you're the one that brought up "any kind of pie" :) .

My question exactly ;-)

I'm wondering if one player can simply use herding techniques to force
one of the opponents pieces to become isolated. After that, there's no
incentive to let it go, and the game becomes infinite.

Adding the possibility of breaking up larger piles doesn't prevent
that.

Even adding a quite radical rule that every small-enough-to-move pile
must always be allowed to move doesn't fix it, as you'd try to herd a
piece into a bigger pen. And of course, topologically, surrounding an
immobile pile is equivalent to penning in every other piece on the
board.

So tactics would move towards avoiding being herded. So it's like
a game of just running away from threats, with less incentive to
actually achieve a winning position. It still sounds too infinite.

Yes, I agree, you may be right. Still I'm willing to await actual play
and since I have no opponent at hand, I'll wait for an applet.
Meanwhile I'll keep considering the 'generic herding' approach and the
problems you envision.
