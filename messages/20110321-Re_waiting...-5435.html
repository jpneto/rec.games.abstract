Good idea.  IRV is explained more clearly here:

Yep.  I think this is the best suggestion so far.  Thanks Luigi.  What do
you think, Daniel?  Less work for you and the judges, and accomplishes the
same objective, or so it would seem.

instant run off voting only gets one winner, you wanted a top 3.
also, everyone who is tied for last gets eliminated, not just 1, my
solution was just a fix to instant run off voting to handle only
having 5 judges

example
A-H are in a contest
Everyone chooses A as their top game.

Everyone else is eliminated, there is no top 3, only a top 1.

Second:  Judge 1-2 choose the following order
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D
5. E
6. F
7. G
8. H

Judge 3-4 choose the following order
1. C
2. B
3. A
4-8: D-H

Judge 5 chooses the following order
1.  H
2.  B
3.  A
4.  C
5-8 unimportant

according to simple run off voting, A would get first, C would get
2nd, H would get 3rd (since it was knocked off last), B would get
nothing, all because one judge liked H, even though everyone else
hated it.

Repeating run off voting (the first one i proposed) would have come to
the following conclusion:
1st all non ACH gets eliminated, H then gets eliminated rolling down
to A so that A wins.
Then a second round is instantly run with A not in the picture for
2nd:  2 votes for B 2 votes for C 1 vote for H, all others get
eliminated first, then H rolls down to B.  3 votes for B gets B 2nd

Rerun it with A&amp;B eliminated:
C 4 votes H 1, C gets 3rd.

Much more logical result given the choices.  1 judge doesn't have
instant win powers on his favourite, it has a tie break already in
place in case everyone has 1 vote for different games (where as simple
instant run off would have to have a revote), and it has something set
up when 1 game wins with 3-5 straight up votes, thus eliminating all
games with 0 votes simoltaniously without any chance to decide who was
2nd or 3rd.

i've run votes using instant run off on small population, this is by
far the most logical conclusion one can reach on how to adapt the
instant run off to work with only 5 votes
