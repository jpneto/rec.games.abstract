While I generally tend agree with the arguments you give in your refutation of the giants' shoulders metaphor, I must nevertheless give it some credit. I made Grand Chess on the basis of Chess because I was dissatisfied with its incompleteness as well as with Capablanca and Lasker's attempt to remedy this. I didn't find very difficult either, not after I saw the initial position and the implied free rooks. 
The step that was made from Shatranj to Chess was a visionary one, the more so because it used basically the same board and pieces. This, in retrospect, emerged as a truly giant step. 

Ljuban Dedic was a Yugoslavian Draughts master who succeeded in translating the structure of International Draughts to an orthogonal Draughts version that he christened 'Croda'. That was a brilliant step (maybe I should add "in my opinion" here). A characteristic feature of this modified version of Turkish Draughts was that movement was in part diagonal while all capture was only orthogonal. Thus he unknowingly handed me a game that would not lead to gridlock under 'linear movement'. Linear movement in a Draughts game was an idea I had laying on the shelf for some 15 years. Applying it to Croda was simple. I feel in this case one could say I was standing on the shoulders of a giant.

But I agree the metaphor isn't all that applicable in some cases where it is being used.

In mathematics field for example YOU HAVE to stand upon the shoulders of giants but not in game design. What you did with your Grand Chess is nothing more than some sort of improvement (I`m sorry I do not know Grand Chess even if I know lot of chess variants). Chess game itself no one knows who invented it. Common people are able to invent games. Put 10 peoples in jail give them the opportunity to create games by providing them everything they want and be sure that they will invent something very very very surprising. Inventing games DO NOT NEED prior knowledge. No giant is needed.
If you take any classical game known be sure that less than 10% of the possibilities of each game were explored until now.
You can not imagine one second how many improvements we could do. The problem is that people often are "enslaved" by some sort of belief that no noe could do better. "L`esprit se sclerose au contact d`un environnement dogmatise". The game community is unwittingly imposing some sort of unwritten rules that people are afraid to violate.
Erase all what was done and start from what you feel could be another starting point. 
The creativity must be like a big bang now that the computer could ease any desire of the game designers. Another game`s universe is ready to be created. But people are enslaved by the what-it-has-to-be-done imposed by the Ayatollahs of the game design.
Thank you for your comment.
