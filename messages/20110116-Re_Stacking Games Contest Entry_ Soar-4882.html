Posted this accidentally in the Jump Sturdy thread, so once again:

The Soar applet now allows for a swap. Introducing a swap is the only
tweak the game got, but the rather sloppy way in which the rules were
initially presented has undergone some improvement thanks to several
suggestions that came in. Thanks for that, I had written them down
off
the top of my head and the result was rather sloppy indeed. Hope
they're unambiguous now.
