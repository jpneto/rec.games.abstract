<br>&nbsp; (Define your terms. How do I play checkers "randomly"?&nbsp; Perhaps the

<br><blockquote type=cite>If just one player chooses to play randomly, then it becomes a sort of

<br>&nbsp; Nope. Suppose Alice plays randomly, while Bob is still trying to play
<br>the metagame. Alice isn't rewarded by her skill in <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>anything<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i>, since her
<br>job could easily be performed by a computer or some even simpler inanimate
<br>object (such as a six-sided die). I assert as an axiom the statement that 
inanimate objects have no "skills."
<br>&nbsp; Now, what about Bob? Is he rewarded by his skill in pattern matching?
<br>No. No matter how good Bob is at recognizing patterns, there aren't any
<br>patterns to Alice's play --- she's playing randomly. So Bob may have
<br>mad pattern-recognition skillz, but they avail him not. Once Alice starts
<br>playing randomly, Bob might as well throw "rock" every time --- the only
<br>reason he doesn't is because he secretly fears that Alice may still be
<br>playing the metagame. :) [1]

<br><blockquote type=cite>Not that any of this makes me think of it as a classy game.

<br>&nbsp; I'm sure the World Rock Paper Scissors Federation is working to change
<br>that popular perception. ;)

<br>[1] - Smiley, because Alice probably <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>would<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> start playing the metagame at
<br>that point, unless she'd wandered off and left her play to an inanimate 
object.
