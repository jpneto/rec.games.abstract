Thanks guys!

Mark: Flume does indeed look applicable on a number of counts;
composite moves, large branching factor and the immediate reward of
each move is not obvious. Would you say that the complexity of the
moves gives it low in clarity?

Christian: Yes MCTS is revolutionising AI for a lot of games, we might
be seeing a paradigm shift away from alpha-beta search.

Greg: Thanks I'll check out Cluster. UCT tends to play poorly in most
cases unless tweaked or enhanced with domain knowledge - do you think
this was more pronounced than usual with Cluster?

I've also wondered why there have been no publications on UCT for
Chess - that's usually the first game that AI researchers attack!
Presumably the results are not good, and the Chess AIs these days are
so good that there'd be no comparison. I guess the more subgoals or
strategies that a game requires to be played well, then the more
domain knowledge has to be incorporated if UCT is to work; perhaps I
should be looking at the distinction between tactical and strategic
games.
