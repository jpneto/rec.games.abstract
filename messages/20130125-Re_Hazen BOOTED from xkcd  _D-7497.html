When these "new game" threads first started appearing, I was a bit on the fence. They weren't puzzles, that much is certain, but there was some logical analysis that could be fruitfully engaged in, so, what the hell, I let it go.



Since then, there have been more than half a dozen topics about these games, and, what initially had some interest for logical analysis, now has very little. Having devolved into an argument over what constitutes plagiarism, I feel that this experiment has run its course.



So, new rule (or rather, a somewhat stricter enforcement of the old rules about what is and isn't suitable to be posted here)



No more abstract games or puzzles from Combinatorics123 [Monsieur Buffoon]. No more discussion in existing threads (I'll be locking them down now).

Where will you announce your "revolutionary" games now, Monsieur Buffoon?  I suppose you can still post them here [sigh] even though they're all either flawed, unoriginal, or totally pointless.  Some "revolution", lol



You came here to teach us "fake designers" something, Monsieur Buffoon.  Instead you treated us to the spectacle of your desperate, failed attempts to salvage your flawed games. 



Oh well.  Better luck in your next "revolutionary" endeavor, Monsieur Buffoon.  What a waste of a sperm cell.  You should have been aborted in a subway toilet.



Have fun at the mall, BOZO!!!!

I will send puzzles instead of abstract games.
The moderator has not enforced the rules that`s it.
He tolerates my first game Exasott because it was easy to implement.
Now Markrappy go there and post any of your games.
It will be removed not because it is a crappy (which is in my point of view) but beacuse it is an ABSTRACT GAME.
Do not try to fool poeple.
You are DUMB.
I have never seen someone too dumb.
Dumb and racist both are in harmony.
You did attack Christian Freeling as Deutsche Nestor as Spanish and so on.
I predict that you are going to be homeless in less than 2 years.
No home no money no wife that is your future.
