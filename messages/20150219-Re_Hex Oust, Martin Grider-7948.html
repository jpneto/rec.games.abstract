Martin Grider never finished my Hex Oust app.  I think I've put $1000 dollars into that, but I don't remember exactly.  Haven't heard from Martin in over a year.  I don't blame him though.  The AI portion was just too fuckin' hard, as I tried to convey at the outset.  But sometime people just have to learn the hard way.

So do not worry! You wil save 1000 dollars then.

Hi Martin,

I'm getting used to either being accused of 'owning' the CodeCup or being credited for things I had no idea of. In the last mail I got from Marcel Vlastuin, one of the organisers, he commented on the successful Ayu contest and informed me that for next year they had chosen an 'own' game (I'm not quite sure what he meant by that) about which they were quite enthusiastic. I had also sent him Pit of Pillars for consideration, and he informed me that it will be in the mix for the CodeCup to be held after the next one. I can't remember ever having mentioned Hex Oust, but I remember we discussed inventing abstract strategy games in general and Mark is one of a few a prominent inventors, so his name did pop up during that conversation. 

Of course I'm interested in how well the bots will manage Hex Oust. As was the case with Ayu and Symple, humans might prevail by a not too large margin. Comparisons are tricky because bots are not on their best (new games and a very limited time spam per game), but neither are humans.
