:-)  isn't that the case with any game? Take chess: if I don't do anything
stupid against Kasparov, I wouldn't lose either.
 
But in a way I share your opinion. Only I think that it is ignorance.
Abalone (again like chess) does have a workable strategies to play for a
win. It is only that I haven't found them yet.
 
Obvious strategies:
keep you marbles together; try to occupy the center; prevent that your
adversary does the same. Anything else?
 
But what about short term tactics? Is there more to it, than just to
play for tricks and errors of the opponent?
