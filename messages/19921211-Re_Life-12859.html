Conway suggested that a computer (Turing machine) could be
constructed in the Life world, and someone (I don't remember
who) later proved that he was right.  But the number of cells
required could be very, very large.

But I've never heard anyone suggest that some kind of actual,
living bacteria might reproduce according to the rules of
Conway's Life.  Bacteria just don't behave that way.
