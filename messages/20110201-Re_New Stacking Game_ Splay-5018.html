Greg, let me be the first to congratulate you on a beauty of a game
and a new twist in the relation between the height of a stack and
specific surrounding cells. In most games that feature this
relationship, stack height is linked to the number of adjacent cells
only (Explosion, Explocus, Crossfire, Trounce).

Your implementation is more organic and has a predecessor only in Mu.
Mu it is layered, explosions ('splaying' in your game) blow away the
top layer, then proceed on the bottom layer. A top-layer explosion
let's the layer vanish from the exploding cell and thus lowers the
number of neighbors of adjacent top-layer cells, giving rise to chain
reactions.

That mechanism, splaying affecting the number of vacant neighbours of
adjacent cells, works similarly and wonderfully in Splay. To keep the
reactions balanced, the rule of 'collapsing' stacks that have become
to high to splay is as simple as effective.
A very elegant and solid game, congrats :)

I played a few games of Splay and watched the computer play itself
once.  My criticism is that the game seems to lack dynamics.  Flags
are permanent, and so the game seems to be to be a lot of nibbling
around the edges of a locked-in structure and as the game goes on it
gets less interesting because more and more of the board becomes
inert.  I wonder if the game wouldn't be better with some kind of
ongoing mechanism to challenge control all over the board.

I haven't played it yet, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions on the
basis of what the computer makes of it. In tactical terms, causing
opponent's stacks to collapse seems quite dramatic. But it requires
careful strategy to get to a position to be able to execute it.

Flags may be permanent, but so are live groups in Go. Nevertheless I
see you may have a point, though I can't really tell yet how serious
the 'lack of dynamics' will turn out to be. It may well turn out to be
a matter of taste. All I said about Splay could have been said about
my own game Symple: elegant, intricate, solid, new. But Symple lacks
drama, possibly more so than Splay. It's like a big ship heeling
slowly one way or the other, and by the time you get a clear picture
of which way, it's too late to do much about it.

Games like that require a strategist who likes to look deep into the
opening arrangements to harvest small advantages in the end. And small
advantages yet win the game, in the end.- Hide quoted text -

First, thanks for all the comments/interest from everyone.

Being a new player of Splay myself, I am trying to gain a deeper
understanding of the game dynamics as well.  There seems to be a
significant component whereby advantage is gained by strategically
utilizing the current territorial landscape.  But there is more.  For
example, I'm beginning to find that there are "strategic building
blocks" whereby a player constructs clusters of nearby towers in a
vacant landscape and simultaneously develops them in a cooperative
"sum is greater than the parts" style.  This leads to greater control
over the developing landscape.  I have been able to get an early lead
against the computer by playing a trio of adjacent towers (I will post
a saved game file demonstrating this to the web page later today).

I wouldn't rely on the computer game to find these deep strategies
since the lookahead is limited (the game "ships" with a default of
only 3 second thinking time - it's user adjustable though).
Increasing the thinking time might help add more strategic variety,
but I haven't had enough time to experiment with that to say for sure
and the search depth involved in discovering the effect of splay'ing 3
connected towers is too far out for my computer game to "see" the
conclusion (25 ply to reach full development in the example I will
post).  Therefor, I suggest not becoming jaded by what the computer is
doing.  I realize there are both benefits and risks of announcing the
game along with a computer implementation.  The computer game can be
setup for face to face play and I also suggest playing face to face if
at all possible (not over the net right now - unless one uses the
forthcoming Zillion's version) .

I do believe there is much more to explore with the game.
