For those who have gotten hold of the ADI manual from the forums or by ftp
there is an updated improved text version I'd be happy to e-mail you.  For
those interested: the conceptual rules of ADI can be stated as follows: 
get as many groups of stones on the board as possible (reasonable limit on
group size of course), each group must have a liberty, can have unforseen
events through any random process (optional), keep placing stones until
placements would create groups larger than agreed to size, score by
counting the number of groups and subtracting a difference between the
totals of the stones of each style.  ADI uses the same board and stones as
GO.
