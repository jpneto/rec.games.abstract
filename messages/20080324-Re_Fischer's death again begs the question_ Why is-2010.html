I find it baffling that you are so absolutely
confident that grandmaster chess players would not
be able to adapt their chess to thrive in a world that

	I find it even more baffling that you think that is what I
think.  GMs <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>already<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> adapt to draw-unfriendly situations.  If you
are [or your team is] behind in a match, then you are under pressure
to win, and every draw is a nail in your coffin.  Similarly, if you
[say] need 2 out of 3 to gain a norm, or if you think that's what
you need to win a tournament, or for your team to avoid relegation.
Similarly if you are playing a weaker player, where you have to win
or get egg on your face.  If draws were worth only 0.4 or 0.3, it
wouldn't change those pressures, and it seems to me that it would
make precious little difference to how games were actually played.

	As usual, you are assuming that encouraging players to play
in a more murky style is "better chess".  We can all agree that the
12-move GM draw is bad for the image of the game;  but it doesn't
follow that playing for a small endgame advantage that you hope to
convert is worse chess than speculative sacrifices that may or may
not work.

	No-one is stopping you.  Persuade your local club to run its
championship by whatever scoring rules you like, and report back.
If everyone who tries it says "Great!  We had a draw-free tournament,
and it was much more fun", then it may spread.

The point is that in modern chess you cannot be successful

than two games. [...]
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

	Isn't that rather empirical evidence that you cannot be
successful if you lose a lot?  No surprise there, then.  Yes,
the tournament winners have wins and draws and occasional losses,
and the tail-end charlies have losses and draws and occasional
wins.  Even if draws only score 0.4, I'm confident that you will
still see that pattern, and what's more that you will still see
people winning long GM tournaments by establishing some early
wins and then cruising home by taking easy draws, or for that
matter by being content to draw against their near-peers and
being better than them at crunching the lower order.  Indeed,
it would likely increase the latter tendency, because losing to
a rival would have increased significance.

	You posed that proposition.  Who said anything about

	It does.  I freely admit that I have never tried to raise
millions for a WC-standard event, but I have played my part in
fund-raising at the local level, and we have always managed to
persuade companies and individuals to part with hard cash to
sponsor juniors or clubs, or to provide equipment, or to pay for
venues, etc.  Chess has a good image.  The shenanigans around
(a) post-1974 Fischer, (b) the split between FIDE and Kasparov,
and (c) "toiletgate" and similar have IMNSHO done <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>far<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> more to
