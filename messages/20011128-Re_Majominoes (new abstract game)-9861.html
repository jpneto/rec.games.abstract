1) Without O's double move, under perfect play the game would be a win for X
(regardless of the regions used).  Can you prove this?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Since draw is impossible and the game is deterministic, either X or O
can force a win. Note also that the order that the X's and O's are
placed make no difference for the final score. Assume O can force a
win. This means that any move X makes is followed by a move by O such
that the final result gives a higher score to O. Furthermore, the
placement of O's pieces is determined only by the position of the
already placed pieces (by X and O). X can now do the following: Place
the first piece anywhere on the board, then wait for O to make her
move. Now, X ignores his first piece and plays as if O started. He
will always respond to O's move by pretending O started and the first
X piece isn't there, unless this is the place that perfect play
suggests. In this case, he just places randomly and ignores this new
piece in the same way he previously ignored the first. Since the
assumption was that the second player can win regardless of what the
first player does, it doesn't matter that O has fewer choices than if
she played first, X can always find a perfect response. In the end,
X can make the board look like O started except that O can't place her
final stone since it is occupied by X on his last move. Hence, the
board will be the reverse of the board where O started except for one
piece being swapped in X's favour. Since that can't possibly hurt X's
score, he wins. Since we concluded that X wins from the assumption
that O wins, the assumption was incorrect and, hence, X is guaranteed
to win.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
2) Does allowing O a double move allow O to force a win on some boards?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes. Assume a 3x3 board where the regions coincide with the rows. No
matter where X places, O can place in the same column in the two other
rows. If X later places in one of the two rows that already has an O,
O does the same, winning this. Hence, O will definitely win two rows
and one column (taken in her first move). Since rows are also regions,
that gives her 5 regions. The total number of regions is 9, so she has
more than half.

I suspect the double move will actually allow O to win on all boards
for N&gt;=3, essentially by using it in her first move and hence turning
it into a game similar to the one in question 1 with her as first
player (and, hence, a winner in a perfect game). I can't quite factor
the two initial plays out of the proof, though, so I may be wrong.

3) Is there any advantage to O delaying the use of her double move?  In
other words, shouldn't she just always use it on her first turn?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If my assumption above is correct, she can always win by using it in
her first move, so there would be no advantage in waiting (if all we
care about is win/lose and not maximizing scores).

4) It is X's turn to move.  O has already used her double move.  Who wins?

Offhand, I'd say X, but I haven't done an exhaustive search.
