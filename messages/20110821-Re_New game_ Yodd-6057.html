At first, I considered having the opposite goal and was happy to name
it Splyt, but found that joining is more intuitive than splitting, and
that's what connection games are about in the first place. Of course,
with the right to place stones of both colors, the game is still
effectively the same.

Usually I don't like misere variants. They're logically sound but
getting rid of my men in Draughts somehow doesn't fit my emotional
involvement, nor does ending up with the smallest territory in
Reversi. Strategy of Draughts 'misere' is totally different from
regular Draughts. In Reversi I can't tell - I don't play either and
have no feeling for the games - but I can see how it might not be
altogether different in terms of strategy.

Here I can't figure out how different it would be, smallest number of
groups or largest. Intuitively I'd go for 'largest', but then you'd
have to split yourself and join the opponent instead of vice versa.

Both variants doubtlessly have intruiging strategies and my guess is:
fairly similar (more so than Draughts and its misere variants). Also,
neither is counterintuitive: split as most you can or join as most you
can.

It's a very clever concept in either case: a game with the option to
use both colors, that has an a priori degree of clarity, isn't all
that common. In Draughts for instance there are the "Stavropol"
variants where you may move both colors. They reduce me to a state of
acute schizophrenia. Yodd doen't seem to have that effect at all.

I agree with Mark that the name is very 'Burmish'. Whether this is a
good or a bad thing I can't tell, because he's one of the few
inventors with a reasonable commercial success, so the name probably
won't stand in the way of that :)

P.S. Yodd might be a hard nut to write a program for.
