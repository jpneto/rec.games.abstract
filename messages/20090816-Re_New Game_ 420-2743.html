I particularly like your 1-page game format which is exactly the
format I edit.
Games with simple materials, economic, for families, fast and free. :)

Well, thank you.  :)  It's nice to get some positive feedback,
especially in a discussion group not particularly known for its
magnanimity. Generic game playing equipment is ideal on a number of
levels, but the most compelling thing about it is that it's exactly
what I need.  Exquisite, fundamental game parts shaped by thousands of
years of evolution.  What proprietary plastic part could I manufacture
that would bear comparison with the Go stone?  Or the checker, or the
Mancala set?  What folly it would be to try.  The field of abstract
games is inundated with plastic balls, bridges, mushrooms, cock rings,
hair dryers . . .  Let's get back to the basics.
