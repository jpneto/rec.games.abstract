While I generally tend agree with the arguments you give in your refutation of the giants' shoulders metaphor, I must nevertheless give it some credit.. I made Grand Chess on the basis of Chess because I was dissatisfied with its incompleteness as well as with Capablanca and Lasker's attempt to remedy this. I didn't find very difficult either, not after I saw the initial position and the implied free rooks. 
The step that was made from Shatranj to Chess was a visionary one, the more so because it used basically the same board and pieces. This, in retrospect, emerged as a truly giant step. 

Ljuban Dedic was a Yugoslavian Draughts master who succeeded in translating the structure of International Draughts to an orthogonal Draughts version that he christened 'Croda'. That was a brilliant step (maybe I should add "in my opinion" here). A characteristic feature of this modified version of Turkish Draughts was that movement was in part diagonal while all capture was only orthogonal. Thus he unknowingly handed me a game that would not lead to gridlock under 'linear movement'. Linear movement in a Draughts game was an idea I had laying on the shelf for some 15 years. Applying it to Croda was simple. I feel in this case one could say I was standing on the shoulders of a giant.

But I agree the metaphor isn't all that applicable in some cases where it is being used.
