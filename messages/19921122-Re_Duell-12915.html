     Duell was played on an 8x9 board.  With each die starting in a specific
orientation.  You were only allowed to make one turn with a die (that might
be wrong, but that is how I played it.)  You could win by either capturing
the opponents king, or by landing on the starting square of your opponents
king.  The king could always only move 1.  Each side had 8 dice and a king
placed on the back row of the length 9 side.
