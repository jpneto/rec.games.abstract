I just had a thought.  Are there any such games?
Well maybe not on the order of thousands like 
Ultima, but how about a game that could 
accommodate 10 or 20 and yet be purely abstract. 
At the moment, the most I can think of is 6-bowl
Abalone.

-  Chinese Checkers.
-  Take It Easy:  This is a German game, that is an abstract but has a random
element:  Each player has a small board and matching set of hexagonal tiles
with colored (and numbered) lines drawn in each of  the three directions.  One
player randomly draws a tile, announces its numbers, and every one plays that
tile to their own board.  The object is to complete lines of the same color as
across the board.  Sets come with 8 boards, but multiple copies can be used for
more players. 
-  Ricochet Robot:  This a puzzle game any number can play.  The board is a
square grid with a few walls and symbols placed at strategic locations.  There
4 different color robots placed on the board.  A chip is drawn (another random
element), which matches the symbols on the board.  The object is to determine
how many moves it takes to move the same color robot to the symbol on the chip.
 The first player to spot a solution calls the number of moves he takes as a
bid and starts a timer,  Other players have 1 minute to find a better solution.
Really any number can play.
