Yahhh... don't keep us in the dark - who or what is Cathedral (the "defining 
rules &amp; pieces" bit makes it sound a bit like CE...)?

For those that do not know Cathedral, it is a game where two player attempt
to fit all of their pieces into a square playing field and prevent their
opponent from doing the same. There is a simple concept of territory (cf
Go). The game's name derives from the fact that there is a distinguished
neutral piece, the Cathedral, that is placed by the first player as his/her
first move.

For those who know Cathedral, is the game too easy for the second player
(ie the one who gets first move after placement of the Cathedral) ?

Is it possibly a forced win for player 2 ?  Everyone I have persuaded to
play me cannot stop me winning as player 2, but then again I often win
playing first so that is perhaps more an indication of my opponents'
skills.


Cheers,
Michael.
