Monkey Queen rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Monkey_Queen_rules.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Monkey_Queen_rules.html</a>

It occurred to me that architecture wouldn't win the rec.games.abstract
stacking game contest.  Gameplay would.  Do what every other designer does.
Focus on gameplay.  Hence Monkey Queen is my first gameplay-centric design.
What does that mean specifically?  The primary design imperative was quality
of play.  I play tested scenarios while designing, including different
opening setups.

In fact I didn't think the original rule set was substantial enough to even
function as a game, but I forced myself to play test it anyway, just as an
exercise - a starting point.  Turns out it was playable and I liked it, but
not enough.  So, in the spirit of conventional design wisdom... I tweaked
it.  I decreed that a queen can either give birth or kill but not both in
one move.  Play tested it some more.  Perfect.

If I get credible complaints about Monkey Queen's gameplay, I guess I lose
extra hard since good gameplay was my precise goal, instead of my usual
motivation, good architecture.  In the end though, my design process for
Monkey Queen didn't stray too far from my norm.  The architecture is
certainly there.  For example, you'll get roughly around 70 moves from 16
checkers on an 8x8 board.  Remarkable.

There was more play testing in Monkey Queen's design than usual, but still
not a heck of a lot.  The game probably has no more chance of being liked
than had I not play tested it, something I will continue to not do with my
future designs.

Monkey Queen has stalemates!  I really went against my own grain there. 
First, the stalemate adds an extra rule to the game, one not necessary for
the game to function.  Second, it's not just any rule, but one that allows
for draws in what should be a finite-conclusive game.  Not to mention that
the stalemate necessitated a more complex rule sheet.

A few reasons for allowing stalemates in Monkey Queen:
  1) Throw off my own reins against ever designing a game with draws, though
  endless move cycles are still unthinkable.  I've wanted a game with
  limited draw potential for some time, but there just hasn't been a safe
  opportunity.  I.e., one where I was pretty sure the draw rate would have
  no chance of spiraling out of control.
  2) Even though there's plenty of bloodshed throughout Monkey Queen's play,
  the conclusion seems a tad more civilized when you win by moving to
  checkmate your opponent's queen, rather than slaughtering it.  Once you
  adopt that perspective, you can't allow a queen to move into check, even
  if that's the only type of move it has available.
  3) The potential for a stalemate may add a little intrigue and richness to
  the game in the rare cases where such an opportunity might arise.  A
  stalemate will always occur near what would be the end of the game anyway,
  I believe.  You couldn't reasonably aim for a stalemate from the outset, I
  don't think.  The stalemate option could change a boring, waiting-to-die,
  end game scenario into the type of harrowing-escape-from-death that draw
  lovers are always ballyhooing.
  4) Last, not least, and maybe even most, the Monkey Queen stalemate is a
  tribute to Chess.  No, not a tribute to snotball Chess lifestylers, but a
  tribute to the game itself.  Chess belongs to everyone, not just the
  snotball Chess lifestylers who will invariably pooh pooh Monkey Queen
  sight unseen because it isn't Chess.

Moving on.  One can move a stack of like-colored checkers in a Chess
queen-like manner to an unoccupied square in Monkey Queen, leaving the
bottom checker behind on the originating square, rendering the stack one
checker shorter.  This is so reminiscent of Christian Freeling's recently
released Monkey Trap, where monkeys leave a coconut behind during a queen's
move, that I had to pay tribute somehow.  After clearing the name with
Christian, I hereby introduce Monkey Queen into the family of primate themed
games.

Like most abstract game designers, I generally find themes annoying.  But
themes don't really hurt anything.  In this case the theme fits like a glove
and it was there for the asking.  It makes the rules easier to understand. 
For example, a queen wouldn't be expected to kill an enemy baby while giving
birth to her own baby.  Wouldn't make sense.

Monkey Queen was a particularly satisfying design because, not only is it my
favorite stacking game now, it also solved a particular problem. "What if
I'm someplace where there's a Checkers set and I want to demo an MSG game?"
Extremely unlikely scenario but one I endlessly dwell on anyway.

I could always demo Mad Bishops since it's got the easiest rule set, but the
wow factor isn't there.  Like, "Wow, a bunch of bishops wiping each other
out.  So what?"  Dipole is an excellent game but it's also a serious game
and it's hard for a lot of people to grasp.  Not a real crowd pleaser. 
Enter the Monkey.  Easy to understand, fun, should be played seriously but
doesn't have to be, cool concept, etc.  Kind of the "Oust" of my stacking
games, or so it seems thus far.

One other satisfying note:  I've always wanted to design a
king-and-uniform-army game, especially with a checkmate involved.  Design
efforts to that end never succeeded before Monkey Queen.  It's queens
instead of kings, but close enough.

I'm lucky to have come up with anything in time for the contest.  I was
feeling burned out after all the work I put into Rive which then got a
lukewarm reception.  I needed a break more than anything else but, because
of the contest, I kept a board within reach and grudgingly nudged at the
pieces every day in a self fulfilling prophecy of helplessness... until I
finally stumbled onto the Monkey.

In spite of all the prior checker fumbling, Monkey Queen was a purely
cerebral design.  A few days passed between the time I thought of the
prototype rule set and when I moved the first stack in play testing it.  I
thought of Monkey Queen, immediately dismissed it as non-feasible, moved on
to other, more complicated notions which ended up not panning out, and then
reluctantly revisited the Monkey.  I'm really glad I did.

Added bonus: I already considered the rec.games.abstract stacking game
contest a huge success since it led to a congregation of world class
abstract game designers here for the first time ever.  For years the group
was overrun with posers, pseudo-intellectuals and sundry deadbeats.  Now the
relevant are breathing new life into rec.games.abstract, against all odds. 
The old guard is still having a little trouble shoving off and making way
for the new guard, but all in due time I suppose.

Anyway, I'm really glad I can submit an entry to the contest.  I don't have
any goal of winning, just participating, for which I needed a decent game.
