lol, Is this for the imaginary readership who didn't witness you ripping
Christian's game to shreds?  Etc., etc., etc., for the past few weeks?

I'm all for truces, Corey, but it was agreed upon in the context of you
saying you were "getting out" and then later considering making game related
posts here.  Not in the context of you coming back two days later to make
ridiculous, self-serving claims in rec.games.abstract.

It's not too late for the truce, as far as I'm concerned, but it needs to be
extended to all respected members of the abstract games community, including
most notably Christian Freeling.  Tone it down.

Personally, I think you got off easy, Corey.  I don't know how, but I
suspect Christian could have done worse.  Monkey Trap represents restraint
on Christian's part, not excess.

Corey is not all that uncommon.  In the apartment building I used to live in
before I moved into a house there was a guy named Corey.  His wife was kinda
hot but they moved away.  My point being that your incarceration in a monkey
trap is only an issue because you're making it an issue.  Nobody would even
think twice about it.  "Ha ha.  Bills and Coreys leaving turds behind in a
harmless, light hearted children's game."  Not "Let's see...  Christian is
ridiculing Corey, therefore I need to blacklist all games designed by people
named Corey."
