An applet could solve much of the initial 'visual dexterity' problems and in time it might become natural in over the board games. Come to think of it, there's a class of games where over the board play encounters difficulties that either don't exist or can be easily remedied using an applet. Here it may enhance clarity, in Stapeldammen it eliminates the need for manual dexterity, in Symple it highlights legal multiple placements, there must be quite a list of games that in the past would not have had a chance because of these 'over the board' complications. 

Thus Stapeldammen always seemed to morph into Jenga ;-)

Of course Jenga is more or less the reverse, although an applet might be funny if you managed to get it to work.
