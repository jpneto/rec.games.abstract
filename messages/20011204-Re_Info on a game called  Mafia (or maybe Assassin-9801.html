You need at least 8 players (10-12 is ideal).
One person is the moderator.  While everyone closes their eyes, the
moderator selects two mafia members, one sheriff, and one guardian
angel.  Everyone else is just a townsperson.  You know who you are,
but not who anyone else is.  Each round starts with everyone closing
thier eyes.  The mafia then open their eyes and silently agree on
someone to kill.  the sheriff then opens his eyes and has one chance
to finger a mafia member.  The moderator will nod yes or no.  The
guardian angel then wakes up and has one chance to 'save' someone he
thinks might have been killed.  Then everyone wakes up, the moderator
announces who was killed (or saved), and the accusations fly. 
Townspeople can vote off suspected mafia members, but they may end up
voting off their own kind.  If both mafia members are voted off the
townspeople win, if the mafia manage to last until the end of the game
they win.

I'm just looking for rule variations, alternate names, etc. so I can
do a little web research.  Anyone?

This game seems very popular with Germans (who call it "mafia").  You
might try a German-language newsgroup, if you can read German.
