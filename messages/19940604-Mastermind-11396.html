At least eight people responded to my query about Mastermind.  By
request, here is a summary of what I found out.

Yes, Knuth has a paper on it, as does somebody else, apparently in the
mid 1970's.  Two different "optimal" strategies are known: It's
possible to always guess in at most 5 guesses, using one strategy.
Another "optimal" strategy may take up to (rarely) six guesses, but
has a lower average number of guesses, (near 4.5) unless the Hider is
cheating.

I was given references to:  Math Reviews, the Journal of Recreational
Mathematics, and to Scientific American, in the columns, "Mathematical
Gamer" and Dewdney's "Computer Recreations".

Also, I've been told that 1 black and 1 white peg indeed allows for
the greatest number of possible valid combinations.

My computer implementation was written for an AI class, and wasn't
intended as an exhaustive study of the game.  It used an alpha-beta
pruning algorithm with ply-limited minimax search.  It works, but I
have almost never tested it using 6 positions and 4 colors (too slow,
given the language (Scheme) and, probably, some gross inefficiencies
in my code.  Mostly I have worked with 4 positions and 3 colors.)  I'm
also not satisfied with my heuristic, which is supposed to give a
value of how "good" the board is for the Guesser at any point.

Thanks to all who responded.

Steve
