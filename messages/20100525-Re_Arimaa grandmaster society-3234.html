Thomas,

Mark is a very theoretically-oriented due who designs from first
principles, and from that point of view, superko rules are icky.  But
he's not a player and has a hard time seeing things from that point of
view.  Also, the only way to deal with the ad hominem attacks is to
drop the thread.

Nick, please don't join a discussion that's already ended and call for
an end to the discussion.  It wasn't about superko or ickiness.  It
was about a lying Thomas using the zero draw rate at the Arimaa server
to "prove" his claim that Arimaa is ultra resistant to draws.
Remember the "We have seen occasional positions that tended toward
stalemate and piece shuffling [in Arimaa]..."?  The statement that led
to lying Thomas' masterful Three Card Monte performance?  Oh, that's
right.  You haven't read the preceding discussion.

Once again, the Arimaa server draw rate is zero *because the server
enforces superko*, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not because Arimaa is ultra resistant to draws<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, a
claim that remains unsubstantiated.

I was bamboozled by the lying Thomas, not that that's hard to do.
Fizzy wasn't fooled for one second though.  Good job fizzy.  Refuters
1, Bullshitters 0.

Do you guys understand what ad hominem means?  The statement "Thomas
lied to the group about Arimaa, and therefore he's a lying Thomas and
an idiot," is not ad hominem.  Acknowledging someone's idiocy doesn't
constitute ad hominem, Nick.
