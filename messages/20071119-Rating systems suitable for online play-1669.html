Most online competitive boardgaming sites use some variant of Elo
rating for comparing player skill. But it seems to me it has a number
of problems, which become especially serious in online play:

1. In online play, you can usually play a ranked game anytime you have
a willing opponent, and you can always refuse a ranked game. As I
understand it, federations aren't that liberal, and for good reason:
It becomes easy to score by playing the metagame well instead of the
game. Never play against an underrated opponent, and if you are
overrated yourself (which would be the goal of the metagame!), you
must be very, very picky, and only play people even more overrated
than yourself.

2. Even without such gaming of the system, it becomes much more
chaotic than conventional ratings, because playing patterns are non-
random. Likely you play more with people you know, and more with
people in the same time zone. In an extreme example, suppose you only
play one other player, and he's the best on the site. You lose every
game. Now you could in reality be the second best player on the site,
but you will quickly look like the worst in the ratings. Now you may
even find that others won't play against you, because after the first
match they notice how severely underrated you are!
In general, clustering distorts rankings. If there are two clusters,
whose members only plays against people in their own group (this can
easily happen if players are separated by language as well as time
zone!), there just is no way to compare people's skills cross-clusters
accurately.

3. To make matters even worse, there are robot players. The thing
about robot players is that they are predictable, and they can often
make rankings non-commutative: If player A can beat robot B, and it in
turn can beat player C, it does not follow that A can beat C. In most
games there exist some forms of anti-bot tactics, and knowledge of
these is a skill that can be independent of overall skill
(particularly against bad bots).

My claim is that Elo-type systems are inadequate for online rankings.
They are created for a very different environment, and even in those
they have problems, which become especially severe in online play.

But to get constructive here: There's no reason we have to rely on
these systems. For practical reasons, they don't make use of the
player's past history, except as summed up into a single number. But
we have much more computing power at our fingertips than Elo could
have dreamed about in 1960. Especially for online play, it's pointless
not to use it. It should be possible to get much better approximations
of player skill by developing algorithms that take the whole graph
into account - with each player as a node, and each possible pairing
as an edge in the graph, with weights according to the number of games
played, how old said games are, etc. A player's rating (and the
uncertainty associated with it) could be computed from a player's
whole history of games, considered individually.

It might even be possible to design systems with incentives for
recruitement and training of new players.

I am not a mathematician, so I'm not the right person to develop a
robust graph-based ranking system. But I can give an example of a very
simple one, to give an idea how they might work:

Construct a n * n matrix, where n is the number of players in the
system: One row and one column for each player. The element (i,j) of
the matrix is player i's win ratio against player j (0.5 if they've
never played). Now, (if I remember my linear algebra correctly!!) you
can look upon this as the transition matrix of a markov chain, and by
repeated multiplication of an initial vector by this matrix, you end
up with a vector that is a guess of the player's skills.

There exists very efficient algorithms for calculating such a vector,
so it should scale very well.

Any suggestions? Do you think this is a good idea?
