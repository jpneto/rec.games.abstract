I noticed that on the "ItsYourTurn" website there's a game called Black Hole
Reversi where one square is blocked off as nonexistent before the game begins. 
I wonder if it might not be more interesting to give each player a fixed number
of "holes", perhaps one, two, or three each, to be played anywhere on the board
as a turn.  Notice that holes would be immune to the "must flip" rule and could
be placed freely.  Has anyone tried this, and if so, does it make a good game? 
It might go a long way toward opening Reversi theory back up -- from what I
understand, the 8x8 game is becoming too narrow at the highest levels.  Does
anyone want to try an experimental game or two of "Hole Reversi" with me?

I think this would not as much open up Othello 
opening theory as it would totally F it up! :-)
