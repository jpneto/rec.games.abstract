Next, does anyone know of any companies which sell some of the
less widespred games? You know, someplace where I could maybe get
a Kalah board, or maybe Nine Men's Morris?

There is a book put out by the Klutz press (they also market
do-it-yourself juggling books) that has rules and boards for 15 games,
including mancala, go, backgammon, checkers, hex, 9 men's morris, 3d
tic tac toe, a fox and hound variant, Brax, Fandango, roundabouts, Cat
&amp; Dog (I'm pretty sure they made this one up), as well as several
others I can't remember. Some of the names may be made up - I'm not
sure. It comes with playing counters (35 or 36 of black and white
each), and 2 dice.  It's about $22 (canadian), but a real deal,
considering all the games in it. If anyone is interested, I can get
more info. It'd be in the chidren's section of a bookstore, because
some of the games (like go) are simplified.
