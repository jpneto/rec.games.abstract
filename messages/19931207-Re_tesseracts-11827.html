ok, i talked with one of my more mathematically inclined friends tonight and
we decided it was easier to consider each node of the hypercube as a room, 
as opposed to my original idea of each edge of the hypercube being one wall
of a given room.
we came up with the following arrangement, presuming you number the nodes
arbitrarily from 1 to 16 and conside the edges between the nodes as the 
passages between the nodes.  
 1 maps to 2,3,4,9
 2 maps to 1,6,7,10
 3 maps to 1,5,7,11
 4 maps to 1,5,6,12
 5 maps to 4,3,8,13
 6 maps to 4,2,8,14
 7 maps to 3,2,8,15
 8 maps to 5,6,7,16
and 9-16 are symmetric to 1-8
can anyone verify if this is correct?  
thanks,

The standard hypercube w/cubes as rooms gives the following arrangement:
           ___
          |   |
          | 6 |
          |___|
          |   |
          | 5 |
 ___   ___|___|___   ___
|   | |   |   |   | |   |
| 7 | | 2 | 3 | 4 | | 8 |
|___| |___|___|___| |___|
 in       |   |      in
front     | 1 |     back
          |___|

connections - (cube) to (t,l,r,f,back,bot), as they're facing now (t for one
may be l for another, though):
             1 to 3,2,4,7,8,6
             2 to 5,6,3,7,8,1
             3 to 5,2,4,7,8,1
             4 to 5,3,6,7,8,1
             5 to 6,2,4,7,8,3
             6 to 1,2,4,7,8,5
             7 to 5,2,4,6,3,1
             8 to 5,2,4,3,6,1

You "fold" the cubes around 3 so their tops all connect to 5, and their
bottoms all connect to 1, and their sides connect to each other (2-&gt;7-&gt;4-&gt;8);
this leaves one face on each cube but 3, each of which connects to 6, which
is forced to turn "inside-out" around them... Notice that orientation may suffer
if you make trips between two rooms on different paths - you may end up walking
on the "wall" or "ceiling". You may want to slide cutouts around a cube for a
bit to see this.

See Heinlein's "And He Built A Crooked House..." for more details (except
that his central room's windows should have looked into other rooms...)

Your idea of using the nodes as rooms gives you the "dual" of the hypercube;
the analogue in three dimensions is a cube &lt;-&gt; an octohedron. I don't think
much has been written in non-puzzle literature about this (you might try
parallel computing books), and I'm not gonna try verifying your notation :-).
