Abstract strategy games, are a subset of boardgames, so when you
attempt to define and list what is involved with them, you end up also
producing a taxonomy chart for all abstract strategy games.  By doing
this, you then can reduce what is or is not relevant to whether a game
is abstract or not.  This observation you made is a side-effect.

No, it's not a "side-effect".  Peter Clinch made a perfectly valid
point, a point which I was only seconding, and which you still seem
not to have grasped.  Your document starts with this:

So, abstract strategy games don't involve pieces and boards?  Come on
Mark, you can't define an abstract strategy game without defining it
as a boardgame.  Why do you want to remove this?  It is fine to expand
it, but to remove it?  Let's get real here.

"[Key elements]
There are multiple key elements that define all abstract strategy

Then everything in the document that follows this lead-in is a general
description of games, with nothing specifically about abstract games,
which totally doesn't make sense.  When you start out with a promise
to list the key elements of abstract games then presumably there will
be at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>something<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> in the document specifically pertaining to
abstract games which there isn't.  To dismiss this point as a "side

More needs to be done with it, particularly in the introduction (which

The world at large isn't going to run off with your document and
bastardize it.  This is just the most well known place where people
come to discuss abstract games.  Here you'll get more and better
feedback than in the IAGO forums which hardly anyone visits.

It is currently set up with a Wiki entry there.  Fine, people can log
on the site and change the Wiki entry if they like.  The introduction
is going to need to be expanded, as is here:

. . . bound what IAGO covers to go as far as including backgammon and
Kriegspiel, which do fall in the boundaries of what is acceptable.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I disagree with this.  I've only heard of Backgammon being excluded as
an abstract game because of its random element of dice.  I've never
heard of it being included as an abstract game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The issues are whether or not perfect information and a randomizer of
any sort should be included.  I knock backgammon out of the box, then
there will be complaints about it.  And then that would also mean that
you knock Kriegspiel out.   Do you think you will get an overwhelming
majority that would approve of Kriegspiel not being there?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The name of the organization is IAGO and should therefore concern
itself with abstract games.  That would indicate following commonly
accepted definitions and would preclude inventing your own definitions
such as "an abstract game can include random elements or hidden
information but not both".  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> heard that before you made it
up.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

When trying to allow for backgammon and kriegspiel, there needs to be
some boundaries laid down.  There is now the Fortuna category to
handle these two games, cases of a randomizer at the start of the
turn, and also hidden information.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The two primary, completely objective criteria for determining what an
abstract game is are:
1) No random elements.
2) No hidden information.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You have just eliminated Kriegspiel there.  Kriegspiel is a valid
chess variant.  Exactly what organization will cover it?  And as
Christopher Dearlove said, "Kriegspiel has hidden information, but
it's odd to classify it as not
an abstract game, when chess is."  It is also on the chess variant
website:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.com/incinf.dir/kriegspiel.html">http://www.chessvariants.com/incinf.dir/kriegspiel.html</a>

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In what's proving to be a difficult search for objectivity, these two
criteria are like diamonds.  When you take the liberty of combining
these two criteria in a mutually exclusive manner, you smash these two
diamonds with a hammer.

Why don't we preserve the integrity of the two diamonds and exclude
all games with random elements and all games with hidden information.
So we lose Backgammon.  So what?  Who gives a shit?  Everyone I've
heard of doesn't consider it to be an abstract game anyway.  So we
lose Kriegspiel.  Again, who really gives a shit?  We still have
hundreds of abstract games to deal with besides Backgammon and
Kriegspiel.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The reason why you care about both is that backgammon has more people
playing it that just about all the other abstract modern strategy
games you want to have as part of IAGO combined.  It is abstract in
nature and a strategy game, and is about to hit a tipping point.
Boardgame Geek classifies it as an abstract strategy game also.  Games
100 also have voted Backgammon variants on their Games 100 list.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Here's the beauty of keeping these two objective criteria intact:
They knock out all designer games, all war games, all german games,
Carcasonne, Puerto Rico, Night of Dracula, and every game that has a
stack of shuffled action cards or character cards or whatever kinds of
cards there are.  Do you see the beauty in that, Rich?  Now we have a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely objective<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> means of excluding thousands of games that
don't belong.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What I can argue here as a compromise spot is that backgammon fits in
as the exception to the rule in the classic games, and is the only
game with rolling of dice allowed in IAGO.  Also, the world's earliest
version of chess, Chaturang, involves the rolling of dice to determine
what pieces to move.  It is on the chess variants website also:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/historic.dir/chaturang4.html">http://www.chessvariants.org/historic.dir/chaturang4.html</a>

Also chess, prior to advent of the modern queen, had people playing
around with a use of a die to determine which pieces move.

While it is great to try to knock everything out in one swoop, it ends
up not accurately reflecting what is there and excludes some major
games.  What you can do is have the Fortuna category I added be just
for the classics, with Kriegspiel and Backgammon as the only two games
in there.  Perhaps have minor variants on other chess games.  And cap
it off.  The category is just for classics and not modern/standard.
This is a compromise position I can live with.  The Fortuna category
isn't expected to be played by a lot of people, but should help out
here.

And the problem is that you rule out games that most people would
consider abstract strategy games, such as backgammon...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, no.  I've only seen Backgammon described as not being an
abstract game because of the dice.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

And you are off.  When Boardgame Geek, Funagain, and a list of other
sites and people, quantify backgammon as an abstract strategy game,
then you can't just say no to it.

One thing that will look to come out of all this and the association
is a master list of abstract strategy games from all over the web,
which will act as a resource.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A master list is kind of like a master race.  It's not real
encouraging to those who aren't in it.  I can see the rational for
including games which have achieved some degree of popularity but this
excludes new games, such as Oust, which hardly anyone knows about.
You're not likely to cast a positive vote for a game you never heard
of.  This is not encouraging to designers who are hoping IAGO will
popularize their games, not just accept their games after they've
taken years to become popular with other means.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The master list is supposed to be the include all list of all abstract
strategy games out there.  It is meant to be inclusive of all games by
the definition.  Your desire to not have one means what?  IAGO isn't
going to have tournaments at all?  The latest state of the master list
is to be a master reference to all abstract strategy games that have
URL links on the Internet, as is the latest incarnation:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/iago-abstracts-list">http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/iago-abstracts-list</a>

That list is far from complete at this point, but contains a bunch of
games from Boardgame Geek, World of Abstracts and other places.

And here is one document that looked at the subject, siding closer to
what you believe: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml">http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml</a>
