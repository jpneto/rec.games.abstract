I would suggest that if I could come up with an algorithm that would

This seems wrong on two counts:

1. The game might be a win for Black (although this seems unlikely).
2. If you demonstrate a forced draw for White, that still leaves unknown
   whether the game is a win for White or a draw for White.

1. Yes. I had thought there was a proof by counter-example, but as I am unable
to find it, I concede this point.

2. That is a stronger 'solution' than the one I posited. I posited a solution
that essentially makes the computer invincible, rather than one that wins
if possible. For example, even if the game is a forced draw, it is likely
that different strategies might be chosen that would allow the opponent to
fail more easily. I have an "art of war" approach to solutions. If you
can guarantee not to be beaten, that's good enough. I accept that that
may not
be the best solution for all though.
