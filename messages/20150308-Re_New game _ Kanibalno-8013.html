Name game : Kanibalno

Kanibalno is an abstract game for 2 players based on new capturing system.

Goal : capture all of your opponent tokens to win

Material 

Squared board : 6*6
36 tokens : 18 red 18 blue
Each set of 18 tokens is composed by 6 copies of tokens numbered from 1 to 3.

Setup :
At the setup all 36 tokens are placed randomly

Rules :
Choose who play first 
Blue start the game and then players take their turn alternatively

On his turn a player :
- move one of his token without capture
- or move to capture one of his opponent token

Moves :

Only orthogonal move is allowed (horizontaly or verticaly)
Token are moved like chess rook
No jump is allowed
No passing turn is allowed

Capture :

Capture is allowed only if the token to be captured has a different value than the capturor token.
Examples : 
1 can capture 2 or 3 but never 1
2 can capture 1 or 3 but never 2
3 can capture 2 or 1 but never 3

Only opponent tokens can be captured
No multicapture is allowed
Capturing is not mandatory

The game ends when one of the 2 players has no token to move. 
The winner is the one who annihilated his opponent.

This sounds like a nice simple checkers variant, and should work just fine. But why the change from a non-capturing rook move to a non-capturing wazir move?

How would you categorize it? I admit to not playing a lot of the kinds of abstracts, but it seems to me that it could be most properly categorized as a type of checkers variant with a paper-scissors-rock type of capturing mechanism. 

As for the game play, I lean more toward Mark's first thought that some positions in random set-ups could favor one side but the game is complex enough so that seems like a low probability. (If you completely believed this couldn't happen, you wouldn't need the initial placement phase for expert players, because that would only prevent a random favoring of one side by replacing it with a contest of placement where both sides struggle to get an advantage in initial board position. The only problem there is that could allow a noticeable first player placement advantage.) 

But I'm curious why you reduced the non-capturing move to one step. It seems to me that limitation would be somewhat detrimental to the player who made a non-capturing move on top of the detriment of no capture in that turn..

Easy to understand why.
Assume that at the end of the game the player A (blue) has 3 remaining tokens numbered 1 and the player B (red) has only one token numbered 1.
If you rule the move as rook then no one will win. It will be draw. Because 1 can NOT capture 1.
But if you rule 1 square move without capture then player A will be able to block player B in the corner. Hence player A could win the game by making any move of his opponent impossible.
You are talking about Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanism. It is not the case because 1 can capture 2 and 2 can capture 1. There is a huge difference.
I have invented a familiy of games BUILT on RPS (rockpaperscissors) with n &gt; 3. From siltaire games to multiplayer games.
I will post them one day if I feel the need to do it.
Anyway there are 100`s capture mechanisms unexploited and unused.
What is really interesting in this game Kanibalno is that it needs long time to be mastered.
Try to produce a huge number of random setups and try to analyze if one of them will give an advantage to one of the players. YOU WILL NOT FIND IT!!!
Once the board is half cleared by captures then the game become very interesting. Each move will have huge consequences and the playgame will be more strategic as it goes to the end.
