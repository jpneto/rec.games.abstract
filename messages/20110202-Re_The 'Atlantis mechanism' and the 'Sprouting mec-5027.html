That would set the stage for infinite cycles.  To me, the beauty of Monkey
Queen is the subtle finite mechanism at its core.  Anything that compromises
the game's finitude demolishes it in my eyes.

One thing I did briefly consider though is allowing babies to move away from
the enemy queen when blocking a check.  I thought that might create the
potential for infinite cycles and it would certainly make the rule sheet
longer, but I was too lazy to look into it.  Nice thing though is it would
also make the game tree bigger.  Gotta love that - if it doesn't destroy the
finitude, that is.

Still, said rule would make the game more complicated to learn.  You'd get
all these asinine questions - "So, what has priority: moving toward the
enemy queen or blocking check or...."  I don't know if said rule would add
so much to the game that it would be justified, assuming it even works, once
again.
