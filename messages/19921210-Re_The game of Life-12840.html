anybody out there know about the game of life?  it's sort of a computer
simulation thing.  i dont recall much of the specifics, and that's why i am
posting this.  it was something like a piece could stay alive if it was
adjacent to 2 or three other pieces, and there were rules for new pieces
being born.  if anybody out there knows the rules, i would appreciate it if
you could mail them to me.

Ah, Life, by John Conway. Excellent, intriguing, fantastically complex game,
with simple rules. They go like this:

The game is played on an infinite grid. Each cell has eight neighbors.
Each cell is designated as either "alive" or "empty".

1) A living cell with exactly one or zero living neighbors dies of
   isolation.

2) A living cell with four or more living neighbors dies of overcrowding.

3) An empty cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive.

Some interesting formations:

               X                  X
                X             X    X
              XXX              XXXXX

            GLIDER           SPACESHIP

The glider traves diagonally one cell per four generations. The spaceship
traves horizontally one cell per two generations.
