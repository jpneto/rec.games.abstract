No, simultaneous movement isn't "perfect information".  But it is far

If the random events have a finite number of possible outcomes with rational

there is an equivalent game without (expilicit) randoness that uses
simultaneous moves to generate the same effects.

Untrue, because there is an element of psychology in simultaneous move games
that is absent in random mechanisms.  By your hypothesis, rock-paper-scissors
is equivalent to throwing dice to see who will be high-roller, and it isn't.

   No, that's not what he said. I got it backwards at first, too, but then
I stopped to think about his example. He said, in effect:

     You can simulate a die roll with simultaneous movement.

I think David understood what I meant. I think his argument about the games
not being identical is reasonable. I just think the effects are small in
practice and in the ideal case there is a real equivalence under an appropiate
definition of equvalence. However, in the ideal case you are going to be
using ideal randomizers, which brings you back to rolling dice.

This depends on your assumptions. If you can calculate what the optimal
stratgies are (in RPS its obvious what it should be because of symmetry)
than you can decide to assume that both players are using the optimal
strategy for that part of the game and roll dice to see what happens.
But you could easily lose an interesting part of the game if it isn't
obvious what the optimal strategies are (especially if the situations
are dynamic and can't easily be precalculated).

   This theorem was I think introduced in this thread to counter the idea 
(a straw man nobody's really arguing, IMHO) that, say, Snakes &amp; Ladders
could be <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>superior<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> to a game with no explicit randomness but with
simultaneous movement; because you can rewrite the rules of Snakes &amp;
Ladders, using simultaneous movement to determine each die roll, and
you'll get an equivalent game with no explicit randomness.

My point was actually the converse. It was to counter the categoric
'simove games are superior to games with random elements' statement. I felt
there was an implied 'all' before simove (but maybe I misread that) and wanted
to point out this didn't really make sense, as in some sense random games are
a subset of simove games, so there needs to be more said about why some simove
games are better than others (equivalent to games with randomizers).
