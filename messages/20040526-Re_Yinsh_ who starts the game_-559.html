Hi Michael,

&lt;&lt; In the rules to Yinsh it says the white player begins placing his rings
first, then the black player, alternating, until they've placed five. After
both have place their rings the rules (section D) say "you have determined the
starting position."
Then the rules continue on concerning how to move. But I never could find who
makes the first move after both players have placed their five rings. I assume
its the white player, but I'd like confirmation. Could someone specify the rule
that answers this? I would have thought the logical place would have been in
sections C or D. &gt;&gt;

In section E, it shows an example of a move, with a white marker being placed
in a white ring.  I expect that example was intentional, as the first move
after the pieces have been set up, and that your assumption is correct.

There is nothing in the rules about determining who goes first after the pieces
have been set up.  It has already been determined.

Harvey
