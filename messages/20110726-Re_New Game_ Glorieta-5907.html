I'm not quite sure about the division that will occur between a player

initiating opponent didn't achieve it.

Right. This is the big question for this version. I included the game
of chicken here because the version of the game without it (ie the
version where you keep playing neutrals until someone makes a loop)
feels over-tactical to me, in the realm of say, go-moku.  The neutrals
are powerful and as they build up they swiftly bring the game to a
close. It typically ends for me around move 8.  That's short.  Since
my motivation for focusing on this objective was to realize the
potential I saw for strategy, I didn't bother to mention this
version.

However, perhaps I shouldn't dismiss it quite as readily as I have,
because it looks like good play will stretch it out some, and in any
case there are people who like tactics-dominated games. Maybe I'll add
it to the post.

The game played without neutral stones tends to a tie (an
understatement really). Your use of neutral stones steers away from
that. Continuous use would fill the board up with half neutral stones,
and a quarter of both black and orange. Hard to imagine how a loop
could be avoided.

I believe a loop is inevitable, but haven't yet constructed a proof.

If he/she will do so when the chances of success are 50/50, then a
similar division might result between games won by making a loop and
games in which no loop has been achieved.
This is not counting loops achieved not by the initiating player, but
by his/her opponent. So having say two thirds of the games decided by
an actual loop would be a nice outcome, I feel.

My reasoning is similar, though I'm not sure how confident I am in
it.  And I don't have enough games under my belt to have developed a
feel.

Sidenote: I haven't ruled out the need for a pie rule in the chicken
variant, so that may be added at a later date.

You're pretty good at this Nick, a pleasure to see you 'at work' :)

Thanks. Slowly learning how to do it :)
