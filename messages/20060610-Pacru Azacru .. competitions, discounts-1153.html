Recently given the dubious distiction of being called an "osbcure gem" 
(which seems hard when the latest set was only published late 2005), you can 
play Pacru &amp; Azacru at (free) Manchester, UK open competitions in July and 
(not free) the Mind Sports Olympics in London in late August, and planning 
for Ann Arbor USA at U-Con in November 2006.

Pacru 302 is not cheap (but then you are getting a family of 3 genuinely 
different games) but you can get it very heavily discounted by playing it 
on-line (on-line play is free) or offering your pronunciation of Pacru, 
Shacru &amp; Azacru.   Or you can get it free by practising on-line and winning 
a set at one of the competitions.    See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pacru.com">http://www.pacru.com</a> for details.

We have also added a section on what the games are like, comparisions with 
other abstract games.  We welcome additional information or views on such 
comparisions so freel free to contact us on that.
