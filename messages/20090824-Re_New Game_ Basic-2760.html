You guys both seem to be responding to something that wasn't written,
at least not by me.  Allow me to repeat what I did say:

"The design objective was to construct the largest possible game tree
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>using Checkers equipment<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> (emphasis newly added)."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Even if we compare the game to others that use just checkers
equipment, I still think we're likely to find many games with
considerably bigger game tree.  Lines of Action comes to mind, as well
as checkers variants and stacking games that allow backward movement.
I don't know enough about these checkers-based games to say whether
there are others that satisfy your "ergonomic constraint" in addition
to topping your game's tree.  Maybe one of Christian Freeling's
checkers-like games?  The ergonomic constraint definitely makes it
harder.
