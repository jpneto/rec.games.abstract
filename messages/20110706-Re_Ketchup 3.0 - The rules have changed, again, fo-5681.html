Christian, can you see how your statement might seem

Well if I'm right then shut the fuck up with this "perfect" Sygo shit!!  I

Yes it does.  You're absolutely incapable of mentioning Sygo without
including some form of the word "perfect".  You're always condescending to
me about my commitment to outstanding architecture, yet you're so desperate
to have a game with outstanding architecture that you've convinced yourself
you have one.  You don't.

Is everyone who fails to recognize Sygo's greatness dishonest, or is this
something special just for me?  You ripped apart Rive and Cage recently. 
Does this make you dishonest?  No.  It just makes you vindictive and
childish.  I complained about one of your games so you have to complain
about two of mine.

What makes you dishonest, Christian, is your constant allusion to Sygo's
"perfection".  Nothing is perfect in abstract games - least of all Sygo.

Got it.  Sygo is the helicopter of abstract games.  Do you ever get tired of
hearing yourself yammer on about Sygo?

Oh yeah, and you're just a barrel of monkeys, Christian.  Everyone who
