Regarding the game that Wijnand Engelkes posted...

I came up with a similar poker variant [this is why it's off-topic] to that
game about a year ago.

Each player antes 100 units.  Players are dealt two cards each, face up.
The goal is to make the best five card poker hand.

The dealer then turns over the next card, and players commence bidding, in
normal play order.  Each player makes his bid by adding some units to he
pot.  The next player must either match and raise, or get out of the
auction.  The player who bids the most gets the card, to add to his hand
(face up).  Bidding is capped at 100 units.

The key factor is that if you bid on a card but don't get it, you still lose
your money.

If no one bids on a card, no one gets it.

Once a player has five cards in his hand, he can't bid on subsequent cards.
The last player gets his last card for one unit, but he must take the first
card offered (this keeps him from just choosing the best card remaining in
the deck).
