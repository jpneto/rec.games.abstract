Thanks for the post and the link to the Zillions download.

After playing the game several times, I cautiously conclude that the
rebels have a winning advantage.  At the beginning of the game, they
scatter from the general, cutting their losses.  Then they patiently
maneuver until the general has his back against the privy.  Then they
sacrifice a few pieces, enabling them to either force the general 
into
the privy or trap him on an adjoining corner.  Is this your 
experience
with the game?

Hunt games are notoriously difficult to balance.  Some of the larger
and more complex Tafl games may do an O.K. job of it, but I don't 
know
of a really first-class, well-balanced hunt game.  But perhaps 
someone
else does?

Yes, it seems the rebels are winning, but it isn't trivial. Of course, 
hunt games should be unbalanced, that's the point. If one cannot prove 
a win for the party with the weak pieces, then the game is useless and 
forfeited. However, it is better the more difficult it is. Asian 
leopard games aren't easy, at least not the bhigger ones. Pulijudam is 
very popular in India.
