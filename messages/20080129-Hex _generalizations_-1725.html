I keep seeing the term "generalization of Hex" bandied about to
describe variants of Hex and families of variants of Hex.  Most
recently in Board Game News:

"Mark Steere has designed . . . Atoll and Begird . . . [which] are
generalized forms of the games Hex and Y. . . . Have other designers
already covered this territory?"

"Eric, . . . Nick Bentley's Mind Ninja is another stone placement game
which is a generalization of a number of designs, including Hex and
Y."

"Good call, Larry. . . . Mind Ninja actually encompasses Atoll..."

There is only one generalization of Hex: Atoll.  Atoll is a precisely
defined, infinite set of games all of whose members share the central,
defining, geometric principals of Hex: The goal is to connect opposite
segments, and on a filled board you have exactly one winner.  In the
special case of Atoll in which the set member has the least allowable
number of perimeter segments, four, Atoll is exactly equivalent to
Hex.

Mind Ninja is certainly a variation of Hex, or a family of variations
of Hex.  I don't mean to impugn Mind Ninja.  I'm sure it's a wonderful
game, having been created by the talented designer Nick Bentley.  But
it's not a generalization of Hex, or Atoll, or anything else that I'm
aware of.  It certainly doesn't "encompass" Atoll.

Beyond that, Atoll is not a variant of Hex.  Atoll is a superset of
Hex.  Hexwiki recently categorized Atoll as a variant of Hex.  It
isn't.  Atoll is the natural connection game for even segmented,
hexagonally tessellated boards.  Hex is merely one member of the set
precisely defined by Atoll.  A set is not a variant of one of its
members.
