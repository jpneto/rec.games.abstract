Yes and no.  Yes, I'm a bit of a "spoiled brad", lol   "Fowwow suit" :D  No, my dad hasn't failed to recognize my intellect.  It was apparent when I was wee.  Both my parents are highly intelligent, so it wasn't a huge surprise with me.

There's been interest and speculation about Dad over the years, so allow me to elucidate.  Dad's a very generous man.  He's given hundreds of millions of dollars to charities, hospitals, etc.  If you're taken to any major hospital in NYC, tell them you're a personal friend of the Steeres and they'll bump you to the head of the line.

Dad's also been generous with us kids.  He's only 15 years older than the oldest of us, so he decided to bequeath us part of our inheritance while we're still young enough to enjoy it.  What were we supposed to do, turn it down? lol

I too give money to charities, though on a much smaller scale.  I also frequently hand out $20 bills to homeless people.  Even the fakers.  That's how I roll.  Speaking of rolling, when you see my Mercedes CLS 63 roll up on you in your rearview, move your beat up old jalopy out of the way.  You're blocking progress.  Btw, I also bought my wife a brand new Mercedes last year, and sometimes we cruise the highways together in a mini, Mercedes caravan.  Again, when you see us roll up, move the fuck out of the way.

True there's resentment from the unwashed 99% like Corey, but there's also a flip side.  People sense you're rich, especially when they see your 7.5 karat diamond ring and your fat billfold.  Often they treat you with reverence.  Young girls look at you with love in their eyes.  They aren't scheming..  They just want to suck your dick.  Of course now that I'm married, that doesn't do me any good.  But I still treasure the goodwill I experience every day.  For instance, I was at a movie theater ticket window recently.  The young hottie behind the counter said "Nice wallet" with a huge grin and lovesick eyes.  I looked at my tattered wallet, somewhat puzzled, and she clarified, "What's in it."  "Oh!" I exclaimed, before dashing off, chuckling to myself.

There aren't a lot of 99 percenters in my neighborhood, so I'm never subjected to their nauseating self pity in real life.  Just here on the Internet, which can be accessed by any greaseball with a library pass.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Wrong on both counts.  I have a great relationship with my dad, and I have enough of my own money to support a very comfortable lifestyle indefinitely..  I don't need any more money, though it's always appreciated because it's a nice gesture.  Occasionally, because I'm a "spoiled brad", I feel like it's not enough.  But before you know it, I get inundated with more generosity and it's all better :)
