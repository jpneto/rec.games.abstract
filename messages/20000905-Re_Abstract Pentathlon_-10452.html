Why not just make it a decathlon, and nominate 5 of each like Clark did?
:-)

Don't they do something along these lines in the Mind Sports Olympiad?  How
do they handle it?

A counter-proposal.

Each player nominates their 5 different games , in an order of their
choosing; all selections are made known to all competitors well before
the start of the tournament.

In each match, the two players play two games; one of each of their
selections.  The player who didn't choose a specified game chooses
whether to play first or second.

It might be worth publishing the full draw in advance as well, so
players know what games they need to study :)

If players aren't comfortable with the idea of draws, have each match
play three games, with the third being the selection of the organisers.

TTFN,
