OK, so maybe I went a bit overboard on my complaint, and I apologize if I
stepped on any toes. So what if this chess book or that go book is a bit
enthusiastic for my tastes? I may occasionally get annoyed, but I guess I can
deal with it. And you're right on another point; Bruce Becker's
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Backgammon_for_Blood<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is a wonderful book on that game, a classic even 25

!? <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Backgammon  for Blood<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is so bad that it is believed Bruce Becker was a
pseudonym of an expert who wanted to weaken the pigeons. I guess it is
entertaining, though. See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+346">http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+346</a> for a
relatively mild review. In a different context, Gary Wong wrote, "I see criticisms
of (for instance) Becker's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Backgammon For Blood<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to the point of 'if your
opponent mentions having read this book, double immediately.'"

I admit that I enjoy learning new games and coming up with strategies for them
on my own, more so than I enjoy replaying the same games over and over for
years. There are tons of great newer games that don't get the recognition they
deserve, and tournament play is a great way to expose them. Even so, I can
enjoy, or at least relearn to enjoy the classic games for what they are, and
remember that what others write about them doesn't change the game or make it
any less than it is. But I also think that marketers need to be a little more
careful, or at least more truthful in their advertising claims, not just in
games, but in all product lines.

Games' values are mostly subjective and they usually don't kill people, so
"exuberance" seem more appropriate than for, say, cars or drugs.

There is a larger issue: Some people are good at nontrivial games they have played
only a few times and some people aren't. Some people are willing to spend the time
to study tomes on games they couldn't write, others are not, or are unable to gain
enough.

One thing that bugs me about new games and variants is that the level of play may
be shallow just because people have not understood the game yet. (Oh, wait! Rule
172 says you just lost.) I rarely play variants unless there is some reason to
feel that ideas in the original carry over, but are warped in an interesting
fashion. If you make a game canonical then there is the chance for the
collaboration of many game players to produce real depth.

Maybe I'm biased, but the result of all this is that in a pentathlon of
abstract games, I would still favor more newer games than older ones. How about
3 to 2?

What tradeoff do you want between showing intermediate ability in many games
versus mastery of one or two?
