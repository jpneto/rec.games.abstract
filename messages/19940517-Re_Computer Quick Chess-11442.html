Does anyone know if there is a computer version of Quick Chess exists?
Barney Pell's METAGAME could certainly play it, but as I currently don't
have access to Prolog I can't use it (don't know how strong a player it
would be, either).

This is the first time is see this.

For those who don't know, Quick Chess is played on a 5x6 board.
No castling, no initial 2-space pawn moves allowed.  The initial
setup looks like this:

        6 r b k q n
        5 p p p p p
        4 - - - - -
        3 - - - - -
        2 P P P P P
        1 R B K Q N
          a b c d e

Any decent program should be quite strong at this.

Yeah, i agree:

Even the chance that a programm will play the best
move is considerably greater as in chess.

If you have a move generator for this game in C ( also
Pascal or even Assembler would be fine ), 
then it is even easy to adjust my
programm to this kind of board.
 
The boardroom is not that big as a chessboard.
There are only 
6 possibilities after first 2 ply.
after 1. c3,c4 there are only 13 possibilities.
Probably the average of of possibilities is even less.
Even a bad programm could have a factor of 3^depth, 
to calculate brute force.


If thousands of humans would play this game, maybe there
is a chance that someone could beat the computer.
