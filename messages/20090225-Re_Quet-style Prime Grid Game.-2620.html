Some time ago I invented a mathematical dart/board game which

So it was a good idea, early in the game, to aim for the 20
sector, which has 19 and 17 alongside, so that if one were
a merely passable dart player one could hit one of those and
keep it, being prime.  Rather than risk going on and destroying
it down to a 3 or even 2 !

19 and 17 are alongside 3. 20 has 5 and 1 alongside.

However, the main point of this post is to mention a possible
transfer of the idea to a pure abstract game.  My previous
attempts at this, tested with my regular opponent, proved
rather failures, though playable.

The Basic Game
==============
Played on a 5x5 grid, the players alternately fill any grid cell
with a number from the set {1,2,3,...,29,30}.  The numbers
are on their own discs, so each one can only be used once.
(The 5 left-over numbers are discarded unscored.)

Scoring:  Each row and column is added up, and the score for that
"""""""   row/column is the highest prime factor of the total.

A scores the rows, and B the columns.  Best total of 5 wins.

I'd want to play first (and last). Did you see a noticable bias?
