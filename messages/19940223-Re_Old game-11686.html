|&gt; &gt;There was this game that my math teacher used to play with us in junior high
|&gt; &gt;school. Actually she didn't really play it with us because we didn't know
|&gt; &gt;how to. Apparently the whole point of the game was to figure out what the
|&gt; &gt;rules were.
|&gt; 
|&gt; &gt;I think it was called Petals Around the Rose, and it involved two dice. The 
|&gt; &gt;only clue she ever gave us was "The name of the game is the key to the game,
|&gt; &gt;and the key to the game is the name of the game." If you know what I'm talking
|&gt; &gt;about, please let me know (email is fine) because it's been bugging the hell
|&gt; &gt;out of me since 8th grade.
|&gt; 
|&gt; &gt;Thanks!
|&gt; 
|&gt; &gt;Michelle.

|&gt; This sounds like "Polar bears around the ice hole". Teacher rolls some
|&gt; dice ( it doesn't have to be just two) and then announces
|&gt; "There are &lt;x&gt; petals around the rose/bears around the ice hole".
|&gt; 
|&gt; The pupils have to figure out the rule that generated the number x from
|&gt; the numbers showing on the dice.  The answer for this game is that a 
|&gt; dot in the centre of the dice face is a rose (or ice hole), and x counts
|&gt; the number of dots in the corners around it (petals or bears, depending).

The game of "Polar bears around the ice hole" is known in germany too and there
is even the extension of fish under the ice: the number on the opposite face of
the dice (which is not visible) is the number of fishes under the ice. However
I'm not shure if this makes any sense with petals and roses.
