Christian hasn't placed a lot of emphasis on originality throughout his career, but he's amassed an impressive portfolio of games nonetheless by making modifications to classics.  No shame in that.  A few years ago, in a misguided attempt to compete directly with me, Christian invented an original, finite game.  And it's <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>terrible<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  Symple launched Christian into a death spiral of denial, in which he continues to promote it as a "great game" year after year.

Abouricha, or whatever your name really is, I had hope for you as a designer for some odd reason.  I thought I "saw something".  Now I believe it was just a mirage.  Couple of problems.  You lack courage, you lack integrity, and you've clearly got a screw loose.

I looked at your Exasott link and the programmer is Alex Hammel, obviously another one of your innumerable aliases (A.H.) since nobody but you would program your plagiarized Exasott.  What's with all the aliases?  Who are you hiding from?  Nobody cares who you are.  There's no reason to hide.

You first compared Cephalopod to "Dice by Ludicton" in a desperate attempt to prove my unoriginality.  Boy, you made a bad selection for that purpose.  There are few games more original than Cephalopod.  Then, apparently realizing your folly, you now equate Cephalopod to Go, simply because they both employ placement capture.  You're grasping at straws, A.H. - making a desperate, psychotic case that I, like you, am totally unoriginal.  You can't stand the fact that I'm a successful designer and you're not, so you've created an alternate reality in which we're both equally inept.  You are the only inept one in the group, A.H.  That's your hallmark.  Ineptitude.

Your whole existence is trying to impress everyone, and you're failing miserably.  We're supposed to believe that you're highly creative and talented and successful in other fields?  What a load of shit.  If you're so talented, then with all your efforts you'd have created a decent game by now.  But you haven't.  We're supposed to believe that in the future, you'll show us all how great you are.  Doesn't seem likely.  Actions speak louder than words, and your existing inventions speak of ineptitude. 

You've issued final goodbyes more times than drama queen, Christian Freeling.  You have no credibility.  No integrity.  Without integrity, you'll never make it, A.H.  Never.

You're in your late 30's, living at home with your parents who have to put up with your ongoing temper tantrums.  They're trying to figure out some way how to make you man up, get a job, and move the fuck out.  Who do you think you're fooling?  Nobody here takes you the least bit seriously and they never will.  That's your reality, A.H.  Wake up and smell the coffee.
