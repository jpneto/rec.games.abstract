Thanks for the feedback Ed. The game that Mark describes is Star as it was
described in an article in Games magazine in 1983. *Star  (note the
asterisk) is a new game descended from Star as described on the  Official
Apocryphal History  page ( <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://ea.ea.home.mindspring.com/history.html">http://ea.ea.home.mindspring.com/history.html</a> )
of my web site. The scoring is similar but different. Just so reading the
History page doesn't confuse you even more, I must point out that there are
at least three ways of scoring which look very different, and two of them
played a significant role in the history.

The rules definitely need some figures as you suggest. And I notice that the
key concept of "sparks" is not discussed when the scoring is described. The
rules may be "logically" correct, but they leave something to be desired in
clarity. I will make them clearer. Thanks again for the feedback.

Greetings,

I'm a big fan of abstract games and I'm interested in this one.  I've
taken the time to read your description of the rules (and Mark
Thompson's description at his site) and I'm still not sure I fully
understand them.

You could do the Internet community a big favor by posting them with
step-by-step examples, using images for clarity.  I'm sure I'm not the
only one who is a little confused.


It looks like a great game.

Ed
