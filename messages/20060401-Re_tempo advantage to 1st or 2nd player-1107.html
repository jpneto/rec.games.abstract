<br>&nbsp; has there been any research on 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...?&nbsp; it isnt
<br>&nbsp; clear to me was the progressive chess tempo advantage is.&nbsp; if
<br>&nbsp; just count the cumulative moves, it goes 1-0, 1-2, 4-2, 4-6,
<br>&nbsp; 9-6, 9-12, 16-12, 16-20....but defending for an 8-move turn
<br>&nbsp; must be a nightmare.&nbsp; with 1,2,2,2,2...the analysis paralysis
<br>&nbsp; problem may be held under control.&nbsp; however, this fairy chess
<br>&nbsp; version may have already been shown to lead to an unsatisfactory
<br>&nbsp; game in the past. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<br>Progressive chess has been played a lot and is alive and well.&nbsp; White
<br>has an advantage, but no larger than in regular chess.&nbsp; The 1,2,2,...
<br>move pattern is used in Marseillais Chess and Balanced Doublemove
<br>chess, both of which have been played quite a bit and are excellent
<br>variants.&nbsp; It is also used in Doublemove Go, an interesting Go variant
<br>that hasn't been played enough.&nbsp; And I'm sure there are other games
<br>that can be played with this pattern.
