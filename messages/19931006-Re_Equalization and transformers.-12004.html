Good god, yes! In chess for example, a whole new set of rules would need
to be tacked on. Would capturing the king be legal? Must you escape check
in the first move? Must you deliver check only in the last move? etc...

"3-move equalization"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One player, the "Placer", plays a (legal) move for first-mover, then one for
second-mover, then another for first-mover. The other player, the "Chooser", 
then decides on the basis of the board state obtained, whether he wants to
be second-mover (and continue with the next move), or first-mover (and let his
opponent continue).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
So the Placer is under some pressure to play three moves that leave "exactly"
equal chances, and the Chooser must try to find a flaw in this attempt. (The
question of who gets to be Chooser can be determined by lot; or in a match,
alternately).  This seems such a good method to me that I wonder it has never
been the rule in special tournaments. It would have the further advantage(e.g 
in chess)that standard opening theory would not become quite so over-analysed.

I fully agree that 3-move eq is a viable way to balance out a game without
changing its character. I doubt it would be practical to apply it to chess,
however; between players strong enough that the first-move advantage makes a
difference, it would probably result in even more draws than there already
are- which I regard as one of that game's weak points. As far as opening
theory goes, in the short term you're right, but if 3meq became common
practice it would result in its own sort of openings, probably just as
exhaustively analysed as the current ones.

One nice feature of 3meq is that it can turn (some games that might be nice if
it weren't for the fact that the first player gets a HUGE advantage) into
fair and playable games. Consider n-dimensional tictactoe, which coincidentally
I was harping about not long ago in this newsgroup. If the board size is odd,
the first player just plays in the center cell, and the second player can
pretty much forget about winning. 3meq can change that, although it can't
change the drawish nature of the game if the length of a winning row is too
long.

One game I hope to apply 3meq to soon is Twixt. One of my email opponents
(I'm always looking for more, by the way) may be strong enough to usually win
as red. If he beats me again I'm going to propose 3meq to him. Actually,
1meq may be all that's necessary for Twixt.
