There's an argument to be made in favor of the idea that an ideal game
is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> drawless.  The idea is that two perfect players should play
to a draw in an ideal game, and that any other outcome is both an
unseemly asymmetry, and a violation of the principle of fairness, to
be expunged.  So, what would draws in an ideal game be like?  Perhaps
an ideal game would have exactly one drawn state.

Having exactly one drawn state doesn't really matter.  Consider this
game:

The board is an odd number of spaces in a line.  A token is placed in
the middle. Each player starts with N coins.  Players alternate paying
a number of coins to move the token that many spaces in their
direction.  You can pass (only) when you have no coins.  The game ends
when both players have no coins.  The winner is the one who has the
token closest to himself.  If it is in the middle, it is a draw.

The game obviously has only one drawn position: The token in the
middle and both players have 0 coins.  But this is the only possible
outcome of the game, so it is not interesting.

A variant of this is fairly well known and nontrivial: Both players
secretly bid any number of coins and the winner gets to move the token
one space in their direction (on a tie the token doesn't move).  Both
pay their bids.  If both bid 0, the game ends.  The winner is the one
who has the token closest to himself.  If it is in the middle, it is a
draw.

Unlike the above, this is not a total-information game, so the notion
of perfect play doesn't exist.  So we really need to restrict
ourselces to total-information games,

The interesting properties for a total-information game with draw
would be:

 1. No game can go on forever (there is a maximum number of moves in a
    game).

 2. With perfect play, no player can obtain more than a draw.

 3. Perfect play is not obvious.

The first is usually fairly easy to decide, the second is well-defined
but can be hard to prove.  For example, Chess is AFAIK still not known
to lead to a draw with perfect play.

The third property is not well-defined, as "obvious" is a subjective
property.  A reasobable way of defining non-obviousness is
computational complexity: If the problem of finding an optimal move is
computationally hard, then it is non-obvious.

Usually, for a game to be computationally hard, there has to be a
large number of legal (and not obviously bad) moves in each turn and
the number of turns in a game has to be high.  Go is a prime example:
You have an average of around 100 possible moves per turn (though many
are obviously bad) and there number of turns is around 100.

Connection games (Hex or similar) can be modified to be like this in
the following way: There are not enough tokens to fill the board.

While a completely filled board is a win by one side or the other in
Hex, Y, etc., partially filled boards can be tied (neither side has a
connection).  A plausible Hex variant could be: Use an NxN board,
where N is odd.  Give each player (N^2-1)/2 tokens.  This leaves
exactly one space empty, and both players get the same number of
moves.
