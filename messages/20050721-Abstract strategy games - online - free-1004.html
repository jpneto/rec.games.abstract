It seems I'm always right behind Dyder =)  We're quite different sites
though.  I have a site of abstract boardgames called Super Duper Games
at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://games.daltons.ca">http://games.daltons.ca</a>.  The site is completely free with no
advertising.  It is human-vs-human play only and play is asynchronous.
You don't have to be at the computer at the same time as your opponent.
 The community is small, but growing, and there is always room for
more.  I try to focus on little known, but interesting abstract
strategy games.  We have 15 games currently implemented including David
Whitcher's "Cannon", a few Warpspawn games (Linear Progression, Fortac,
and others), Tim Schutz's "Wizard's Garden" and "Generatorb," and more.
 We hope a few of you will join us.

Cheers!
