As promised, here is our (Joao Neto's and my) best variant of
pure race Quoridor games.

The basic idea is that each player has FOUR pawns, which can
move one step horizontally or vertically, each pawn starting
on one edge of the board, and having to make its way to the
opposite edge, and cross over it off the board.

As in all Quoridor games, no player may make a move that
prevents any pawn from eventually achieving its objective.
We deliberated as to what the overall game object should be -

1.  To get at least one off;
2.  To get at least two off;
3.  To get at least three off;
4.  To get all four off.

After some brief experimentation, we decided on 3; it seems to
give the best balance between having to get most/all off,
but not being completely crippled by having a single pawn
sent into a horrible tangly maze.

As to the walls, it is also up for grabs whether or not:

A:  Should they be allowed to be placed along the board edges?
B:  Should they be merely length-2 traditional straight walls,
    or also allow L-shaped length-2 walls?

After many trials, we eventually settled on allowing both
walls along edges AND L-shaped walls.  As people's mileages
vary on the matter of traditionalism/freedom among variants,
these two rules could be considered variable without changing
the essential nature of the game.  L-shaped walls seem weird
at first, but there are many places where it is the most
natural and skill-promoting thing to have.

So then, hoping that the diagrams come out right for your server,
here is our final version...

FOUR-WAY FENCES
===============
* One player has stones n s e w, the other N S E W.

* Each stone must try to cross
                     the boundary furthest in its name-direction.
* With 2444 equalizer, in each turn each of a player's stones,
   (move order at the mover's discretion), must move one orthogonal
    step; then a length-2 wall or L is played, it may be along
                                 the boundaries but not beyond.
* A player may not completely block off any opponent stone
                                                    from its goal.
* If any stones are adjacent to the moving stone in its
  chosen direction, it may jump them to the next vacant cell.
  If a wall blocks this direction part-way through such a jump,
                        either available right-angle may be turned.
* The winner is the first player to get three stones off the board.

The initial board set-up is as below:

     A   B  C  D   E   F  G   H  I   J
a + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  + a
   :               S              s               :

   :                                                :
d :   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   : d
   : e                                         W :

   : E                                         w :
h :   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   : h
   :                                                :
i  :   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +    : i

j  :   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   : j
   :               n             N                :
k + - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - + k
     A  B  C   D   E   F  G   H  I    J

_______________________________________________________

Here is a sample game, to hopefully clarify any rule ambiguity.

(Note that the "equalization" referred to above, means that
 on the first move the first plater makes only two moves.)

The recording notation is pretty obvious I hope - numbers denote
L-pieces, 1 is a first quadrant sketch; 2, 2nd; etc as for graphs.

The piece moves are recorded in order "NEWS" - an easy mnemonic! :)
Numbers in the piece move section indicate jumps.

At this point, Joao (small letters) seems to be ahead.
His s piece has a huge way to go, but one piece can be
abandoned for the race, and he can still use it to help others
with jumping.  (Somewhat of a Halma element there!)

BUT... it may have been a mistake to take "w" off so early,
or at least to get it so isolated, because Bill is now able
to make better use of the jumpinmg rule:

Bill&gt;  My next 5 moves are  4222, N333, N333, N333, out;
Bill&gt;  with a Bf| as soon as I've past it.
Bill&gt;  Which leaves you one move short of victory!
Bill&gt;   YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYY!!!
Bill&gt;  Let's hear it for the jumping counters!!
Bill&gt;   A long-awaited victory!
