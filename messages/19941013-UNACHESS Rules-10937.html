                     *** UNACHESS ***
                  Invented by Jeff Miller 
              with help from Edward Jackman
                Official Rules of Unachess: 
 
 1. All pieces are exactly the same as in standard chess.
 
 2. The board is initially empty and each player has the normal complement 
    of 16 pieces 'in hand'. 
  
 3. The players alternate turns. White plays first.
 
 4. During a turn, a player must do one of three things: 
    a. place a piece from in hand on an empty square on the board
    b. move a previously placed piece to an empty square 
    c. move a previously placed piece onto a square occupied by an opposing 
       piece, capturing it.
 
 5. Captured pieces are NOT returned to the game ala Shogi. Once a piece is 
    captured, it's out of the game completely.
  
 6. Pawns may be entered on the second, third or fourth rows only. Pawns 
    entered on the second row have the power of an initial double move 
    and may be captured en passant as in standard chess.
 
 7. Upon reaching the eighth row, pawns are promoted to a Queen, Rook, 
    Bishop or Knight without restriction as in standard chess.
 
 8. Any piece, including pawns MAY be dropped in to deliver checkmate. 
    (as opposed to the Shogi rule)
 
 9. Bishops are NOT required to be placed on opposite colors. 
 
10. Castling (though unlikely) is allowed if King and Rook are on 
    traditional squares, and all the normal conditions required for castling 
    exist. (This will never, ever happen.)
 
11. You MAY NOT make a capture until your own King is on the board. 
    Your pieces have no real power of check on the opposing King until your 
    own King is placed. Your opponent can legally place his or her King 
    right next to your Queen if your King is still in hand. 

12. The object is to checkmate the opposing King.

Starting board:

- - - - - - - -       Black's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -       rrbbnnqk
- - - - - - - -       pppppppp
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -       White's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - -
                      RRBBNNQK
                      PPPPPPPP


After a few moves:

- - - - - - - -       Black's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - -
- - - - n - - -       rrbbn-qk
- - - - - - - -       pppppppp
- - - - - B - -
- - - - P - - -
- - - - - - - -       White's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - -
                      RRB-NNQK
                      PPPPPPP-

White       Black

1.  P&gt;e3    n&gt;g5
2.  B&gt;f4    n-c6


The '&gt;' symbol means a piece is placed from the reserve.

The '-' symbol represents a move of a piece already on the board.

Using an 'x' as in Bxe2 represents a capture.

Using a '+' as in B-e2 + represents check on the opponents king.

Using a '++' or a '#' represents checkmate.

Using a '!+' means 'not' check or virtual check. This means your king has not
yet been placed so you cannot capture or give check yet, but one or more of
your pieces is 'aiming' at the opponents king.


Example:


- - - k - - - -       Black's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -       rrbbn-q-
- - - - - - - -       pppppppp
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - n Q -       White's pieces in reserve:
- - - - - - - K
                      RRBBNN--
                      PPPPPPPP
