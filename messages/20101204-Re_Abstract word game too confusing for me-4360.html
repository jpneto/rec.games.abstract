Games like Clobber and Nim are revered by that group too.

Particle Bond

I'm sure I could convince at least Aaron Dalton to program the game.
It'd be like "hey Aaron, how about programming this game". It's
trivial. What's he going to say, "no"? I'd be surprised to say the
least. Please Steere, don't waste the popularity argument on me. We're
both more than familiar with what sort of games are popular, Gipf,
Trax, that sort of thing. Flume isn't played every day. There are long
periods when no games of Flume are played. Why aren't people playing
PB? Because it sucks? Go ahead and believe that if you want (I'm sure
you do) however I will take into account the opinions of everyone who
cared to learn the ins and outs of the game and the generally positive
things they had to say about it.

"It's the game I wish I had designed."
Nick Bentley on Particle Bond

Daniel Schultz (who I'm not on bad terms with actually) told me he was
planning on using PB in one of his abstract game workshops. He's
planned for Oust, he didn't say anything about Flume. I never said
Flume sucked though, just that it doesn't seem like a "hit" to me.
Yeah it has some design interest where the similarity to dots and
boxes is concerned, there's not much else to it.  When I played Flume
with Arty he said that like Dots and Boxes it lacked clarity
especially in the opening.

You accused me of only caring about recognition yet it's you who
always brings up the popularity argument and you who compares himself
to Michelangelo. I don't even so much as mention any of my games until
you provoke me to. You're gradually earning yourself the official
title of attention whore.
