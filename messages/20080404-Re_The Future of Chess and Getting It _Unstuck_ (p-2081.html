I'm surprised you didn't mention Go here, since it has a bigger game
tree. Of course, computers are improving there too, but at least it
has a little time left.

Then there's the game of Gess, which seems to have been deliberately
devised to be a game for supergeniuses and extraordinarily difficult
for computers.

And I'm suprised you mention Gess here, since I've never heard of
it :-) I have heard of Arimaa and Havannah, though, and my impression
is that the only reason these "designed for humans" games haven't been
beaten by computers yet is that so few are working on it. No game
deserves the label computer resistant unless academic programmers have
been working on it for at least ten years, IMO.
