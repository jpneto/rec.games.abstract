Terrace - looks and sounds cool. I really like Abalone, and this
  seems very similar. Anyone play it? :D

This one didn't impress me-- it has Abalone's elegant look, until you
actually touch the pieces, and the game itself isn't helped much by the
board and pieces-- would work almost as well with graph paper and a pencil.
Definitely know what's in the box before buying.

Well, I got the game as a Christmas present, and while the construction is
mid-grade, it's not all <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> bad...  Yes, the stones are hollow plastic,
but solid enough.

I don't think it would work well as a graph paper and pencil game - too much
moving around.  (Graph paper and various bits of paper, perhaps.)  The rules
are very simple, yet the consequences of the rules seem to be quite complex,
from the games I've played so far.

Admittedly, I've not played a lot of abstract games lately - but if Othello
and chess fit in here, Terrace should, too.
