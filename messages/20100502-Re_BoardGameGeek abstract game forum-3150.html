lol  Thanks fizzy.  I went back to bgg to follow up on the Oust topic
and then got sucked into the stupidity again, this time in the person
of Richard Hutnik.  I conducted myself as civilly as I know how but I
just got another geekslap from Mistress Octavia.  Now I'm done.

I was just writing something about this when I read your post.  Stay
tuned....

So, Mark, are you not going to be returning to the BGG forum?  That
would be a loss, except for those with thin skins.  I thought your
conduct on BGG was fine: you generated some real discussions, you
called nonsense when you thought you read it, as is your right, and
you (mostly?) refrained from vulgarity.  So I guess we're going back
to stuff like "what is your favorite Kris Burm game?"  Or "how many
categories should IAGO have?"  Sigh.
