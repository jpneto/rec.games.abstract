What is wrong with Shou Dou Qi?
==========================

by Panther!


Shou Dou Qi is a Chinese children's game described by Hans Bodlaender in his
fantastic online book on chess variants.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/animal.html">http://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/animal.html</a>

His description of Shou Dou Qi is based on E. Glonnegger's "Das Spielebuch"
and R.C. Bell's "Board and Table Games from many Civilizations". Both
authors are extremely unreliable and their books should, if possible, NOT be
used as the only source of a game.

I used the following source:

Rainer Schmidt. Das spielt das Volk in China. China Studien- und
Verlagsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main1981.

According to another book Rainer Schmidt was the founder and the first
president of the German Xiang Qi Association.

Schmidt's rules of Shou Dou Qi were reviewed  by Professor Dr. Yu Chen-Lie
before publication. For that reason alone my source can be considered
sufficiently reliable.

Bodlaender's rules of Shou Dou Qi are essentially correct, however, some of
his comments show that he is uncertain about this pleasant fact.

Bodlaender mentions an observation of Jeff Mallet that appears to be rather
superficial and the authenticity of Jean-Louis Cazaux's Shou Dou Qi variant
could be doubted as well.

Bodlaender states:
--------------------------

" A piece of a player in one of his own trap squares cannot be taken by the
opponent. Pieces in a trap square of the opponent are very weak: they can be
taken by any other piece when in such a trap square.
As observed by Jeff Mallett, this rule is probably wrong: one should just
have fill each of ones traps by a piece and the opponent can never reach the
den."

My critique:

(1)
It should be noted that many old "ethno-" games and, probably, even more
modern "capitalist" games have rules which allow an easy drawing strategy.
Examples are Abalone, Outwit, Jumpin, Chessball, Rondo, early Halma and Shou
Dou Qi! This doesn't mean that the rules are wrong, it means that the
authors made a stupid mistake or that the games were not meant to be played
by truly intelligent people.

Some classic games have extremely difficult drawing startegies such as Nine
Men's Morris (not really proved because Ralf Gasser didn't use the official
rules of the World Morris Federation) or Teeko (i don't know if the advanced
tournament rules were used when the game was "solved"). However, both games
are rather difficult to draw and no human player has been able to reproduce
these drawing strategies in actual play. In the worst case (champion level
of play) about 50% of Morris games ends in a draw and less than 5% of Teeko
games.


(2)
It is not true that when you have filled each of your traps with a piece the
opponent can never reach the den. Your opponent needs only to capture all
your other pieces. Then one of your pieces would have to leave your trap and
could be captured.. Note: You must move in Shou Dou Qi ("Zugzwang"!).

Nevertheless, Mallet's idea pointed into the right direction.

You can draw Shou Dou Qi by

(1) moving your elephant to your central trap
-- while --
(2) occupying the other two traps with any other
      pieces (except your rat)
-- and --
(3) moving your rat onto a water square.

You must do all these three things!

Only then it doesn't matter what your opponent is doing. Always, you will
EITHER be able to move your elephant forth from and back to your central
trap OR your rat inside the lake WITHOUT jeopardizing them. Your opponent
cannot threaten to capture both, your elephant and your rat, at the same
time.

In other words:

If you want to capture an elephant which is moving from a central trap
because of Zugzwang you need an elephant and a rat on the squares diagonally
in front of him.
If you want to capture a rat which is in a lake (again: because of Zugzwang)
you need your rat  to chase it away.
If you want to do both, you need two rats.
You only have one rat. Therefore you cannot do both.

For that reason Shou Dou Qi is indeed a draw. But it is much more
complicated than claimed by Mallet and Bodlaender
