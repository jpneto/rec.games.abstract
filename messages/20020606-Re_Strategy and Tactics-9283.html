Are you deliberately trying to misread what I say?
There are no published instances of any computer program making
a sacrifice for strategic reasons.  Of course this does not mean
that some new program won't do so, and I never said it did.  But
the lack of any prior examples is a good reason to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>EXPECT<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that
it won't.  In fact, it would be illogical to expect otherwise.

As I already mentioned, the computer printouts following the match
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>proved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that the computer did not make a sacrifice for strategic
reasons.  For the computer, it was not a sacrifice at all; it simply
searched deep enough into the position where it could see that it
would regain the sacrificed material and then some.

Again, this completely foolish analysis (assuming that because other
computer programs had not succeeded in achieving X, this more powerful
computer program wouldn't be able to do X either, even though it's known
to be more powerful than the previous programs that failed to do X) is
precisely the psychological mistake that Kasparov later made, at a very
high cost to him.  Kasparov clearly believed that there were certain
"kinds" of moves that computers could find, and other kinds of moves
that computer players would be unable to find, by their nature.  And
this was clearly demonstrated to be very wrong.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

FYI, the version of Deep Blue that defeated Kasparov did <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>NOT<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
make any sacrifices.  There is still not a single published instance
of a computer program making a sacrifice for strategic reasons.
You have to look elsewhere to find the reasons for Kasparov's loss.


A big reason why Deep Blue won is that due to faster hardware, it
was able to search deeper into the position than ever before. 
The available data consistently shows that the ELO rating of a
given computer program increases linearly with the depth of the
search.  Another reason for the loss is Kasparov's inadequate
preparation, due at least in part if not in whole to the fact
that there were no public games between Deep Blue and other
grandmasters.  If there had been some games, Kasparov would have
had a more accurate idea of what to expect and he could have
studied the games looking for weaknesses in Deep Blue's play
that he could exploit.  Also, the programming team spoke
tantalizingly about some secret algorithms that have never
been make public.  It's impossible to say what effect they
had. Blah Blah Blah Blah ....

Anyway, this is all beside the point; the reasons for Deep Blue's
victory have nothing to do with my statement about strategic
sacrifices.

Of course, the computer
scientists observing the matches already knew that---but it was
demonstrating it to the public that was necessary, as your comments
show.  Your comments also demonstrate that some members of the public,
like Kasparov, didn't necessarily get it, even after it was
demonstrated.

Now that's funny.

First, your attempted appeal to authority is not a valid argument
but rather a well known logical fallacy.  The truthfulness of a
statement does not depend on who says it.  If a moron says the
sky is blue, then he is right.  If a Nobel prize winner says
2 + 2 = 5, then they are wrong.

The thing that makes your appeal to "computer scientists"
funny is that I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>am<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a computer scientist!  I'll be defending
my Ph.D. dissertation this August.  I've had a professional
interest in computer chess for 20 years and in fact, wrote
a computer chess program as part of my master's thesis.  I
don't know which mythical computer scientists you are referring
to but the colleagues I know do not share your simplistic and
inaccurate view. (They also can understand an english sentence,
do not quote out of context, and address a person's actual
position instead of some strawman distortion of it.)
