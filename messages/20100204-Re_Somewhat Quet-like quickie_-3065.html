Here are some mins/maxes from a few thousand simulations of random
play on a square grid:
size 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
min  1  4  4  4  6  7  8  9 10 11 13 14 16 17
max  1  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 17 19 21 23 24 26
Greedy algorithms might be able to improve those bounds.

There is a six-cell selection which fits on the
5x5 board but actually "covers" the 6x6 board:

+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| X |   | X |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| X |   |   |   | X |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   | X |   | X |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Thus the minimum for size 6 can be lowered
to 6.  I wrote a Prolog program to solve
such puzzles, and it finds the solution
above in about 10 minutes.  I'm making
some tweaks to how it intializes the
board for speed, because you have to
search in some fashion the entire space
to confirm no smaller solution exists.

Nice! I did notice such N-fits-into-N+1-with-no-room-for-more 
situations in smaller sizes, but by hand it was too much to look 
at the many various 5's.

I can't say I know enough about prolog to know how it would cope
with bigger board sizes. I presume that it scales roughly as
scarily as the N-queens problem.

Thanks for your interest.
