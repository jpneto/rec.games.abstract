This can be considered both a puzzle and a solitaire game.

Make an n-by-n grid on paper. (I suggest that n = 3 for beginners.)

Fill the grid with UNIQUE positive integers, one integer per square of
the grid. The numbers need not be consecutively valued necessarily.

Your score is the largest integer m such that integers 1 through m all
occur as sums within the grid (without missing any positive integers
&lt;=m).

A "sum" is of any number of addends (possibly just 1) that are all
consecutively placed within a row of the grid or a column of the grid.
(No diagonals in this variation.)

So, for example, if we have the following 3-by-3 grid:

2 9 8
3 1 10
7 6 15

...the sums 1 through 19 all occur in this grid. So, I get a score of
19.
(Notice that some values of sums occur more than once.)

I bet it is easy to do better than I did with a 3-by-3 grid, since my
grid is inefficient, and I didn't try too hard to find it.

(Note: There are 27 possible sums in a 3-by-3 grid of 1, 2, or 3
addends. I don't know what the largest possible score is for a 3-by-3
grid, though.)

You can "play" someone else by both of you trying to score as well as
you can on the same-sized grid. Just try to outscore your opponent.

interesting.  for 3x3 the best I can get is 20 (I think) using this:
13 6 12
7  2 14
10 3  1

I am loathe to write a program to compute the best score, but perhaps
some other enterprising person could make the attempt.  bonus points
for not using c or perl, of course.  demerits for using recursion,
blowing the stack, or causing a core fault in the math subprocessor.
documentation will count for 15% of your final grade, and keep future
programmers from cursing your name for the clever and obscure ways you
found to save 11 bytes worth of typing that cost them more than an
hour of their life which they won't get back.

it seems obvious that the best grids of size n+1 are not supersets of
the best grid of size n.  that makes this game more fun as you
progress.
