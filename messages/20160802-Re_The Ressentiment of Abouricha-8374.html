I find it quite amazing that anyone can hold as much bitter jealousy over something one is not cut out to do as Abouricha has expressed towards abstract game designers. Substantial designers- having made  their mark already- may very reasonably find themselves pulled into the raw bloodsport of mechanic acquisition and occassionally left to impotently gnash their teeth at the swallowing-up of another good idea by some colleague. But Abouricha hasn't any good ideas. No insight nor any talent, nor so much as a good sensibility where regards game design. The hostility Abouricha has towards the design community seems notably misplaced. I will say I have scrambled a bit in the Rockies but never have I taken anything other than a perfunctory interest in mountaineering. I demonstrate neither a passion nor a natural ability for mountaineering and therefore it only seems reasonable that I should have no cause to begrudge the greatest moutaineers recognition in their field. Same goes for Circket players, sculptors, yacht-racers etc... Likewise Abouricha demonstrates no real affinity for abstract game design but he has nonetheless styled himself as an agonistic critic here. But he might just as well be ranting about drumming technique, Starcraft players or something equally absurd. Even if Abouricha has a genuine interest in abstract games (which I doubt due to his pig-headed obstinacy) he simply cannot be said to have invested himself personally enough to justify the level of envy he exudes. There is of course the category of forms of endevor I have barely any interest in but apart from that there is the category of endeavor where I have a significant level of interest but remain so incredibly bad that to look upon the upper echelons with envy is preposterous. One such endeavour is Go. As a Go player, I am abysmal and I was even able to attain a record low ELO on iggamecenter. I simply remain so far down the ladder of Go players that to become green-eyed when observing the games of Lee Sedol or Lee Chang Ho would require an incredible level of arrogance on my part. Of course Abouricha is arrogance incarnate but the question is really what gets him so worked up about game design when he clearly doesn't even have the capital necessary to cover the buy-in? Nobody other than Abouricha himself even regards Hazen Abouricha as a designer- at the very least that consideration takes a backseat to his reputation as an unironically farcical internet gremlin- and yet here he is ranting and raving and speaking from intellectual poverty about a subject he has no knowledge of. Its an anomaly to say the least.

Mission accomplished! I`m really happy! 
Abouricha is surely the best game designer of the 21 century.

Many think they're the best.  Christian, Luis, Abouricha, etc.  But there is, and will remain.  Only One.  Mark Steere.
