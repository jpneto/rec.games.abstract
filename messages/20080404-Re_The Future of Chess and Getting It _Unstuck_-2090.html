<br>I have never seen anyone provide a single bit of data in

<br>I believe, after reading various accounts, that Chess' popularity had
<br>been declining for decades before there was a boost inspired by the
<br>famous international competitions, which was then followed by further
<br>decline.&nbsp; Then the appearance of Chess on the Internet caused a surge
<br>in popularity.
<br>
<br>There's the added complication of an ever increasing number of other
<br>quality abstract games to choose from.&nbsp; But there should be some limit
<br>to Chess' peak popularity.&nbsp; For example, the percentage of people who
<br>play Chess ten times a year or more, in real life or online, will
<br>never exceed x percent.&nbsp; I'll hazard a timid guess that x is less than
<br>20.&nbsp; I don't know how near Chess' popularity is to its limit now, or
<br>even if the peak has already passed, but yes, there should be some
<br>limit.&nbsp; And there should be a lower limit too.&nbsp; Chess' popularity,
<br>measured as described, shouldn't drop below y percent over the next
<br>millennium.
<br></blockquote>
<br>My claim wasn't that there is no limit, but that there is no evidence
<br>that we are near the limit. The usual "chess will never be as popular
<br>as [football, food, sex etc.]" is an irrelevancy.
