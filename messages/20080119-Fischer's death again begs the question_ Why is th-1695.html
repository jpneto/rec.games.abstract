I have asked this before on here I believe.  Well, the death of
Fischer begs the question once more.  I also posted this on Boardgame

Bobby Fischer's death is in the news, and causes people to remember
the 1970s, when chess was king, and people tuned into PBS to watch
chess. Chess was a culturally iconic back then. I remember reading Mad
Magazine when I was a kid, and they actually did a spoof with a chess
based superhero. Fischer made all the magazine covers, and it was
WWIII on the board. It wasn't just the Cold War either. When America
beat Russia in the Winter Olympics at hockey, and played them, there
wasn't an outbreak of hockey all over, like there was with Chess. I
remember when I was a kid in the 1970s, there was a chess store that
opened up near where I lived.

So, what has happened here? There is no chess on TV now. Rock, Paper,
Scissors made it to ESPN. Hot dog eating made ESPN. Poker is all over
TV. Scrabble is on TV also. But, there isn't chess. As far as I know,
no one has even bothered to pick up the rights to the World Mind Sport
Games in China either for western broadcast. The event has Chess,
Checkers, Go, Chinese Chess, and Bridge also, and is pretty big event
(first of its kind, and an offshoot of the Olympics). There was a
chess championship for over $1.5 million in Mexico last year, and no
one even knew of it, outside of the chess world.

So, again I ask, why is there no chess on TV? Also, any ideas what can
be done to get it on TV? Chess could open the doorway for a lot of
boardgames ending up on TV, if it could be on TV and remain there. My
take is the pacing of the moves, plus excessive amount of draws where
players score equally for the draw, are two major factors why not.

Please don't get me started about American Gladiator being back, or
the fact that guys fixing motorcycles has a TV show. I can close by
saying a program about people have dirty jobs actually is on TV now.
Come on! All this and no chess?
