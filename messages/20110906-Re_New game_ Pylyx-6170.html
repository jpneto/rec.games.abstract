Leaving balancing mechanisms aside, I think Pylyx is potentially an
interesting game. My main fear is that it may be too drawish, but this
is also an "outlandish claim", because I don't have a Pylyx games
database at hand yet  :-)

Neither do I, and barring an applet I have little opportunities to
actually play. I've given drawishness some considerable thought and
it's clear that trapped single are the main targets. Once you've got
say 3-3-2-2 it would be hard to block, so at that point it's more like
a race with little chance to draw.
So obviously you'd try to get your singles away from the edge, and
even if trapped, there's more than one way to liberate a single. At
the same time, an opponent bend on drawing could try to wall in a
single completely. That's what made me reconsider what Phil said: "So
it's like a game of just running away from threats, with less
incentive to actually achieve a winning position."

That wouldn't be in the game's spirit. It's meant to be a quick
positional game with fairly obvious tactics. And I like the way it
moves, so I've solved it by adding four 10x1 sidebars that must remain
empty in the initial set-up.
Not unlike the Cage board: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/cage-607">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/cage-607</a>
(but checkered like the rest of the board and indeed part of the
playing area).
That should solve any of the anticipated problems.
