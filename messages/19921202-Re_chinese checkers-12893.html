Last night my 9-year-old pretty much conceded loss and kept his playing
piece in my home until he had no other move except his home pieces.  Is
this actually legal?  Except for his blockage, I would have won.  He was
pretty pleased to thwart my efforts, if he couldn't win.

One simple modification to prevent this sort of thing happening is to
let the winner be the first person to fill the side opposite them with
pieces, at least one of which is their own color. In the case you
mention, this means that once you had filled in the spots not occupied
by your opponent, you would have won. I doubt this is an "official"
rule.
