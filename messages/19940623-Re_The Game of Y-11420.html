Oh really, Dan, wow!  Another great ascii picture; to go with your many others.

Thanks heaps for taking the trouble to type it all in. (Unless it was done by
your cutely Y-board-shaped program, which I haven't tried yet; in which case
thanks for taking the trouble to program that!)

Really, a great post; we should have more of these!  And yes, I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> spot
your injunction to confine fan mail to email, but I actually have something
substantive to say as well.    I hope.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Right now, I'm considering whether there might be a way to create a
family of winning configurations for the projective icosahedron,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Great idea!  

However, it seems to me there's an obvious candidate rule sticking out like
a sore thumb.  Namely, a winning position is one which includes a closed loop
which is non-contractable-to-a-point (topologically).  A bit of fiddling
with projective planes with pencil and paper should quickly convince one
that it has the requisite properties; particularly, it is strongly drawless.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But the family of winning positions of Y is not symmetric enough: There 
should be sixty symmetries.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well I may be missing something here, but I think my rule covers this. Any
(sufficiently asymmetric) winning loop has 60 different placements on the 
board.    e.g. think of a path going 4/5 around one pentagon, with one end
taking a sharp left away from the pentagon and the other a gentle right away
from it, then the two path-ends travelling more or less directly away from
each other to meet over the boundary.  This clearly has 60 placements:- there
are 6 possible pentagons; and 10 ways around each for the 4/5-circle, that is
2 senses and 5 rotations for each sense.   (I hope <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> also makes sense!)

Have I blundered somewhere, or does this solve your query?  

I really like your idea for a fully-symmetric, boundary-free game; and I hope
my simple winning rule is right, coz I rather like the look of that too.  :)

Another possibility is the chiral icosahedron,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

OK, you've got me at last!  What on earth is this?  I think I could guess at
it, maybe even successfully, but could you elaborate further for us?


Again - nice post Dan.     Thanks.
