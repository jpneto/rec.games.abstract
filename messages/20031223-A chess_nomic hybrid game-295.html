I have always been fascinated by the wide variety of chess variants, 
and have wanted to try to play or invent a "meta-chess" variant.  I
have also been fascinated by self-modifying games like Nomic.  So,
combining these two ideas, I have written the following Initial Rule
Set, based on Peter Suber's game of Nomic.

I would like to solicit suggestions for improvement to the Initial
Rules, and I wonder if anybody would actually like to play this "game".


* Article I

- Section 1.  Players.

111. [immutable]
     All Players must always abide by all Rules currently in effect, in
     the form in which they are in effect.

112. [mutable]
     Any person may become a Player by notifying the Clerk of the intent
     to do so, and selecting a one-word Color not currently in use by 
     another player.

113. [mutable]
     A Player may not change his or her Color.

114. [immutable]
     Every Player is an Eligible Voter.

115. [immutable]
     A Player may forfeit the game by notifying the Clerk of the intent
     to do so.  A Player always has the option to forfeit the game
     rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty.

- Section 2.  Proposals.

121. [immutable]
     A Proposal is any of the following:
       (a) the enactment of a mutable Rule;
       (b) the repeal of a mutable Rule;
       (c) the amendment of a mutable Rule;
       (d) the transmutation of an immutable Rule to a mutable Rule or 
           vice versa; or
       (e) the alteration of the Board or the Pieces on the Board.

122. [immutable]
     Each Proposal which affects a rule must state explicitly what Rule 
     number it affects, and the type of effect it has.  Valid Rule
     numbers are those numbers between 0 and 1000 that have a
     terminating decimal expansion.  In the following paragraphs, "xxx"
     represents a Rule's number.
       (a) If a Proposal enacts a new Rule, it must have the words "Rule 
           xxx is enacted as follows:", followed by the exact text of 
           the new Rule.  A new Rule may not have the same number as a 
           currently existing Rule.
       (b) If a Proposal repeals a Rule, it must state "Rule xxx is 
           repealed."  
       (c) If a Proposal amends a Rule, it must state "Rule xxx is 
           amended to read as follows:", followed by the exact text of 
           the Rule as it would read if the Proposal were adopted.
       (c) If it transmutes a Rule, it must state either:
           (1) "Immutable Rule xxx is now mutable."; or
           (2) "Mutable Rule xxx is now immutable."

123. [immutable]
     All Proposals must be submitted to the Clerk before they are voted
     on.  If they are adopted, they shall modify the rules according to  
     the form in which they were voted on.

124. [immutable]
     All Proposals submitted in the proper way shall be voted on.  They
     will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of
     votes.

125. [immutable]
     Neither a Proposal, nor a Rule enacted by a Proposal, may take 
     effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that 
     adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise; no 
     Rule may ever have a retroactive effect.

126. [immutable]
     Each Proposal shall be given a number for reference.  The first 
     properly-submitted Proposal shall receive the number 1, and each 
     subsequent properly-submitted Proposal shall receive the next 
     successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.

Section 3.  Votes.

131. [mutable]
     Before every Player has taken two Turns, the required number of 
     votes to adopt a Proposal is equal to the number of the votes cast.  
     After every Player has taken two Turns, the required number of 
     votes to adopt a Proposal is equal to a majority of the votes cast.

132. [mutable]
     The vote on a Proposal is considered completed when every Eligible 
     Voter has had the opportunity to vote.  When the vote on a Proposal 
     is incomplete, the Proposal is considered pending.

Section 4.  Clerk.

141. [mutable]
     The Clerk shall keep record of:
      (a)  All Rules and Proposals;
      (b)  All Players, their Colors, and their Points;
      (c)  The Board and the Pieces on the Board;
      (d)  All Moves made; and
      (e)  Which Player's Turn it is.

142. [mutable]
     As soon as practicable, at the end of each Player's Turn, the Clerk 
     shall inform every Player of:
      (a)  What Proposals are still pending;
      (b)  The result of each vote that has been completed during the 
            most recent Turn;
      (c)  The full text of each new Proposal;
      (d)  The full text of each newly-adopted Proposal;
      (e)  The list of all Players in the game, their Colors, and their 
           Points;
      (f)  Which Player's Turn it is; and
      (g)  The time by which that Player's Turn will end.

143. [mutable]
     Upon request by any Player, the Clerk must inform that Player of:
      (a)  Any or all currently active Rules; or
      (b)  The full text of any pending or past Proposal.

144. [mutable]
     The Clerk may, but is not required to be, a Player.

145. [mutable]
     The Clerk shall be selected at the beginning of the game.

Section 5.  Conflict of Rules.

151. [immutable]
     In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable Rule, the 
     immutable Rule takes precedence and the mutable Rule shall be 
     entirely void.  For the purposes of this rule a Proposal to 
     transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable 
     rule.

152. [mutable]
     If two or more immutable Rules conflict with one another, or if two 
     or more immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the rule 
     with the lowest Rule number takes precedence.  If at least one of 
     the rules in conflict says of itself that it defers to another rule 
     (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the 
     numerical method for determining precedence.  If two or more rules 
     claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one 
     another, then the numerical method again governs.

153. [mutable]
     If players disagree about the legality of a Proposal or Move, or 
     about the interpretation or application of a Rule or Rules, then
     the Clerk shall decide the question.

Article II

- Section 1.  Turns.

211. [mutable]
     Players shall rotate in the order in which they became Players, 
     taking one whole Turn apiece.  The first Player's Turn is next 
     after the last Player's Turn.

212. [mutable]
     Each Player's Turn shall begin immediately when the previous 
     Player's Turn ends.

213. [mutable]
     The first Player's Turn begins 72 hours after two people have 
     become Players.

214. [mutable]
     Each Player's Turn shall end no later than 72 hours after that 
     Player's Turn has begun.

215. [mutable]
     During each Player's Turn, that player must do the following, in 
     order:
      (a) Make one Proposal;
      (b) Vote Yes or No on each pending Proposal; and
      (c) Make a legal Move, if possible.
     Each Player's Turn shall end immediately one these steps are 
     complete.

- Section 2.  Points.

221. [mutable]
     Every Player begins with zero (0) Points.

222. [mutable]
     Whenever a Proposal is adopted, the Player who submitted that 
     Proposal gains a number of Points equal to the number of votes cast 
     in favor of the Proposal.

- Section 3.  Victory

231. [mutable]
     If every Player but one has consecutively failed to make a legal
     Move during their respective Turns, the remaining player wins.

Article III

- Section 1.  The Board

311. [mutable]
     The Board is composed of 64 equal Squares, arranged in an 8x8 
     array.

312. [mutable]
     No Square may be occupied by more than one Piece.

- Section 2.  Moves

321. [mutable]
     There are no legal Moves other than those specified by Rules.

322. [mutable]
     A Player may make a Move by transferring a Piece of the same Color 
     as the Player from one Square to another Square, according to the 
     Rule or Rules describing that Piece.

323. [mutable]
     If the Square a Piece is Moved to is occupied by a Piece of a 
     different Color, the latter Piece is captured.  Captured Pieces are 
     removed from the game and cease to exist.

324. [mutable]
     If there is no King of the same Color as a Player, then that Player
     may make a Move by placing a King of the same Color as the Player 
     on any vacant Square that is not attacked by a Piece of a different 
     Color.

- Section 3.  Pieces

331. [mutable]
     A King moves by moving to any adjoining square (horizontally or 
     diagonally) that is:
      (a) not attacked by one or more of the opponent's pieces; and
      (b) not already occupied by a Piece of the same Color as the King.
