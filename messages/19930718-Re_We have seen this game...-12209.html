|&gt; But if you're interested in GOOD games, how about The Sigma File,
|&gt; invented by Dr. Eric Solomon? I've never seen the game, but I read about
|&gt; it in a book of classic abstract games. It's basically a 4-person
|&gt; boardgame with an international espionage setting. The object is to
|&gt; use the agents to maneuver the Sigma File document into your home city.
|&gt; One interesting twist is, you're rarely sure which agents are under your
|&gt; control, and which will turn on you. Bluffing is a major element.

This sounds remarkably like a game I used to own called Conspiracy.
You had four 2-4 players and a rather small number of spaces you played on.
Probably minimum of 5 or 6 moves from one city to the other.

There were 10 agents on the board, and one secret file that started in the 
middle.  I believe each person started out with about 10,000 bucks and had to
bid a certain price on any of the agents.  Once bid you couldn't take any money
away.  The rules were fairly simple.  Each turns, people first put money on 
agents, then they each got to move one agent.  IF an agent was on the same
square as the file, then he could move with it.  At any time a player could
stop another from moving, IF he had more money on the agent.  

This is were bluffing and such got into it.  You wouldn't want to reveal too 
much about how much money you ahd where.  I'm forgetting a few other rules.
I distinctly remember the ability to "kill" or put out of action a agent.
But its been a while.  I believe Conspiracy was but out by Milton Bradley,
and no doubt based on Dr. Solomon's Sigma File.
