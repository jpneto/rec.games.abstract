Ralf has created a Wikinfo article about me that includes a partial
but extensive list of the insults I've hurled at him dating back to
November 2005. There's also an extensive analysis of why my games are
so bad.  In the article and the associated discussion Ralf claims that
I tried to have him murdered, that a part of me is in him (I shudder
to think what part), and, perhaps most disquieting, that he has been
"studying" me for the past three years.  He refers to himself in the
third person throughout the article.  E.g. "Steere first insulted
Gering in November 2005."

Ralf, I practically forgot about you until I stumbled onto this
nonsense.  I had no idea I fucked up your whole life.  Man, let it
go.  If you don't it will eat at you until the day you die, or get
murdered or whatever.
