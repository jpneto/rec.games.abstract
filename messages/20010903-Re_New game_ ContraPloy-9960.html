I argue that point.  In my game, each player arranges and has complete

I guess I have to admit this form of luck.

On the other hand, I could argue that abstract games boil down to
tic-tac-toe, in which the winner is determined by who goes first.  But
non-trivial abstract games overcome this by introducing enough
possibilities that a human being can't perfectly process them all.  By
such a device the human element enters in.

With knife-paper-stone based games, the human element is derived from
the fact that a human being is unable to be perfectly unpredictable. 
So even in the trivial kn-p-st, if enough rounds are played in
succession, the player better able to detect the other's patterns will
prevail.

ContraPloy actually incorporates both paradigms, because unlike
kn-p-st, there are good moves and bad moves, and eventually most
information is made known.  So players must not only seek optimal
moves as in abstract, but they must paradoxically seek to be
unpredictable at the same time!

As such I think I've taken a good run at Thompson's goals of depth,
clarity, drama, and decisiveness, even as I've violated his
definition.
