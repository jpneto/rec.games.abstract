<br>I concede your point that there are aspects of chess that

<br>Your choice of the word "chances" is revealing.&nbsp; DavidR
<br>has pointed out elsewhere in this thread that chess is not a game
<br>of chance.&nbsp; Actually, my personal view is that he is wrong, and
<br>that chess at the highest levels is predominantly a game of chance;
<br>but that's a debate for another time.&nbsp; But he is right that we
<br>don't -- or at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> don't, for of course I have no access to
<br>the thought processes of anyone else -- think of chess in your
<br>terms.&nbsp; I don't recognise your examples, elsewhere, where White
<br>"calculates" [say] that he has a chance of 0.3 of winning, 0.5
<br>of drawing and 0.2 of losing if he plays move A.&nbsp; Chess simply
<br>isn't random that way. ...
<br></blockquote>
<br>You may not convert it into mathematical form (I certainly
<br>don't) but everybody knows the difference between
<br>a complicated position that could resolve either way vs.
<br>a simplified position that couldn't. We make choices as
<br>we play. With 1867 scoring, selecting a position where
<br>you have a minimal endgame advantage that you might convert is
<br>a smart choice. With alternate scoring, it's only a smart
<br>choice if you are very sure you will get the win.
<br>So you don't move that way. That gives you, and importantly
<br>your opponent, winning chances.
<br>
<br>
<br>I find it baffling that you are so absolutely
<br>confident that grandmaster chess players would not
<br>be able to adapt their chess to thrive in a world that
<br>was less draw-friendly. They would somehow be too
<br>dense to respond to an alternate set incentives.
<br>While perhaps there would be cultural reluctance,
<br>and GMs are probably as stubborn and tradition-laden
<br>as the rest of us, they are also highly skilled
<br>when it comes to playing chess. My prediction is that
<br>players could easily adapt and that we would all
<br>be rewarded with better chess. But we will
<br>never truly know the answer until we try. So
<br>why not try?
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>How many times do we read game analysis if words
<br>akin to "he took the safe draw"?
<br></blockquote>
<br>...&nbsp; Actually, quite rarely;&nbsp; and surely scarcely ever
<br>with the GM draws that seem to be what you are complaining about?
<br>If two players play a perfunctory 12 moves and agree a draw, then
<br>it scarcely matters whether the draw was safe or not, the players
<br>didn't want to fight, and such games almost never get more than a
<br>perfunctory analysis.
<br>
<br>Of course, positions do arise that are obscure, and where
<br>players have the choice of playing into these or avoiding them.
<br>But if a position is objectively about level, then "punt and hope"
<br>is really a pretty bad way to play -- certainly at the highest
<br>levels.&nbsp; You will lose a great deal more often than you will win,
<br>unless you really can show reasons why your attack might expect
<br>to succeed.&nbsp; In <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>good<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> positions, your chances are much better;
<br>and in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>bad<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> positions, any desperate throw may be worthwhile;
<br>but those are not the positions in which draws are normally
<br>offered and accepted.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>Again, you show your lack of faith in the ability of GMs
<br>to respond to alternate incentives. My answer. Why not
<br>let them try?
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>
<br><blockquote type=cite>[...] None of the sports covered in
<br>our newspapers have the characteristics that
<br>60% of encounters end in ties, with
<br>a significant number of those occurring without
<br>even playing, though.
<br></blockquote>
<br>This is a transpondian difference.&nbsp; In the UK, we
<br>have cricket.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>The rules of chess guarantee that draws have to be
<br>accounted for. The scoring system of chess guarantees
<br>that draws dominate the game.
<br></blockquote>
<br>There you go again.&nbsp; "Dominate the game"?&nbsp; Outside the
<br>very top GMs playing each other, you're talking about around 1/3
<br>of the games in reasonably high-level chess;&nbsp; and most of those
<br>are hard-fought battles with the draw a fair result.
<br></blockquote>
<br>The point is that in modern chess you cannot be successful
<br>without being able to draw a lot. That's what the empirical
<br>evidence tells us. No one has ever won Linares losing more
<br>than two games. The usual path to victory in major tournaments
<br>is "win a few, draw the rest". As long as we have a
<br>sizeable number of essentially unplayed draws, all draws
<br>are tainted. We just don't know if a draw is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
<br>hard fought. You might like to believe it is, and it might
<br>be convenient for defenders of the status quo to
<br>characterize some draws in that fashion, but the reality
<br>is we don't know if it was "hard fought" unless the penalty
<br>for drawing was severe.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>[...] If you've just had 10 days of gruelling mental
<br>activity, it's not surprising if on the 11th, with nothing at
<br>stake, you don't want to take it too seriously.&nbsp; Even if there
<br>is still something at stake, you may be in no mood to put yet
<br>another six+ hours of thought into it.&nbsp; Been there, done that.
<br></blockquote>Come on, now, you've got to be kidding. In chess, it is
<br>the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>leaders who have everything to play for<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> who play
<br>the 15 move draws.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You obviously play in different tournaments from the
<br>ones I see.&nbsp; Well, OK, I know of examples where this has
<br>happened in situations where an outsider really would have
<br>expected the players to work harder.&nbsp; No doubt there are then
<br>elements of mutual funk.&nbsp; But we're not privy to the mental
<br>state of the players.&nbsp; I doubt whether many of them would be
<br>in a better state if they scored only 0.4 for their last-
<br>round draw;&nbsp; in the example you gave elsewhere, the players
<br>clearly weren't motivated [enough] by large amounts of money,
<br>so the points for a draw can scarcely have mattered to them.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is having to *play
<br>chess* considered a hardship for professional chessplayers?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Why is taking exams considered a hardship for students?
<br>It's a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>gruelling<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> activity.
<br>
<br>[ratings:]
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>The fix is trivial.
<br></blockquote>Not really.&nbsp; You are going to get cases where player A
<br>scores more points than player B [who gets more draws] against
<br>the same standard of opposition, but B gets the higher rating
<br>as a consequence.&nbsp; Many players are somewhat precious about
<br>their ratings, so that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> going to cause problems.
<br></blockquote>The rating system has a definition of "performance" defined
<br>as (W+D/2)/(W+D+L) which is purely arbitrary. Use
<br>a different definition and all problems are solved.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Well, actually the ECF grading system is based around
<br>W-L.&nbsp; But in any case none of the rating systems I know about
<br>are "purely arbitrary".&nbsp; They have analysable behaviours.&nbsp; It
<br>is far from trivial to "use a different definition" and expect
<br>the result to have good behaviour.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Sponsorship is almost always connected with popularity.
<br>There aren't that many eccentric millionaires throwing
<br>money around.
<br></blockquote>Try looking at [eg] the 4NCL.
<br></blockquote>I don't see the point you are making. It looks like it has
<br>prizes of about 10 British pounds per player.
<br></blockquote>
<br>The prize fund [around $20K] is not to be sneezed at,
<br>but is small fry in the overall funding of the event.&nbsp; Why do
<br>you think small towns and companies can field teams of strong
<br>GMs?&nbsp; Not, assuredly, because the GMs all happen to work there,
<br>but because they get quite decent appearance fees, from the
<br>"eccentric millionaires" who sponsor them.&nbsp; And of course 4NCL
<br>is only one event;&nbsp; there are other leagues and tournaments
<br>around the world where similar things happen.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You seem to like the idea of chess having to beg
<br>for scraps from eccentric millionaires, dictators
<br>controlling FIDE, etc. I like the idea of chess
<br>thriving the way other activities do - providing
<br>an appealing product that resonates with large
<br>numbers of people who enjoy the activity.
