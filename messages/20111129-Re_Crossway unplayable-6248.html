While I think that this argument is mostly silly (if entertaining)
I've lately come to agree that designers should supply strategy notes
with their games. It's 1000x easier to understand a game and develop a
notion of why I might be interested in it with strategy notes.

If we all supplied strategy notes then the wheat might separate from
the chaff more quickly. Nobody would have paid any attention to
Slither if I hadn't spent a year haranguing people to take a look at
it. Strategy notes would have made it way easier for people to see
what's so great about it.

I've only posted strategy notes for one of my games but I can say
definitively that it's helped people see the game through my eyes.
I'm gonna do it more from now on.
