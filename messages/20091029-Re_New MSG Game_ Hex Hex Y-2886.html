... and then you go on to boast of how much your games are played.
This is not an impostor, guys, it's the Mark Steere we know :-D

By the way, that game of yours, "Oust", that you mentioned was gaining
a renaissance on igc? Turns out it was just the new game effect.
Because by now, it's surpassed by "Toguz Kumalak". That's right, Oust
has been ousted by the Dung Ball Game :-D

Could you possibly be any less significant?  I almost forgot who you
were until I looked at your profile.  Yapping little vinterdoggy from
the equally insignificant IAGO.

Oust got off to an amazing start and continues to be an outstanding
game, though apparently not as popular as the centuries old national
game of Kazakhstan at igGameCenter.  Go eat a dung ball you little
idiot.
