Note: it has been suggested that there be a "silent period" during
which solutions are not posted.  I suggest that in future I will post
a puzzle each weekend, and that people can begin posting their solutions
on the Wednesday of that week.

I think that this is a terrible idea and will really diminish discussion
of the problems.

I have a not particularly novel suggestion: Don't read followups if you
don't want to see them!!!  It's not like this is a test, and if we give
the answers away then we will distort the scoring.  We are supposed to
be grown-ups who can judge for ourselves what we do or don't want to
see.

I personally am not going to be bound by such silly restrictions.  Fair
warning if you want to put me into your kill file.  (Your loss!)
