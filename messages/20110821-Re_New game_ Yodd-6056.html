However, from a <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>human<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> perspective, which eludes and hence excludes
Mark, you're probably right. Maybe Nick can shed some light on it from
his experience with the game. Before Mark starts repeating the
obvious.

Short answer: turn order advantage is hard to Grok. I have a faint
notion that on a hexhex5 board, Even may have some advantage over Odd
with a minimum group size of 5.  On that size board the final number
of groups between good players is almost always 3, 4, 5, or 6.  I have
this idea that it may be easier to make 4 than 3, 5, or 6, but I can't
prove and could be wrong.  If I'm right, perhaps making the minimum
group size 4 or 6 would shift the probabilities to balance. Generally
speaking, larger minimum groups sizes result in a better game, and I'm
delighted, Luigi, that you understand the importance of minimum group
size.  It seems that you get the game's essential character.  With
large minimum group sizes, the game feels like an unusual connection
game.

BUT, we should be talking about Yodd, instead of Odd, or watching
Christian and Mark beat each other about the head. Luigi: I haven't
been able to play it yet but I've been thinking about it a lot because
it's clever and simple and original. Can you shed some light on
strategy to give me a better feel for what it's about?
