I recently posted asking for opponents for e-mail Abalone games.  I got
several responses.  Except for one ongoing game, and one I'm about to set
up, I haven't gotten any replies once I actually set the games up.

If you are one of these people, please get back to me.  I'll give up after
another week or two.

If you reply, please tell me what you have received from me previously (if
anything).  Also please tell me what your prefered e-mail address is.

I'm especially disappointed that the experienced players did not get back
to me.  I'm running games, but I'm not playing any!
