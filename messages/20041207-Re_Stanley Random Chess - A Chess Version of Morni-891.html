STANLEY RANDOM CHESS F.A.Q.

WHAT IS STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
Stanley Random Chess (commonly designated as SR Chess) is: "an alternative
form of chess that predates regular chess, and offers greater complexity and
creativity."

HOW OLD IS STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
Technically speaking, SR Chess is not a chess variant, since purists allege
that modern chess is merely a simplified form and development from SR Chess.
With documented historical evidence dating back to the early English
monarchy, SR Chess claims to be one of the original sources of "Common
Chess", which SR Chess enthusiasts refer to somewhat contemptuously as
Simplified SR Chess.

WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
Even those who contest its historical claim to primacy must concede that
Stanley Random Chess appears to be a more complex and challenging game, with
much more scope for creativity and imagination. Despite its name, SR Chess
is certainly not random, but is carefully regulated by a well-established
and internationally-adopted set of rules which function alongside the rules
for Simplified SR (Common) Chess. Consequently SR Chess has less legal moves
than Common Chess, but is also less burdened by the need to memorize opening
theory, with a genuine focus on creative and imaginative play. Sadly,
despite its alleged antiquity, for centuries it has suffered under a cloak
of secrecy. Now that SR Chess is being rediscovered and regaining
popularity, it may well also be the future of chess.

WHAT ARE THE RULES OF STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
The rules are the same as Simplified SR (Common) Chess, with the addition of
some rules governing move sequences and board patterns. These rules are too
complex to summarize, and are subject to local variations, but new players
will notice two main differences from Simplified SR (Common) Chess:
1. As a result of the additional unique rules governing move sequences and
board patterns, approximately 50% of Common Chess moves are illegal in SR
Chess, accounting for the somewhat strange and apparently random moves at
times.
2. After move 30, the game enters VH Conditions (VollenHauser Sudden Death
Principle), and the game can come to a sudden end if the right
pattern/sequence is obtained, the winner being the person with the most
material (a "Forced Inferior Material Resignation", or Forced IMR).
SR Chess enthusiasts typically provide extensive analysis and commentary of
games in progress, so generally it does not take long for dedicated
newcomers to get a good feel for the game and its rules by observing
experienced players.

WHERE CAN I PLAY STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
Although a good grasp of the rules can take time to master, the
correspondence chess server SchemingMind.com has obtained a XML SRC rule
parser from the ISRCA (International Stanley Random Chess Association) which
is interfaced with the official ISRCA database, and uses a special algorithm
to automatically replace any illegal moves with the nearest equivalent legal
move. The apparent "randomness" of these transposed moves can be initially
perplexing to novices, but it enables new players to enjoy playing SR Chess
without requiring a complete mastery of the rules. SchemingMind.com is
currently the only correspondence chess server where SR Chess can be played.

HOW CAN I LEARN STANLEY RANDOM CHESS?
The best method for learning SR Chess is to observe experienced players
playing the game, or to play it online with the benefit of the innovative
technology provided by the SchemingMind.com chess server that corrects
illegal moves. SR Chess is not for everyone, but it certainly recommends
itself on account of its historical claim and its creative play. But don't
take my word for it, to understand the secrets and attractions of SR Chess,
you must really see and play it for yourself.
