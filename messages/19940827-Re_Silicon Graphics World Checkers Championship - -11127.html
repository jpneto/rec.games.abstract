Your sharp reasoning and the overwhelming evidence you have presented below
have in fact convinced me that Computer Checkers has nothing to do with 
Computer Chess. And even if there were some relevance, as you have correctly 
pointed out, rec.games.chess, the newsgroup for chess and computer chess, 
would not be the appropriate forum for discussions on this matter.

I humbly apologize for trying to defend some informative (although clearly
inappropriate) posts on the results of the human-machine checkers world
championships.

I will refrain from posting any further comments on the charter of 
rec.games.chess.
In particular not to rec.games.abstract and cs.ualberta.general.

Wrong. RGC has a charter and this charter does not include checkers. At the

checkers discussion group. Please don't try to rationalize cross-postings

several options: create a discussion group or form a private discussion group.
The latter was done in the case of the CBUFF utilities, clearly it would not
have been fair to the RGC readership to heap all the CBUFF discussions on them.

My rather caustic response was entirely appropriate because these checkers
posters displayed a blatant disregard for the charter of this newsgroup. The
last time a checkers thread emerged the checkers posters were politely asked
to move the thread elsewhere (not by myself). Maybe if I would have at least
seen some indication that an attempt was made to seek an appropriate channel
for these checkers postings I would not have become so irritated. My apologies
to the usual chess posters/readers on RGC for having to endure this, but none

You have wasted an estimated 500 keystrokes on this paragraph. You would have
