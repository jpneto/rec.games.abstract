It's incredibly frustrating to me that 90% of the posts here (and
other places) are personal attacks that have nothing to do with game
design.  What's so hard about restricting your posts to a discussion
of games on their merits?  How come there are so many impossibly
sensitive egos wrapped up in an endeavour for which the stakes could
not possibly be smaller?  If there's an activity with less cosmic
significance that abstract game design I don't know what it is.

Behaving well is soooo trivial.  It boggles my mind that we don't do
it.  Just ask yourself if the post you're about to write will be
helpful to someone.  If not, don't post.

Just doing a cost-benefit analysis here Nick. Mark Steere attacks
anyone and everyone without being provoked and I attack Mark
exclusively. It seems worth it to me seeing since I find it
entertaining too. It's not like if Mark makes a thread about how one
of your games is bullshit and I come in and defend you, the content of
the site goes down the tubes, so I figure "What the Hell". I am sorry
for implicating you in my rants though. I thought I had the ability to
delete posts here, because under more options there's a "remove"
option and this appeared to be removing my posts from the site since I
can't see the posts I did this with any longer.
