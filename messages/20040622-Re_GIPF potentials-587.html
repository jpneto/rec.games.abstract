<br>I've played Gipf with Zertz potentials, but only once, and only with 
three potentials per player. I believe more are recommended to get 
the full effect of their use.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>If yes what did you think was the impact of the potentials to the game?
<br></blockquote>
<br>The potential to jump definitely gave basic Gipf more (and more 
interesting) tactical possibilities than the usual place and push.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Have you combined the games with the potentials?
<br></blockquote>
<br>The one time I played Gipf with Zertz potentials, we did not enforce 
playing games of Zertz in order to use or prevent their use. But 
obviously, integration would definitely make for a longer Gipf game.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Did you think the dimensions of the game were altered in any way?
<br>Did you get a more tactical game? Did you get more satisfaction?
<br></blockquote>
<br>John, I would recommend you check out the Yahoo group dedicated to 
the Gipf project for more opinions.
