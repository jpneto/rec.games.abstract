If you like 3 games and think all of the other ones suck
equally then you're giving points pretty arbitrarily to the
other games.  From a voters perspective it might make
more sense to order the games that you like and then just
not list the other games.

Now you've got the same problem you were trying to solve by switching to the
list system.  One judge can corrupt the contest by voting 10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.

How about this?  Each judge must pick his top three games, in order, which
games are then awarded 3, 2, and 1 points, respectively.

Btw, if there is a tie, so what?  It's not like there's an indivisible prize
riding on this.  Ties are abhorrent in games of course, but not necessarily
in game contests.

This is my response from Prof Dee
....she answers so quickly... this is great :)

"Part of the problem is that you have only five judges - normally I'd
recommend the PR-STV voting system (ask Dec about it, it's the Irish
voting system). If you are only concerned with the top 3 games, the
quota would be too difficult to reach!

My recommendation would be to have a run-off situation. Have people
rank the games. Count how many times each game makes the top 3. The
games that are in the top 3 most frequently are then the "top 3"
games. Then give the list to the voters again and have them rank only
these games. I'd then give 5 points for every top rank, 3 points for
every 2nd rank and 1 point for every 3rd rank. Add up the ranks given
to each game and award the 1,2,3 positions on the basis of how many
points each gets."

I'm liking this.  Any thoughts?
