I dimly recall the Chess rating system: If player A is ranked 100 points
higher than player B, player A has a 75% chance of winning the game. Or
something like that.

Bill Robertie answered essentially this question in an old issue of
Inside Backgammon.  He listed the number of "skill differentials" where
one skill differential corresponds to a 75% probability of the stronger
player winning (which equates to the 100 point rating difference you
describe).  He lists the differentials between "world champion" and
"absolute beginner".  We are supposed to consider that the games are
played under reasonable conditions (e.g. the backgammon statistic
shows the result for a relatively long match that might be found in
a tournament, while the go result might be for a single game, to
account for the fact that a single backgammon game is much shorter
than a game of go).

  Go         40
  Chess      14
  Scrabble   10
  Poker      10
  Backgammon  8
  Draughts    8
  Blackjack   2
  Craps       0.001
  Lotteries   0.0000001
  Roulette    0

No.

People have tried, but I think the results need to be taken with a
large grain of salt.  For instance, we must note that we are measuring
the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>population<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (of players), not the game.  Games that have been
extensively studied will surely exhibit a wider range of player
abilities than obscure games with few players.  Similarly, games where
humans require a great deal of experience to play well will be
overrated.  Another problem is that the world champion defeating an
absolute beginner with high probability does not imply the game is
"deep".  For instance, it is relatively simple to play Nim perfectly;
if Nim were played in tournament conditions (first to 50?) then surely
a perfect Nim player would defeat an absolute beginner with
probability at least 0.95, thus earning Nim 2 or more skill
differentials in the table above, surpassing Blackjack.  But is Nim a
"deeper" game than Blackjack?  Arguable, but I certainly don't think
so.  Getting sillier, playing the game of putting two people on a
see-saw and seeing which end goes up would probably rate very highly
on the list above, but can hardly be considered skillful/deep/what
have you.

Prof. Elo is reported to have argued that his rating system measured
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>competitive ability<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rather than skill, and I agree that it is
excellent for that.  What we have been doing here is measuring the
range of (human) competitive ability in various activities.

Cheers,
Gary.
