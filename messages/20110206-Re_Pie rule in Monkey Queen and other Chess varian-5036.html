Conclusion:  pie rule works for hex, there are no problems with it,
and it in fact benefits the game more than just balancing it

Example 2:  Pie rule in chess
1.  Without pie rule, white has a significant advantage (55%), with
pie rule, white should be able to create a balanced game (50%), though
with no control over the distribution of those 50% (50.5-51% may be
possible with black getting complete control over the draw rate)
2.  Draws are possible in chess (at 40 moves in 2 hours at the top
level of play in match play, the draw rate is just over 50%, it is
under 50% in tournament play, or under the top level, or at shorter
time controls), Attack and defense are seperate (it is possible for a
player to have an unstoppable win and still lose)
3.  Without pie rule, e4, d4, c4, and Nf3 are considered the good
first moves, accounting for a large variety of play.  With pie rule,
d3 would probably be used over half the time (other canidates are f4,
which is good if you are playing for a win, but badly unbalanced in
favour of black, and b3 which is also defensive).
4.  there is such a thing as a bad move, thus any move that has no
positive impact would be worse than no move at all.  Thus all moves
must play off of the previous moves.
5.  The game offers no obvious balancing alternatives (other than
match play).

Conclusion:  Without pie rule, you score 55% as white (equivalent of
40elo), both players have control of what style they play in and the
draw rate is kept to 50% at most.  With the pie rule, white would
probably score about 50.5% as white, be forced to play defensivly, and
the draw rate would fluctuate between 50%-80% (depending on how black
wanted to play).  The extra draw rate and lowered variety of play
would not be worth the balance gained.

(i could go on about how it is interesting in go, but not enough that
i would overturn komi, or how it would make shogi boring by cutting
options without adding anything, but i'll cut that for brevity)
