You are perfectly right! Will try not to discriminate little-S in future... :)

Very good.   The S4-liberation society will be pleased.    :)

Well, I found my scribblings, and checked them as best may be,
and found the following, if you (or elseone) should want to check.

There are indeed exactly 6 null hexominos; the 8 you had with the 2 mistakes
removed.  These things must be on the net somewhere, but I also found...

1 hexomino  with Grundy number 2;
3 hexominos with Grundy number 3;
6 hexominos with Grundy number 4;
19 hexominos with Grundy number 6.

None with G-number 1 or 5, and the unique number 2 is the six-block.

 Therefore, when restricting the
maximum number of squares to be added to two, only even zero
polyominos will be created (of course, one can then as well restrict the
addition rule further by stating that exactly two squares need to be added). 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In fact I misread your original post on this as follows - that in the build-up
ANY polyomino can be added (as long as it has at least one edge in contact).
That may be too liberal, but if it were that any <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>line<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> polyomino could be
added, then the build-up and removal phases would be exactly symmetrical.
I think this would be the preferred and neatest option.   :)

BTW - I really <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>love<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> your idea of using a build-up phase as the preferred
form of equalization.  Brilliant.  This can obviously be applied to ANY
subtractive CGT game, such as Nim.  I wonder if it can apply to other
sorts of games as well?  It is not unlike the "adoption" equalizer
of Unlur and similar games.   Very high-tension!


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
So, yes you are right- odd zero polyominos likely do exist,
but they can't be reached in the build-up phase.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Then this would no longer apply, with strip-addition.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Do you have "Winning Ways"? All four volumes? 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, though it's two volumes for me, each having 2 divisions.

In fact I have a very special copy.  A late colleague of mine visited Conway 
in Cambridge, and after a chat offered to buy them, as he had a little supply
in his office.  Conway offered to flip coins for them, my colleague to toss 
three coins. If all turned up heads he would get them for free, otherwise
he would pay 8/7 of the price (the fair amount).  My colleague accepted,
tossed, and lost, and duly paid up.  Conway signed the books for him as well.

When he died I inherited them.  So he paid extra, and I paid nothing!
[Except the life of my colleague, which I would far rather have.  :-(  ]

So I have a signed (and overpaid-for) copy of the books!   Ta-Dah!!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I read quite some positive remarks about these books. 
They cost a little fortune with Amazon.co.uk. Yet worth the buy?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

They are colloquially known on this group as "the bible", and accurately so.
A must for serious CGT gamers, though library access is probably good enough.


Finally, just to wind things up, I believe I've found a null heptomino.
(I know you retracted your comment, but here it is anyway.)
I found it not by searching through all 109 (!) of them, but by trying
to build it up while avoiding the six null hexominos.   Here it is...

I dare say there are a few others too.
