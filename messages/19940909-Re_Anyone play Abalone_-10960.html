Abalone is a great game.

I played some Abalone, but stopped because I couldn't find much
clues about strategy, tactics, etc. I like to know what I am doing :-)
My friends and I figured out that it's wise to keep ones marbles
connected. That helps not to lose, but if both players play like this
games become slow and boring.

Are there any books about Abalone?
Or could people post their ideas about strategy?

OK, I'll give it a try.
Keeping your marbles connected is important, but getting a good
center position with a group of marbles also is.
The basic offensive strategy is trying to break up your opponents
marbles in at least two groups, and then keep the smaller group
separated and pushed aside with as large a group of your marbles
as you can.
I believe the position of your marbles (more to the center = better)
is even more important than keeping them connected.
And yes, when both players follow a defensive strategy,
the games can get slow.
