Two - most game championships can be edited into small packages.  The
TV coverage of the Scrabble U.S. Open lasts one hour, as does the
National Geographic Bee; the Scripps National Spelling Bee's finals
run a little longer than two hours on TV, even though it is a two-day
event.  You can't cover the world chess championship like this.

Also note the Fischer-Spassky match had a fixed 24-game limit.  I
think the next few were "first to X wins", which means that they would
have no idea how many weeks it would last.  It's hard to find TV time
under these conditions.

Why couldn't you do a time compress edit on chess matches and also not
have chess matches split a draw 1/2-1/2 and then have highest score
after a fix number of games?

Even run Speed Chess as a possibility as a way to get chess on TV.
Why not something?

Chess is inherently a slow game. The pace is much too slow to be
interesting to the typical TV audience.

If you speed it up, either by taping it and editing out the think
time, or by making it speed chess to begin with, the audience will
never follow what's going on. They'd have a hard enough time even if
it were slow and with someone explaining.
