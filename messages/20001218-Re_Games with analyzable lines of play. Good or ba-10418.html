For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.

In Go, any advice to beginners about the opening, beyond "don't put your
stones next to each other nor very near the edge of the board", is
superfluous.  Studying openings is pointless until you have a fair
understanding of tactics and some understanding of strategy. 

Yet weak players buy books on openings, study them, and fail to
understand the meaning behind the moves that we learn.  This does not
improve our game.  It looks as if we do it because we enjoy it, though I
suspect that most of us don't enjoy it.
