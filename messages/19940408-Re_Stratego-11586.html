] To all people who know the game Stratego
] 
] To get my Masters Degree at the University in Amsterdam, I have to
] implement a Stratego-playing program. I have some questions involving
] the game of Stratego.
] 
] 1. In Holland Stratego is a well-known game. How is the game known in
]    your country.
] 
] 2. Do you know any Stratego-playing programs which play reasonably
]    strong and how strong do they play. I have some programs written for
]    the PC, but they play poorly, although the graphic part is made 
]    professionally. They also don't play honest, because they make use
]    of the fact that the player has to give his arrangement to the computer
]    in order to display this arrangement on the screen. They use the
]    this knowledge for example to avoid the bombs.
] 
] 3. Do you know any literature about the topic Stratego.
] 
] 4. Is there a kind of club in which Stratego-players are joined, or
]    is there something as a championship.

It's sold as a children's/family game here. It is sold in a lot of places.
Occasionally it is advertised on TV.
I have found that the game strongly favors defending rather than attacking.
When both players feel this way the game is unplayable. This may have something
to do with why the game isn't treated that seriously (at least by the game
players I know).
