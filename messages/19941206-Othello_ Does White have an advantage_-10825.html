I've been seeing some rather disturbing trends in some VERY limited data 
points that I've been measuring with my program, Keyano.

The 1993 Waterloo CSC Computer Othello Tournament Final had six programs 
which were all fairly even in terms of performance.  White took 25.5 out of 
30 possible points in the round robin event.

A Japanese experiment, mentioned in a recent issue of Othello Quarterly, was
reportedly run by forcing White to obtain 35 or more discs to get a victory. 

Keyano has exhibited a rather alarming preference for playing White against
other computer programs of similar strength, losing almost every game with 
Black and winning almost every game with White.

So, I pose the question:  Does White have the advantage in a game of Othello?
Or does Black receive enough of an edge to destroy the usefulness of White's 
last move?
