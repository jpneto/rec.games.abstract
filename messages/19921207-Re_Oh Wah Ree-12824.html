Hi.  My roommate has a game called Oh Wah Ree.  It has twelve pots
arranged in a circle, and lots of little stones.  It also has some
(maybe four) other holes in the middle.  She used to enjoy it years
ago, but can't remember how it's played, and doesn't have the rules.
She would also love to hear about the origins and history of the
game.  Any information on either of these aspects would by highly
appreciated.

Your girlfriend has a game that everyone else knows as Awari! It is a
game of african origin where it is played extensively in the western
sub-saharan area.  A similar game is played elsewhere called Kalah (and
other variants thereof.  Kalah is played by somewhat different rules
from Awari and has two extra pots.

Rules.

(1) put 4 stones in each of the twelve outer pots. leave the other pots
empty (they are used only for storage of "won" stones).

(2) decide who goes first.

(3) player chooses a pot on her side and picks up all the stones.
Beginning with the next pot anti-clockwise player places one stone from
hand into each pot.  If the last stone in hand is played into an empty
pot, players turn ends.  If last stone in hand is played into a
non-empty pot, all the stones in that pot are then picked up and the
same distribution as before commences with the next pot anti-clockwise.
You cannot <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>begin<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> with a pot on the other players side of the board,
but one can <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>continue<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> an on-going move from the other side.

If <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> pot has exactly 4 stones in it after the play of a stone, then
all 4 stones are removed and become the "won" stones of the player.  If
the last stone in hand is played into a pot making 4 in the pot, the
stones are remove, become "won" and the turn ends.

Play continues until one player cannot make a move because they have no
stones on their side.

Stones not "won" remain in the board and do not count to the score.

Winner determined by "won" stones.

Some infinite moves are possible

eg if the board looks like (I think)

0 1 2 0 1 2

1 0 1 1 3 1

and the player commences with the pot of three stones.
