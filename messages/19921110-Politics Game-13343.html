A friend of mine told me about a Politics Game which sounds exciting.

---

Everyone starts with a certain amount of money.  There is a big pot of
money which represents `nature', which yields up natural resources.

Each turn, nature antes $1 per player into a kitty.  

The players take turns bidding on the money in th kitty.

Highest bid gets the kitty, but <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>every<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player has to pay nature the
amount of their highest bid, whether they get the kitty or not.

After one hour, everyone stops playing and counts their money.

---

    The thing you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>don't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> want to do is get involved in a bidding war,
because hten everyone loses.  If the kitty has $10 in it, and I bid $9,
the guy who bid $8 is going to be upset---if he lets me have the pot, I
have a profit of $1 and he has a loss of $8.  So perhaps he can cut his
losses by bidding $10.  Then if I let him have the pot he still breaks
even.  But that would give me a loss of $9.  So perhaps I can cut my
losses by bidding $11; then if I get the pot I lose only $1 instead of
$9.  You see where this is going; what a disaster.

    So clearly the best thing to do is agree with everyone that first
everyone will let one player will get the pot for $1, and then everyone
will let another player get the whole pot for $1, and so on.
Cooperation is much more productive and everyone wins.

    Unfortunately, as the clock starts to run down, someone will realize
they are going to get shorted, and that they can sabotage the
cooperation and get the pot for themselves by bidding higher on the last
pot.  They may even be able to argue the other players into going along
with them.

    But now you know this, you realize that there is a substantial
advantage in being the first betrayer...
