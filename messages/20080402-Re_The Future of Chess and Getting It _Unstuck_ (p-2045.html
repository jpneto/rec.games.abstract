Christian Freeling had a game called "Grand Chess" before you did.
For reference:

There is also Ministers Chess that has a copyright with that name.
Please change the name, and allow the variant community to evaluate
it.  Also, get ahold of Zillions and run your game in it, to see how
it plays.  Your desire to keep calling it what someone else has isn't
going to facilitate its adoption.

I will say, keep in mind that merely doubling everything doesn't make
a game better.  Position, balance, protecting pawns, structure, etc...
all count.  And, as I had posted in an earlier post, a game like
Millennium Chess does nearly what you want to do, but it also happens
to have balance to it.  It is double chess, where the sides mirror
each other.

If you are serious about wanting it considered, do a Zillions
adaptation of it, and have the computer play itself like 100 times or
so, to see how lines play out, etc...
