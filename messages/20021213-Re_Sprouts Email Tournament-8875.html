I don't think that's true.  I think that if your opponent plays QxQch,
and your choices are to play KxQ or to move the king away, you can
usually make that choice without any "exhaustive tree of analysis".

I went on to say that in practice we always combine both methods. 
You're just making my point.

Actually, no.  Your opponent might have an overwhelming material
advantage even after you take back.  There could be a position in
which moving your king without taking back discovers check and blocks
one of your opponent's retreat squares, and this move could be a
winner.  A tree of analysis is needed, and a strategical evaluation of
the entire position is needed.

Humans can often size things up so quickly and effortlessly that it is
easy to lose sight of what they are doing, even when we are the humans
doing it.  But think about how computers play.  They always do a tree,
and they always do a total strategical evaluation of each end position
that does not get automatically pruned off by the alpha beta
algorithm.
