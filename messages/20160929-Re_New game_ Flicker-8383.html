Luis you are deeply dumb.
You and others are working on connection games for almost 10 years if not more.
Have you ask yourself about kinds of other pieces than stones? have used color system (I have one very sophisticated that makes the original Hex a childish game)? Have you try directions other than north-south and east-west?
Have you complex boards with changing configuration as part of players strategies? and so on.

Sometimes I feel very angry when I see inventing in fact the same game with new package and new name. The game play is NOT CHANGED AT ALL!!! 
You just trying to fuck the flies as we say in french.
Go play my solitaire game Mobius! I have another complicated variant for 2 (my rules are simple but the play strategy is too complex to handle except if you are a genius).
