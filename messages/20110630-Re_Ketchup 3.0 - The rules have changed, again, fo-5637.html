I lately discovered how to make Ketchup, one of my best games, better.
So now I'm posting my second major revision in as many years. First
I'll describe the new rules, such as they are, and then discuss why
Ketchup warms my pants and why I'm so happy about the new version.
Here we go:

Ketchup is a game for 2 players played with red and green stones on a
hexhex5 board.

Terminology
*Group - a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board.
*Group Size - the number of stones that a group contains. The smallest
possible group has a size of 1.
*To Drop - to place a stone on any empty space.

Rules
*The board begins empty. One player owns the red stones and the other
owns the green stones.
*Red begins by dropping a single stone.
*Then, starting with Green, the players take turns. On his turn, a
player drops 2 stones.
*When a group of at least size 2 has formed, the nature of the turns
change. From then on, on your turn, if your largest group is smaller
than your opponents largest group, you must drop 3 stones. Otherwise
you must drop 2 stones.
*The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest
group wins.  If the players largest groups are the same size, compare
their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which
aren't the same size.  Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.

Note
*Record the size of each players largest groups on a sheet of paper,
as theyre formed.  This will make it easier to think. A PDF is
provided at the link at the top of this post, for paper and pencil
play; it contains scoring columns where players can mark their largest
groups.

What's the big deal?
If you're not me, maybe nothing, but I'm me so here I go
pontificating. Ketchup was one of my better games even in its earlier
incarnations.  I was trying to design a game which is short,
intuitive, unintimidating, addictive and deep.  The difficulty with
these criteria is that the last one is often in conflict with the
first four.  Deep games tend to be hard to figure out, and that
quality can make them intimidating and not-addictive.  But Ketchup
avoids that trade-off better than most of my other games. There are
two key reasons for this I think:

*Negative Feedback: the leading player plays fewer stones than the
trailing player.  If players play quasi-randomly, as new players tend
to do, the game often turns into a nail-biter because the trailing
player tends to catch up. Mind you, because this is a perfect
information game, it's not true negative feedback in the sense that it
makes a weak player stronger.  In fact, the main strategic dilemma of
the game is in deciding when to take the lead and when to fall back,
and skill and experience count for everything.

*New players start having strategic ideas quickly.  The reason this
happens is that the win condition, "build the biggest group", has a
natural, intuitive quality that our brains can easily generate
thoughts around. So interesting ideas come easily.  Importantly, these
ideas are interesting even though they're nowhere near the final word
on good play.  The game is indeed pretty deep, and with practice you
realize your initial ideas were wrong and you discard them for
others.  I've come to see this dynamic as key to creating games which
are both deep and fun: you must be able to think of exciting
possibilities right when you start playing (because that's fun), and
yet those ideas must turn out to be wrong (because that's deep).

But why did you change the rules?
The last incarnation of Ketchup had a niggling issue which had irked
me for a year. There was a rule prohibiting the players' largest
groups from being the same size at any time during the game. The rule
existed to ensure that the game would never end in a tie, but it
created situations where certain moves were illegal. These
restrictions were an extra cognitive burden that broke the flow of
play without contributing to quality of play. So I started thinking
about how to avoid them. After a while, I discovered a win condition
that avoids ties more naturally, and which allowed me to drop the move
restrictions.  Two unexpected and happy byproducts of the new win
condition was that it shortened the rules about about 20%, made them
more intuitive, and I daresay made the game deeper without making it
more intimidating or less fun.

My rule is: if at the end of the game, the players' largest groups are
the same size, you compare their second largest groups to see whose is
bigger, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren't the same
size.  The player with the larger of the two wins.  The cool thing
about this rule is that, as long as there are an odd number of spaces
on the board, there can never be a tie.  In a list of the players'
groups, ordered by size, you will always find at least one mismatched
pair. I love that.

Another thing I love about this rule is that if you have two players
of equal skill, it won't be extremely uncommon for the players'
largest groups to be the same size at the end of the game.  The new
rule creates a whole new subgame in this situation where the players'
second- and third- largest groups matter.  So you have to "play the
whole board" more in order to win in those situations.  But this only
happens in <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> tense games that go neck and neck to the end.  So
this new subgame comes up only when you're already having a riveting
experience.  That's a perfect time for extra depth to rear it's
head.

But: I reserve the right to be wrong about everything. That's the
delight and frustration of abstract games - they try to hide their
true nature from you.

Hi Nick,

I actually had to go to iGGC to see what had changed. Somehow I had
this 'if equal, consider the next until' already seen before in ...
(can't remember just now) and it actually simplifies everything quite
naturally. The rule as the game intended it, so to speak. Congrats, it
looks like a very good game now and you're considering the right
criteria. Not everybody always does :)

I'll make the graphics for a mindsports version, just in case. Tthe
game certainly would make a fine addition, but we also have a lot of
intended improvements awaiting our attention. So it won't be in the
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> near future.
