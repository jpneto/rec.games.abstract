Pacru is unusual in having both pieces and tiles and a strong interaction
between the two elements.  At the Mind Sports Olympics in Manchester 2003 it
was well received by Chess, Go &amp; Othello players.

Pacru will be released this August in time for the 8th Mind Sport Olympics
and will be on display at Essen. The first manufactured version will be
expensive but for those using windows software and IE 5.5 or above, you can
play on-line or off-line for free (no registration - just 4 questions you
can ignore when you get to the site for the first time).

We are looking for
a) new players - and this is the first on-line place we have approached.
b) feedback on the game as software (still in its infancy)
c) reviews/comments on the game as a new member of the abstract game family

Thanks

Mike Wellman
