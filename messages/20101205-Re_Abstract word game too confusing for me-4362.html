I'm sure I could convince at least Aaron Dalton to program the game.
It'd be like "hey Aaron, how about programming this game". It's
trivial. What's he going to say, "no"? I'd be surprised to say the
least.

lol, Oh sure!  Especially since you put it like that!  Make sure you let
Aaron know how lucky he'll be to have a Corey Clark game on his server! lol

Oh yeah, because he's so lucky to have, instead of Hex, a game that's
not only 100% isomorphic to Hex but also harder to visualize. Jesus
talk about a shitty deal. And you talk about lack of professional
disrespect? I couldn't think of a more textbook case of professional
disrespect. The abomination known as Slash is an insult to a truly
canonical abstract. It's a Stalinist revision of history in which you
outright stole Hex, complicated it unnecessarily and put your name on
it. Cameron Browne even used Slash in a diagram in his book Hex:
Making the Right Connections I guess he missed the untapped reservoir
of fame and fortune in Slash.  I don't have to ponder why it's called
Slash, I'd want to do that to my wrists too if I did something so
shameful.

I don't need to email Aaron warning him about you.  You vastly underestimate
the readership of rec.games.abstract, and, a not unrelated quantity, the
magnitude of your buffoonery.

Oh yeah Steere I remember now, you got that whole legion of undead
cyber soldiers just waiting to be mobilized in the culmination of your
master-plot to take over the world ROFL

Another case of lack of professional respect. Nothing new here folks.
