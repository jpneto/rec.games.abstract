)As i see it, there are about (16 choose 4) * (12 choose 4) positions, since
)it is relevant who is to move as well, which looks a lot more than 400 (it's
)around 900000). As soon as anyone can explain movement (haven't found it on
)web page) I will program it in Zillions to try.

This is second hand knowledge, but this is how I know the rules:

4x4 board, initial position is each colour occupying a diagonal.  The
players take turns moving one piece horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
but moves are restricted to those that 'end' against another stone, or the
edge.  That is, you move a piece in one direction until you hit something
and then you stop.
The game ends when one player makes a square of his four stones or places his
stones on the four corners of the board (in which case that player wins) or
when one player uses three stones to trap a stone belonging to the other
player, in which case the other player wins. (which is only possible in a
corner.  Trapping a stone using all four is ok, as you have to move one the
next turn.)

Note: I'm not 100% sure about this, expecially the diagonal bit.  But I
think so, otherwise the 'trapped in a corner' bit would be stupid.
