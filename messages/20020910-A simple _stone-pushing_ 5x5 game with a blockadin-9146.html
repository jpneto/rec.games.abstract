I've read about the trivial games Pong Hau K'i and Mu Torere and I
decided to come up with a slightly more complicated (and therefore
more challenging) variant of these games and I'd like to know what you
guys think about it.

This game is played on a 5x5 square board with 12 black and 12 white
stones initially arranged like this:

_ B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W
B W B W B
W B W B W
where here, _ means the square is empty. At any stage during the game,
only one stone can occupy any given square and there are no captures
or introduction of new stones. During each turn by black, he has to
move one of his black stones to a empty square adjacent to it (only
orthogonally, not diagonally) and similarly for white. If one of the
players run out of legal moves, that means he has lost. Otherwise,
once it becomes obvious the game would simply continue forever (in
practice, we could impose the rather artificial rule that if the game
doesn't end after let's say 200 moves, it's a draw), it's declared a
draw. From the initial setup, black moves first.

At first glance, this game looks rather trivial, and it looks as if
there ought to be a simple strategy to draw no matter what the
opponent does or for one side to force a win, but after playing a few
games with it and analyzing it a bit, it definitely seems more
complicated than that. Of course, maybe I'm just being stupid and one
of you can come up with a simple strategy or simple analysis of this
game which would leave me wondering why I didn't think of it earlier
in hindsight.

Anyway, I'd like to know your thoughts and analyses of this game. The
branching factor of this game is always between 1 to 3, so maybe it's
easy to write a program to solve this game. If it turns out this game
is actually too trivial after all, how about a different arrangement
of stones as the initial setup (something I'm also currently
experimenting with) or a larger board size?
