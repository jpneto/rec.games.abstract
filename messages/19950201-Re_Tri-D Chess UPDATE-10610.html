    An open letter to Trekkies, Trekkers, Tri-D Chess enthusists,
shareware authors, professional writers, fanfic and filk writers

details my legal disagreement with the Franklin Mint.  If after
reading this you find that you side with me against the monolithic
forces of American marketing, please express your opinion in a
short, POLITE letter to:
    Mr. Thomas Durovsik, President, The Franklin Mint, Franklin

                         Just the Facts:
    I don't know if this is Way Off Topic here, but from the base
title, I figured you'd have an interest in this:
    Recently, the Franklin Mint sold a $225+ version of the old
TREK's Tri-D chess set.  If you bought one, please note that the
sketchy rules with that flashy chess board were written by myself
nineteen years ago, and plagurized by the Franklin Mint.  As I will
explain, I have no recourse but to take this to you, the people, as

the Law will not grant me a fair solution.  The powerful forces of

quietly into the night."  I don't care what the law says; but I
know what is right.
    From the spring of 1976 to the fall of that year, I
corresponded with Franz Joseph, the gifted author behind Ballentine
Books STAR FLEET TECHNICAL MANUAL, concerning the rules for Star
Trek's Tridimensional Chess.  His "bare bones" outline of the game,
as depicted in the manual, contained nothing more than brief hints
as to how the game was played.  It came out at the time that no
real rules had been written.  Accepting the challenge, I took on
the project.
    In late 1977, my article on STAR TREK's Tridimensional Chess
was published nationally in the then popular STAR TREK Giant Poster
Book.  It outlined the rules, included board diagrams and some
fictional history for the game.  It was a hit for the folks at the
poster book, and I got thanks from the magazine.  (Now out of
business.) I even have a 1978 letter from Gene Roddenberry's
secretary thanking me for writing the rules.
    I have revised and updated the rules several time in the
intervening years, vastly improving them over the ones the Mint
used, at times selling them through STARLOG magazine's classified
section.  I have corresponded with people in several states who
have built chess-boards from the construction details included in
my rules.   I know that at least two other people in the States
have worked on versions of the game, which is all well and good for
the exploration of the game's potential.
    So, understandably, I was concerned when I saw the chess board
featured in a recent OMNI magazine.  It was a stunning piece of
work...certainly, back in 1977, before the big SF boom, I would
have paid the big bucks to own one.  (As that was impossible, I had
to settle with building one.)  I had no concern with the board,
but was worried that the rules the Mint offered might be wholly or
in part based on my intellectual property.
    I requested a copy of the fancy rules, concerned that the Mint
might be using the old Posterbook rules, or the newer ones I wrote
later.  After stalling me for a month (assumedly to check the legal
position), I called the Mint and was connected with a Mr. Howard
Lucker in the legal department.  After many conversations and
calls, I was mailed a copy of their rules, to discover that except
for one paragraph, they were word for word the ones I wrote in
1978.  The ad has been repeated in STARLOG magazines, tabloid press
and other print media.  The Mint must have sold thousands of these
sets to Trek fans across the globe. It came out after several more
calls that a Franklin Mint staffer had seen a copy of my original
rules bootlegged at a Con, seen no copyright on them, and proposed
selling the chess board to his superiors.  Mr. Lucker at the Mint
described the rules as "not being an integral part" of their
product.  At that time, he offered to settle for a chess set and
future attribution if the set is re-released (an unlikely event.)
    For you legal buffs, my lawyer says that under the "Lanham
Act", a 1978 copyright law, I have a weak case.  (My rules were
published in December, 1977.  These 30 days mean the Mint has me
legally.)  I am the original author beyond dispute...they
intentionally used a document when they saw it had no copyright,
and have refused to pay me fair market value for the rules that
have paid them very nicely.  (Anyone who wants to fight this
probono is welcome to contact me.)   I have sunk $500 into this,
(plus phone calls!) and will not lose a penny more.  I'd rather
loose my cash honestly fighting them than to sign away for far less
than what I should be paid in a fair world.  Without your input,
the bad guys win, end of story.
    Please mail a letter supporting me against the marketing
machine.  If you own or plan to oneday own anything from the
Franklin Mint's elaborate line, mention that as well.  Thanks, and
God Bless.
