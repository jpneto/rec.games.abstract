That's a good point.  These "key elements" that purportedly "define

Abstract strategy games, are a subset of boardgames, so when you
attempt to define and list what is involved with them, you end up also
producing a taxonomy chart for all abstract strategy games.  By doing
this, you then can reduce what is or is not relevant to whether a game
is abstract or not.  This observation you made is a side-effect.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, it's not a "side-effect".  Peter Clinch made a perfectly valid
point, a point which I was only seconding, and which you still seem
not to have grasped.  Your document starts with this:

"[Key elements]
There are multiple key elements that define all abstract strategy
games. These elements are: "

Then everything in the document that follows this lead-in is a general
description of games, with nothing specifically about abstract games,
which totally doesn't make sense.  When you start out with a promise
to list the key elements of abstract games then presumably there will
be at least <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>something<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> in the document specifically pertaining to
abstract games which there isn't.  To dismiss this point as a "side
effect" is to dismiss reality as a side effect, something that seems
to be happening with alarming frequency in these discussions.

The world at large isn't going to run off with your document and
bastardize it.  This is just the most well known place where people
come to discuss abstract games.  Here you'll get more and better
feedback than in the IAGO forums which hardly anyone visits.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

. . . bound what IAGO covers to go as far as including backgammon and
Kriegspiel, which do fall in the boundaries of what is acceptable.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I disagree with this.  I've only heard of Backgammon being excluded as
an abstract game because of its random element of dice.  I've never
heard of it being included as an abstract game.

The name of the organization is IAGO and should therefore concern
itself with abstract games.  That would indicate following commonly
accepted definitions and would preclude inventing your own definitions
such as "an abstract game can include random elements or hidden
information but not both".  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> heard that before you made it
up.

The two primary, completely objective criteria for determining what an
abstract game is are:
1) No random elements.
2) No hidden information.

In what's proving to be a difficult search for objectivity, these two
criteria are like diamonds.  When you take the liberty of combining
these two criteria in a mutually exclusive manner, you smash these two
diamonds with a hammer.

Why don't we preserve the integrity of the two diamonds and exclude
all games with random elements and all games with hidden information.
So we lose Backgammon.  So what?  Who gives a shit?  Everyone I've
heard of doesn't consider it to be an abstract game anyway.  So we
lose Kriegspiel.  Again, who really gives a shit?  We still have
hundreds of abstract games to deal with besides Backgammon and
Kriegspiel.

Here's the beauty of keeping these two objective criteria intact:
They knock out all designer games, all war games, all german games,
Carcasonne, Puerto Rico, Night of Dracula, and every game that has a
stack of shuffled action cards or character cards or whatever kinds of
cards there are.  Do you see the beauty in that, Rich?  Now we have a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>completely objective<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> means of excluding thousands of games that
don't belong.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
And the problem is that you rule out games that most people would
consider abstract strategy games, such as backgammon...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, no.  I've only seen Backgammon described as not being an
abstract game because of the dice.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

One thing that will look to come out of all this and the association
is a master list of abstract strategy games from all over the web,
which will act as a resource.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A master list is kind of like a master race.  It's not real
encouraging to those who aren't in it.  I can see the rational for
including games which have achieved some degree of popularity but this
excludes new games, such as Oust, which hardly anyone knows about.
You're not likely to cast a positive vote for a game you never heard
of.  This is not encouraging to designers who are hoping IAGO will
popularize their games, not just accept their games after they've
taken years to become popular with other means.
