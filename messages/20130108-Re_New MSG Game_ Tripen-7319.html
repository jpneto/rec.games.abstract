What reputation? lol  I know exactly what you're talking about.  On Halloween I told you that kids coming around for candy was exciting, meaning that my life is boring and this injects some excitement.  You bizarrely interpreted this as sexual excitement.  Once I realized that, I played it up and acted like I really was sexually excited by little kids in ghost costumes.  I was just fucking with you because you're a retard.  You want to post that?  Go ahead.  I'm not the least bit intimidated by lowlifes who mop bathrooms in the local porn theater.
