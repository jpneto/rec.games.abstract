<br><blockquote type=cite>While waking up this morning these rules came to me. I am curious if
<br>this game exists or not. It needs a name. As of now, it is called "The
<br>Single Line Game" (the name should be changed. I recall there is
<br>supposed to be a 1D Go type game. Maybe this is like it.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Some years ago Dan Glimne invented single-line Chess. The linear board 
consists of 18 alternating dark and light squares, starting with a black 
king on the dark square at one end, followed by black's queen, rook, 
light-square bishop, dark-square bishop, knight, pawn, then four empty 
squares, then white's corresponding pieces in reverse order with his 
king at the end.
<br>
<br>Pawns may advance two squares initially. Knights move either two or 
three squares ad lib, jumping if necessary. Bishops move only on squares 
of their own colour, completely ignoring those of the other. Kings move 
one or two squares. Castling is permitted, under normal restrictions, by 
simply changing places.
<br>
<br>When I described this in my Oxford History of Board Games ten years ago 
(pages 317 and 320) Glimne believed White had a forced win, and was 
awaiting proof. When I see him at Essen I'll check whether anyone has 
yet found it.
