I have only scanned over most of it, but I can't superficially see
anything that would rule out a lot of non-abstract games with a clear theme.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I had the same objection about themes being allowed.  In my mind, not
that I'm an authority on abstract games, but in my mind abstract games
are best defined by what they don't have: no random elements, no
hidden information (which would exclude simultaneous move games), and
(I always thought) no theme.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I had a discussion about abstract strategy games and excluding theme.
The problem ran into was that the definition of what is or is not
theme (see chess) ended up being so vague, it didn't make an effective
criterion.  Mark, I believe we debated this before with myself saying
no theme, and you arguing it was too vague of a criterion.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Now I've learned that there is some degree of consensus that abstract
games may be "lightly themed."  People who play lightly themed games
will tell you that the light theme has absolutely no bearing on the
gameplay and that such games are "essentially" abstract.  Still, I
have some difficulty letting go of my view of abstract games being
themeless, Reversi, Go, and Checkers being good examples.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A game like "Through the Desert" for example, is lightly themed.  By
not having theme there, and using other criterion, then one hopes what
a real abstract is can be concretely determined without having to
mention theme.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Everyone considers Chess to be an abstract game even though it has
kings, queens, knights, etc.  There is certainly a theme there at
least in the naming of the pieces but it's so superficial that it
obviously has no bearing on the gameplay, even to someone who has only
read the rules but never played.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I know with the definitions here more work will be done.  The
complexity of the rules and the interplay of theme, does need to
connect somehow here.  I am not exactly sure how to do it.

In the December issue of Games Magazine (which is due out on the
stands soon, and which features my game, Dipole [Sorry.  I really
tried to get through this without promoting myself...]) there are a
number of themed games in the "Abstract Games" section of their Top
100 board games list.  I unhesitatingly defer to the editors of Games
Magazine in the classification of games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I believe Games Magazine ends up being meant to sell commercial
products, which is part of a reason why I want a larger scale abstract
strategy set to get out there, so Games can have it in their top 100
list (this way Dipole gets recognized :-)).

I'll have to let Rich answer this for himself, but I would like to
second the question.  (Sorry Rich, but it's an obvious question and
one that will be asked again and again, Pete's being only the first
public instance.)  I can say that the AG document in question relates
to the new group IAGO (International Abstract Games Organization
[abstractgamers.org]), founded by Rich.  When IAGO was first proposed
as a "governing body" for abstract games I kind of bristled at that.
I've designed 13 (unthemed) abstract games over the past 15 years and
somehow in all that time I never had any desire to be "governed".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

IAGO is meant to represent and market abstract strategy games that
don't have any sort of association covering them.  The idea came out
of when I wanted to approach some organization like IAGO to promote my
designs for Stonehenge and then found such an organization doesn't
exist.  And "governing body" is meant to be a means by which to get
standards in place with such things as the name of chess variant
pieces and so on.  Organizations can govern things a lot of ways.  I
expect governing by concensus, the way Linux is run, and any open
standards organization would.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Standardizing and governing make sense for something like a Texas Hold
'em tournament in which you want everyone playing the exact same game,
or in which specific, allowable variations are enumerated. Reasons for
standardizing abstract games as a whole have as yet eluded me.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Holding tournaments is part of it.  The second part is to have a
sufficient robust set of definitions, so that what is covered doesn't
grow so large it ends up being some sort of Table Games association,
that ends up including the likes of Role-Playing games.  You end up
creating a slipperly slope if you don't get definitions out there.
Like, I had stated there should be backgammon considered, to which
someone then said Scrabble and Carcassonne should now be part of the
association.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Rich, before you invest a lot more time into the "what", you need to
seriously consider the "why".  If you can't produce a coherent
document explaining why abstract games need to be governed, terms like
"strand of reality" will forever be tossed about in reference to your
efforts.  When this whole topic was first broached a few weeks back, I
envisioned you as a character in a science fiction movie repairing
something outside the spaceship when something went horribly wrong.
The last you see of the character he's drifting off into the darkness
flailing his limbs and trailing a severed tether.

Again, sorry.  I'm having a little fun at your expense, but the
question remains valid.  Why?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why is laid out for multiple reasoned that have been stated and they
are good reasons.  Tournament play needs to be governed somehow, and
the way abstracts are today, they go out into the marketplace as
isolated games, most of which end up dying off or buried in a rulebook
somewhere.  In other words, lost.  Don't like governed, then go with
"coordinating body for all abstracts".
