I would be interested in hearing more about this project.  Maybe it
could help give birth to a Moratic Fantasy Chess player, that being
one who tries to play masterfully at fantasy chess in general.

There have been several books published in English containing brief
articles on strategy for popular commercial games, such as _The
Playboy Winner's Guide to Board Games_, and David Pritchard's
collection <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Games and Puzzles Book of Modern Board Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.

The Moratics Project is more ambitious.  The word "moratics" is
derived from Iain Banks's SF novel <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Player of Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.  Loosely
speaking, a "morat" is someone who attempts to develop mastership of
many games, and apply strategic knowledge gained in particular games
as widely as possible.  Similarly, our teams aims to discover and
publish "transversal lines of play", in other words, strategies and
tactics that can be applied to multiple games: board, card, whatever.

For example, consider the "fork" in Chess, wherein you attack two of
your opponent's pieces at once so that only one can escape.  This
tactic can not only be applied to other board games, such as Checkers
and Sid Sackson's game Focus, but can even be generalised to some card
games, in the sense that if you are skillful, you can create a
situation in which an opponent is forced to choose the lesser of two
evils when playing a card.  See the following web page for a good
example of what we are trying to do (albeit applied only to card
games), and the origin of the phrase "transversal lines of play":

  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pagat.com/strategy.html">http://www.pagat.com/strategy.html</a>

We are studying games at all levels of generalisation.  Some tactics,
such as forking, have very broad application; others apply only to
specific games or kinds of games.  Stratagems will be slotted into the
appropriate place in the project hierarchy, whether Games, Board
Games, Connection Games, or Hex (to use one example, and moving from
most abstract to most concrete).

Our book will be both more widely useful and more enduring than a book
of strategies for specific games.  It will be distributed freely on
the Web under something like the GNU Free Documentation License.
People will be able to read the book from their Web browsers, print
out their own copies, or obtain professionally-bound copies from a
print-on-demand publisher such as iUniverse.com.

As of May 2002, the Moratics Project is just beginning, so you can
have a major influence on how things develop.  To join the mailing
list, visit the following web page.  The archives can be browsed
freely without subscribing to the list.
