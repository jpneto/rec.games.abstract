This is an idea for a game. It's not perfect information as it
introduces some randomness with a 6-sided dice roll, and the random
board generation, but I could think of no better place to introduce
this logic puzzler.

This game would best be represented by a computer program, it is
rather complex otherwise. I call it THE CUBE (Off a sci-fi movie)
The game takes place on an 8x8 board. Each square of the board has
numbers from 2 to 12 on each of its 4 sides, and a second number from
1 to 6 on each side too.

So one square might have:
7:1(North side) 
5:4(West side) 
9:6(East side) 
3:4 (South side)

on its sides.

Each player moves a pawn freely about the squares, one square per move
per turn. They may instead alter either one of the second numbers, or
a pair of the first numbers(following 2 specific rules - explained
later) On the board are cubes - dice, with a face-up number for each
(from 1 to 6). Each cube rests within one chamber of the board,
filling that chamber completely. If a player is standing on a cube,
then they may spend their turn changing that cube's number directly(1
to 6).

After each player has made their turn's move, a dice is rolled off the
board.
IF a cube's face up # + the number rolled off board = one of the 4
1st-numbers around the square it is in, it moves in that direction.
Furthermore, the face-up number changes to that of the second digit.

EXAMPLE: There is a cube sitting in the square mentioned above.
(
7:1(North side) 
5:4(West side) 
9:6(East side) 
3:4 (South side)
 )

The face up number on this cube is 4.
IF the dice rolled off-board is 1, THEN
the total is 5, the cube moves one square West, and its number stays
4.
IF the dice rolled is 3, THEN
the total is 7, the cube moves North, and its number changes to 1.
IF the dice rolled is 5, THEN
the total is 9, the cube moves East, and its number changes to 6.
IF the number rolled is 2, 4, or 6, the cube does not move at all.
The cube cannot move south right now - 4 + (1 to 6) cannot add up to
3.

The same roll moves all cubes currently on the board.

Any pawn atop the cube when it moves, moves with the cube.

IF a cube rolls onto a player's pawn (a square occupied by a pawn
already) then the pawn is destroyed. (possible game loss)
IF a cube cannot move into another square because a cube is there, it
does not move, and shakes. Any pawns atop the cube are destroyed.
IF 2 cubes both want to move into the same square, neither moves.
IF a cube moves off the board, then it will remain off the board for
one turn, then return to the square it was on, randomized.

IF a pawn 'rides' a cube off the board, it escapes. This counts as a
point (victory) (whatever) it is then removed from the cube.

The rules to changing numbers: 

By changing the numbers on the board scrupulously, players can control
the cube flow.
 
The second number can be changed to any number from 1 to 6. You may
only change one side of the square at a time.

For the first number, only 2-12 is allowed. You must change 2 sides
simultaneously. Also, the total 'value' of the sides MUST add up to
16.

2, 12 - 1 point of 'value'
3, 11 - 2 points
4, 10 - 3 points
5, 9 - 4 points
6, 8 - 5 points
7 - 6 points

If it is any HIGHER or LOWER than 16, it is a failure (destroyed pawn,
or redo)
Also, while duplicates are allowed in the second number, there can be
no duplicates in the first numbers, or it is a failure.
As you can see, the demonstration square is safe.

7:1(North side) - 7 = 6 points
5:4(West side) - 5 = 4 points
9:6(East side) - 9 = 4 points
3:4 (South side) - 3 = 2 points

TOTAL is 16 points. This square is fair. 

For a turn, you could change the West side's second number to 2. Then
any cube that came up a total of 5 would roll West and adopt a 2.

Or you could change the North and South side to 4 and 6. 4 is a value
of 3, and 6, a value of 5, so the square still adds up to 16.

If you made both these changes, the square would read-

4:1(North side) - 4 = 3 points
5:2(West side) - 5 = 4 points
9:6(East side) - 9 = 4 points
6:4 (South side) - 6 = 5 points

TOTAL 16. Fair square. :-)

The arena may be filled with cubes. It is possible they are randomly
placed at the start, or they flow about the board from cube spawners
that create cubes when certain numbers get rolled from 1-6...

There may be 1 pawn, or many. They may be respawnable, or not - it may
be a competition to get the most pawns off the board.

You may be able to move all your pawns wach turn, or only move one per
turn. Allied pawns may or may not be able to share squares. But enemy
pawns may not, in fact they can block each other's motion. The
exception is when the moving pawn is riding a cube that has chosen to
go in that direction (in this case, the blocking pawn is squished and
destroyed.)

That's the game.

Of course, you can hop in a cube and change it every turn in an
attempt to steer it. But getting off the board like that could take a
while, and if it bumps another cube, you are a goner.

If you change the first numbers, you can almost control which way the
cube is going. By setting the second, you can literally keep the cube
from choosing certain directions.

Please feedback this idea. I want to know whether or not I should code
the game.
