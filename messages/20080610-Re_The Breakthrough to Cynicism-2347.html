So you're good at searching, and you knew where to look. Well, I found
out too, eventually, but the BGG forums are evidence that most people
aren't that good at searching. There are some abstract fans in my
local game store, I asked them about 10x10 draughts, they said that
they had tried to find them but failed. So yes, it is an issue.

It isn't just the boards. Strategy books are also almost completely
unavailable in English (or any non Russian/Dutch/French language). I
suppose you could use Google translate on the French federation's
pages like I do, but considering that GT translates "jeu de dames" as
"Mühlenspiel" - you get the idea, it takes a good deal of decryption
when the translator has practically nothing of the technical
vocabulary.

Improvised boards are not good enough. They might be good enough for
me, but I'm just one person, and one person can't play a game on his
own. I need to convince people to try, and for that, the visual appeal
of a "real" board is essential. Few people enjoy games purely for
their abstract qualities. Not even I can say that I do that. Hex on a
square grid, for example? It works, but it's just not the same. Solid
bits = serious game.

But thanks for the game shop link. now I can compare prices, and see
how nice a set I can get while remaining below the tariff limits!
