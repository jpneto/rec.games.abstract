There was this game that my math teacher used to play with us in junior high
school. Actually she didn't really play it with us because we didn't know
how to. Apparently the whole point of the game was to figure out what the
rules were.

I think it was called Petals Around the Rose, and it involved two dice. The 
only clue she ever gave us was "The name of the game is the key to the game,
and the key to the game is the name of the game." If you know what I'm talking
about, please let me know (email is fine) because it's been bugging the hell
out of me since 8th grade.

Thanks!

- Michelle.
