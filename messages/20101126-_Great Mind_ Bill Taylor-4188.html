Seriously Nick, if Bill Taylor is "one of the greatest minds in abstract
games", how do you account for this shit?

I'm not trying to put you on the spot, Nick.  I know you made a comment in
private not knowing that brainless shit, Corey Clark, would run and post it
on a public forum.  But I think you speak for many.  Korneliussen, that fat
idiot Fat Phil the Dreamweaver, etc.

But some of us are having trouble appreciating Bill Taylor's greatness. 
Help us out.  Give us a hint.  Bill Taylor designed Projex rofl, his big
claim to fame.  So what?  It's a geometric curiosity that's virtually
unplayable.  Dime a dozen.

Taylor's been "around for a while".  So what?  He hasn't been around as long
as Christian Freeling.  Taylor was "in the trenches".  In the trenches doing
what?  Fiddling, diddling, and coming up empty handed for fifty years?

Maybe Taylor really does have a great mind.  He gets tired of being fawned
over all the time in math circles so he comes to rec.games.abstract and
pretends to be totally stupid.
