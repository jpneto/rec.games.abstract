You are going to love this SimCity 2000 game. Its got a lot of new
stuff that the old one didn't have and its got enough complexity to
keep you busy for days.

To start with you are able to terriform your own landscape (the game
is played in an isometric view instead of from directly above). Once
you have your landscape you don't just plunk down 3x3 grids of zones
(residential, commercial and industrial) but instead you use a point
and sweep that allows you to create rectangles as large as you want.
Zones can now be set as dense or light.

Aside from the roads and electricity that you had to hook up in the
old SimCity, in this one you are also allowed to build watermains,
subways (with special terminals to connect with above-ground
railways), bus depots, highways (with on/off ramps and cloverleaves),
tunnels, water towers, water pumps, de-salination plants, water
treatment plants, etc.

You may also build hospitals, prisons, schools, universites,
libraries, zoos, marinas, and arenas. As mayor you can pass laws on
stuff like literacy and anti-drug programs or city beautification
plans. You may also issue $10000 bonds in order to raise money.

Report are given in the form of a newspaper that comes up on the
screen twice a year. It's not as informative as the report that the
old one use to give you but there are other places to find that
information (eg. population growth, net worth etc.)

Police stations and fires stations work a bit different. If a fire (or
riot) occurs you can press an Emergency button. This allows you to
assign forces to positions around the areas affected. This way you can
use strategy to fight fires (eg. put firemen between the fire and the
Ballpark). Once you grow to a certain size the government will issue
you a military base. You can use military troops to perform the same
fuctions as the police or firemen.

Electric power can come from coal, oil, hydro (which has to be build
on waterfalls), fission, wind, solar, microwave (energy beamed down
from satellites), or fusion. I'm currently trying to build an
"Enviro-city" that keeps pollution to a minimal... Oh ya, you are able
to tax certain industries (eg. paper mill) at a higher rate then
others to encourage or discourage different industries.

Go out and buy it! (Or borrow it from a friend... there's no copy
protection)
