3. Precis of group proposal.

PURPOSE

  The newsgroup "rec.games.miniatures" would be a forum for discussing
  the all aspects of the hobby of tabletop miniature wargaming of all
  periods, from figure painting, terrain construction, historical information
  and army and unit composition through to rulesets, tabletop tactics,
  scenarios, campaigning and competitions.

  A "rec.games.miniatures" newsgroup would provide its readers an opportunity
  to discuss their experiences with other hobbyists, sharing skills, ideas,
  information and techniques on topics discussed.

  One major aim of the group is to provide a focus for hobbyists on the net
  to gain assistance from others in finding solutions to specific
  problems, e.g. locating information and sources for a topic or range
  of figures, rules or terrain materials or providing information on a
  new period a player wishes to try out.
