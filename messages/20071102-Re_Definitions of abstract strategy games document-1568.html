That's a good point.  These "key elements" that purportedly "define

Abstract strategy games, are a subset of boardgames, so when you
attempt to define and list what is involved with them, you end up also
producing a taxonomy chart for all abstract strategy games.  By doing
this, you then can reduce what is or is not relevant to whether a game
is abstract or not.  This observation you made is a side-effect.

I would think if you want to do an academically thorough job on it you
should start with saying these are the key elements of a board game, and
further develop them to formally differentiate how the board, pieces

This discussion highlights a problem that's been ongoing since the
outset of these discussions on the IAGO forums.  (By the way Rich,
rec.games.abstract is a much better place to discuss these issues than
the IAGO forums.)  The stated goal was to objectively describe what an
abstract game is.  Absolutely no progress was ever made toward that
end and still hasn't been, even here.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is to come up with working parameters to handle an identity aspect
for IAGO.  I posted it here to generate discussion, and if the bulk of
what is discussed is here, that is fine.  What I would say, in
reference to tweaking the document for IAGO that appears on the web,
that should be contained to IAGO. I am concerned about letting the
world at large get ahold of any official document that is up and pull
an "elephant population is doubling in Africa" Colbertish modification
to any document that is up.

A lot of subjective qualifiers
were suggested along the way such as "I know an abstract game when I
see it," and how long it would take a "typical" TV audience to
understand the game.  The few attempts at objective qualifiers were
immediately shot down.  Even the suggestion of excluding games with
random elements was quickly ruled out in favor of the absurd notion
that abstract games should include either random elements or hidden
information but not both.  (This is when the image of the hapless
astronaut with the severed tether began to formulate.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The have either but not both is to put a boundary on to the amount of
randomness and bound what IAGO covers to go as far as including
backgammon and Kriegspiel, which do fall in the boundaries of what is
acceptable.  I also add another criterion that the outcome of an
action a player takes should be 100% deterministic in nature when they
take it.  That means that the results of a player's action, when they
take it, is 100% certain.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think the root problem is that it's impossible to objectively define
an abstract game.  You can certainly start with "no random elements"
and "no hidden information" (which would exclude simultaneous move
games.)  This would narrow the field considerably.  The problem is the
definition of "lightly themed".  That's subject to interpretation.
One gamer's lightly themed game is another gamer's heavily themed
game.  There's more gray area than black and white.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

And the problem is that you rule out games that most people would
consider abstract strategy games, such as backgammon and kriegspiel,
which is a problem.  The issue you raised with theme is why I
discounted it.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The listing of accepted categories was probably the most realistic
attempt to define abstract games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The categories are the most practical.  The rest is a framework for
looking at abstracts (and an extension all boardgames) philosophically
and more of providing a theoretical basis for games, and an
environment that helps people think on issues as design and other
aspects.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
You have territory games and
capturing games, etc.  But it's still really hazy even with this.  For
example, maybe Chess could be considered a "war game", an excluded
category, depending on how you define war game.  Or conversely a war
game might be considered a "territory game", an included category.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There could be a "war game" of a sort if the combat results were
deterministic.  This is why theme is excluded.  The game "Battle: A
Game of Generals" would be considered part of this.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Another problem is all these separate lists.  There's this circular,
denial based argument of "Oh, this list isn't really for blah, blah,
blah.  It's only for blah, blah, blah."  Any attempt to explain the
true purpose of any of these lists is perpetually procrastinated.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The reason for the list is first to have a way to classify tournament
structure and provide classes of games that are close enough so
players would feel comfortable enough playing games that are similar.
It is a main way to be able to promote a wide range of abstracts and
have them make sense.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There was the "top 100" list.  Top 100 in what respect?  Are these the
top 100 most representative abstract games?  That's akin to a top 100
list of most representative plants.  Either it's a plant or it isn't.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Once you get what is define as acceptable to IAGO, then you are able
to poll the players to see which abstracts in different categories
they like the most and enjoy the most, so you then can come up with a
top (most popular) set of games.  You then can base a tournament
around these games.   The criterion could also be used to be
determined by some committee of players picked.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
One plant isn't more representative of plants than another plant.  You
have to either include all abstract games or admit that it's only a
random selection of abstract games.  Or possibly a selection of the
most well known games, or the most well thought of games.  There has
to be some criteria other than the utterly arbitrary "top 100" with no
mention of a prioritization scheme.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This was meant for discussion here.  One of the meanings is games of
most interest or best in design (if a committee decides).  You go
something like the "Games 100" list, but for abstract strategy games.
You do a tiny subset to determine game of the year, for example, for
new designs.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I appreciate the effort here.  As a designer of abstract games, it's
interesting to see general discussions of abstract games.  But these
attempts to objectively define abstract games have only been sheer
folly from the outset.  It's fundamentally flawed, pseudo science
with, for example, a claim to enumerate key elements of abstract games
followed by an extensive list of key elements of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, with
nothing to distinguish abstract games.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I am seriously going to disagree with you.  I believe you can come up
with a sufficiently working list that it can help an association to
promote abstracts to run properly.  If you don't allow for this, then
you are doomed to have modern abstracts perpetually fail and become
nothing more than footnotes in books that hopefully don't get burned
in the future.  Also, people are free to come up with their own
classification system, and definitions.  However, I would consider it
a bit on the silly side to say it is futile.  I mean, after all, who
is qualified to classify books so you can build a library and be able
to have them in the right spot.  Who is this Dewey guy anyway, and how
dare he try to impose a decimal system for library books?

One thing that will look to come out of all this and the association
is a master list of abstract strategy games from all over the web,
which will act as a resource.

There is serious practical applications to, as is noted by the people
involved with the chessvariants.org website, and the attempt to
standardize fantasy chess pieces.  And there is the case of the
Mancala family of games, which have large numbers of variants on their
games, and no standards organization.

Anyhow, there will eventually come out as the definition by IAGO of
what quantifies as an abstract strategy game.  It will then be an IAGO
standard abstract strategy game.  People are free to come up with
their own and call it a Ralph standard abstract strategy game if they
like.  At least it would be progress from what is now.  And the IAGO
standard is likely to get modified and changed over time.
