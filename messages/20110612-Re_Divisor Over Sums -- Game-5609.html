In the above and in snipped lines, you refer to a number of
computed values as "variables".  The term "values" would be better.

That score function seems (at least in your example game below) 
to lead to somewhat mediocre play experience.  Perhaps something
like "sum of numbers divisible by d, minus the largest number
divisible by d, with d=1 disallowed" would make the game more 
interesting.

For example, let us say two poorly-playing players have this n=4 grid:

08 09 01 10
03 11 16 07
02 14 15 05
04 12 06 13

H = (17,10,11, 14,27,23, 16,29,20, 16,18,19)

Let us say that player 1 picks 4, then he gets 4*3 = 12 points. (Because
h's = 16, 20, and 16 are divisible by 4.) Had he picked 29, he could
have gotten 29, however.

V = (11,5,6, 20,25,26, 17,31,21, 17,12,18)

Player 2 picks 3 and gets 3*4 = 12 points. She should have picked 31.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Presumably to allow the H player to feel less bad in defeat?
31 is enough to win, but 17 would score 3 points more.  

With the alternate score function I mentioned above (sum of divisibles,
less largest divisible) scores like the following would result:
1: 178    2: 56    3: 36    4: 12    5: 25
6: 18     7-16: 0  17: 17   &gt;17: 0
which suggests that this function would tend to favor divisors like
2 or 3 (if 1 is disallowed), which apparently would give rather boring 
play.  Probably there is no easy way to make this game playable in its
original form; to be "interesting", a score functions probably should 
give fairly uniform results across a wide range of divisors, which 
then leads to a lot of tedium when comparing choices of divisors.

In the above, much of the game time would consist of figuring out 
what divisor to choose, after all the numbers have been recorded in
the grid.  However, if the players record their divisors in advance, 
there would be more emphasis on number placement strategy, and 
presumably more-interesting game play.  The recorded divisors could
be concealed until end, or, optionally, revealed at game beginning.

A simple variant that might be easy and interesting:  After H and V 
players take turns placing 1, 2, ... n^2 into an n x n grid, the score
of each is the largest horizontal-pair sum or vertical-pair sum, 
respectively, that he or she finds, and the larger score wins.  This
should give a playable game.  Does a winning strategy exist?
