I've always thought of strategy to be what you do without making reference
to individual units/pieces in a game. Take chess for example: I could say I
have a defensive strategy, or an offensive strategy, or a strategy to
control the center of the board, etc. But as soon as I talk about individual
pieces, like what I like to do with my queenside rook, then it's tactics.

The same holds true for wargames. In Bitter Woods (about the Battle of the
Bulge), I can talk about what rivers I want to hold, what towns I'll give up
without a fight, or where I'd like my front lines to be by turn 4. That's
all strategy. When I start to say that such-and-such a corps needs to be to
hex 2014 by turn 3, then that's tactics.

Take go: my strategy would be how loosely I arrange my pieces at first, or
whether I immediately attack an opponent's corner, or something like that.
Tactics would be how I position individual pieces (making reference to the
intersections, for example).

It's all a question of granularity. I think the scope of the game counts for
a lot. What might be strategic in Bitter Woods is too granular for even a
discussion of tactics in Axis and Allies. So the game's scope is a big
determinant of what will be classed as strategy and what tactics.

Hope this helps!

That's a good general definition but it is still not precise.

I'm not convinced that a precise definition is possible.
Consider one difference in how Kasparov and Deep Thought/Deep Blue
play chess.  In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov
by sacrificing a piece.  Computer programs are not supposed to be
able to make sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-mordem
analysis, Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed all
possible variations at least up to the point where the computer
regained the sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice
the piece for strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones.  A
human player would not be capable of examining all the variations
up to the point where they regained the sacrificed piece.  A human
player would make the sacrifice because they concluded that the
strategic advantages outweighed the temporary material deficit.
In summation, a human player would make the sacrifice for strategic
reasons while the computer would make it for tactical reasons, thus
blurring the line between strategy and tactics.
