It's a fact of life: everyone uses cheat codes. In chess, you can't
really cheat because the rule set is too clear and there's no
information hiding.

Actually, if you've ever played chess online ... there ARE cheaters.
They simply run some chess software in the background that tells them
what to play.

The solution is that, if you "lose" to a cheater, you have simply
wasted your time. Take whatever enjoyment you had and leave. It's not
like you need to feel shame because you lost.

The other thing that comes to mind is that, in the games of nomic that
i have played (online) there was no turn sequence.
