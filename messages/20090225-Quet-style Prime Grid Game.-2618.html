Some time ago I invented a mathematical dart/board game which
required both manual dexterity and (a little) mathematical skill.
It was a useful game to practise a bit of factor-&amp;-prime work
for my kids at school.

The way it went was, each player had 5 turns of 3 darts,
and the total of the 3 darts was summed, BUT only the greatest
prime divisor was kept and scored.  The total of the 5 such scores
determined one's overall score and the winner.  The full dartboard
numerics were used, with doubles, trebles and bulls-eye's.

It was a great game, because one could still come back from
a long way behind with a lucky treble, say, maybe 57 or 60,
provided one could increase it to a prime number with one or
two more darts.  One could, of course, simply throw away
one's last dart or two if one already had a good score.
So it was a good idea, early in the game, to aim for the 20
sector, which has 19 and 17 alongside, so that if one were
a merely passable dart player one could hit one of those and
keep it, being prime.  Rather than risk going on and destroying
it down to a 3 or even 2 !     It was a cool and fun game.
........

However, the main point of this post is to mention a possible
transfer of the idea to a pure abstract game.  My previous
attempts at this, tested with my regular opponent, proved
rather failures, though playable.   But, thinking about it
again, an idea occurred to me based on Leroy Quet's many
grid games, (often involving primes and factors), so I publish
it here for trial.  Knowing Leroy, he has probably already
invented it, unknown to me; and I have also probably mentioned
the basic idea here before.  If so I apologise for my memory!
_________________

The Basic Game
==============
Played on a 5x5 grid, the players alternately fill any grid cell
with a number from the set {1,2,3,...,29,30}.  The numbers
are on their own discs, so each one can only be used once.
(The 5 left-over numbers are discarded unscored.)

Scoring:  Each row and column is added up, and the score for that
"""""""   row/column is the highest prime factor of the total.

A scores the rows, and B the columns.  Best total of 5 wins.

Example:
=======

30 29  4  3  1 :  67 --&gt; 67
28 27 26 14  5 : 100 --&gt;  5
17 18 10 24  6 :  75 --&gt;  5
11  9 23 19  2 :  64 --&gt;  2
13  7 15 16 20 :  71 --&gt; 71  ....total 150 to A.
................
99 90 78 76 34

vv vv vv vv vv

11  5 13 19 17   ....total 65 to B.     A wins by tons!!

Variations
==========
Many variations suggest themselves without changing the essential
nature of the game.

1: A board of size 4x4 or 3x3 could easily (and more quickly) be
   used.  It need not even be square, if handicaps in favour of
   weaker players are to be used!  Weaker gets the shorter lines.

2: The pool of usable numbers might go to a higher or lower number
   than 30; or contain repeats.

3: If it turns out that there is a strong advantage to the first
   chooser-and-placer, or maybe to the last, or for quicker
   games (e.g. by email), a 1,2,2,2,... multi-move option
   might be used.  Or  2,2,2,...2,2,1.

4: If there are more discs to use than 25, (as in the basic game),
   then players might have some options to "kill" discs along
   with playing their moves.

5: It could be a solitaire game, (a puzzle), to get the best
   possible grand total score, (2N summands), on an NxN grid
   with tokens numbered merely 1 up to N^2.

In any event, the basic game, perhaps with 4x4 or 3x3 board,
seems quite a good one to me, involving as it does the same
tokens being scored by both players simultaneously - always
a favourite theme of mine in abstract games!
