: Now what I want to know, is "What's the name of this game?"
: I'm certain I read about it somewhere (I don't think up games this
: good myself, normally). Where did I read about this game, if anywhere?

: If you think of the points as "energy" the game is a lot like a tug of war,

That's what I've heard it called...

: I'm in the process of writing a program to play a cut-down version of
: the game (5 cells and fewer points). I wrote a version of the full
: game once before, but I was able to beat it easily. Now with the
: cut down version, I can explicitly work out the game-theoretic "optimal"
: strategy, but I also want to have the program try sometimes to exploit patterns
: in the opponent's moves (people do tend to be fairly patterned in their
: moves), but not in a predictable fashion itself (i.e. it will only deviate
: from the optimal strategy in a non-obvious way - and will fall back on
: the unbeatable strategy if it comes off badly). But before I really get
: stuck into it fully, I want to call it something.

We've been comtemplating adding it to Richard's PBeM Server...
It is in progress.

: (Oh, the sweetness of guessing one point higher than your opponent!
:  The bitter Pyrrhic victory of spending 12 points to your opponent's 1!)
