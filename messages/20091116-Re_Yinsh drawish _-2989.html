I think Yinsh is drawish. Agree ?

Have a look at this boardhttp://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/Yinsh/Yinsh.php?539
nearly half full and the scores is 0-0

What kind of definition of drawish is that? Surely, to be drawish, it
has to end in a draw, and not just go on for many moves without
removals. I don't have stats for pbmserv, but on boardspace, there is
not a single draw recorded so far. I suppose it's technically possible
to draw in Yinsh, but if you can show me a competitive Yinsh game that
ended in draw, well, I'd like to see it.

Remember, removals isn't actually "the score" in Yinsh. It's not like
goals in football, because only the third removal matters. There's
still plenty of action in the game you linked to.
