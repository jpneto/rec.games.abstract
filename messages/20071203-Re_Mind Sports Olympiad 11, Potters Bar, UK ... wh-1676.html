It's been three months since the Mind Sports Olympiad for 2007.
Nowhere on their website are any results from any of the scheduled
tournaments.

I would greatly appreciate info from anyone who attended. Were there
in fact any tournaments held at all? Was everyone abducted by aliens?
Is this one of those reality warps that Philip K. Dick wrote about?
Did whatsisface abscond with the money?

Hi David

1) I understand that there should be some more info re results on the MSO 
website shortly.
2) Tournaments generally ran as scheduled
3) Some games organisations have got the results of events relating to those 
particular games held at MSO up (Pacru/Shacru/Azacru results are on the 
competitions page on the Pacru website plus reports on Boardgamegeek)
4) I'm pretty sure that David M Pearce won the "Pentamind" followed by Alain 
Dekker
5) Instances of alien abduction may have been exaggerated
6) Whatsisface did abscond with the money (again!) but you will be glad to 
hear
7) MSO are already planning a Central London Event for August 2008
8) Venue and future were discussed at the meeting with participants keen to 
see a return to a more central venue.  The continuing issues (in the view of 
many) are enough funding and organisation to get a good venue and market it 
the event successfully.   The event currently relies on a good deal of 
voluntary labour and good will.
