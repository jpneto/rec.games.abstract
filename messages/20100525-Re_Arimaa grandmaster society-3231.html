Well, lying Thomas, effectively you really did lie.  You were quoting
the zero statistic in support of your claim that Arimaa is ultra-
resistant to draws.  In fact, the real reason for the zero statistic
is programmatic superko enforcement, something you were fully aware of
but "neglected" to mention.

Yeah, maybe your statements, taken individually, were factually
correct.  But you tried to perpetrate a hoax here at
rec.games.abstract, lying Thomas - something that will not be
forgotten.

If, however, any superko like rule ruins games for you,

Chess and Go are good enough, but Arimaa isn't.  There's no excuse for
a modern game incorporating superko.  Standards, people.  Standards.
