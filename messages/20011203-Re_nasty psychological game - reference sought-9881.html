Who has any information on this game, or can point me to literature or a
website?

11 straight lines are drawn between player 1 and player two.
Both players place a bet in a box placed at the 6th (middle) line.
Both players get a score of 50 points.
At every move, they both write down how many points they want to "invest" in
the next move.
Then they show their papers to each other. The box will move one line
towards player 1 if he has the highest bid, to player 2 when he has, or
stays on the line where it is when player 1 and 2 invest the same.
Points are substracted from the 50 points both players initially have.

As an example: after move 1 player 1 has invested 5 points, player 2 has
invested 3.
The box is moved one line towards player 1. Now player one has 45 points to
player two 47.

When you can move the box to your home line, you win all the money.
Otherwise, at the end of the game (both players have invested all their
points) the money goes to the player nearest to the box.

I've played this game a few times during my student years. It was quite a
nasty game, because psychology seemed to have an enormous role. Sometimes I
played guys with 40 or even 30 points against their 50, and still managed to
win.

Does anybody know this game ?

No but it reminds me of an old card game called Goofspeil(sp?).
Each of two players gets all the cards of one suit.  The cards
of a third suit are shuffled and placed face down in a pile
between the players.  The fourth suit is not used.  Aces are
worth 1 point, twos are worth 2 points, threes are worth 3 points,
and so on up to kings which are worth 13 points.

A play consists of turning up the top card of the central pile.
Each players selects a "betting" card and places it face down.
After both players have bet a card, they turn the betting cards
over and the higher card wins the central card (in the case of
a tie, nobody wins the central card -- it is simply removed from
further play).  The player who ends up winning the most total
points is the winner.

If the first card turned up is an ace, then there is not much point
in betting a lot for it.  But if the first card turned up is high,
say a king, then there is a real question of how much you should
bet for it.  You could bet an ace and if your opponent bets a king,
then you can be real happy because the future increase in betting
strength more than offsets the points lost (theoretically, you
could then win every remaining card by always betting exactly
one more point than your opponent).  I recall a game where the
first card was indeed a king and my opponent bet a three reasoning
that if I bet an ace or a two in an attempt at making the
previously mentioned play, then they would cheaply win 13 points
and that if I played high (e.g. a king) then the gain in betting
strength would more than make up for the lost points.  However
I crossed them up by betting a 5 which cheaply won the 13 points! :-)
Of course I wouldn't have been so happy if they had bet a 6 or 7
but that's the way this game goes.  Pyschology plays a huge part.
Of course you have to keep track of how many points each of you
has won and what betting cards you each have left.  There are 91
total points available so winning 46 points guarantees a win.
