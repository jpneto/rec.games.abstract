Major Monkey Tweak: Monkey babies now move like Chess queens and the board
has been changed from 6x6 to 8x8.  So both queens and babies move (somewhat)
like Chess queens now.

In the two games I played against Gert (Schactelhalm), I won by checkmate
the first time and he won by checkmate the second.

Gert game 1:

Gert game 2:
 <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=162522&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en">http://gc1.iggamecenter.com/gm.php?gid=10000&amp;sid=162522&amp;place=0&amp;lang=en</a>

Four people suggested variations of Monkey Queen in the days following its
release.  Of course I took this as flattery, but I think there was also a
message there:

"Clever idea, Mark, but needs improvement."

In fact, Gert literally said it needs improvement.  I didn't like any of the
suggested variations, as I said earlier, because they all made the rule set
more complicated.  This new version of MQ though delivers more punch without
a more complicated rule set. It's different, with the babies now moving like
Chess queens instead of Chess kings, but no more complicated.

The only cause for concern would be first move advantage, but I haven't seen
any sign of that.  If any particular first moves turn out to be unduly
advantageous, the pie rule should clear that up.

I'll try to pound the new rule sheet together as quick as I can.  Might take
a couple days though.

Moves 25 and 26 in game one look strange to me.  Did the monkey queen
actually jump from d1 to a2?  Or did a few moves somehow get
compressed on the iggc recorder and end up looking strange?

Any thoughts yet on strategic principles?
