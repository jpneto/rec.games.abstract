I read with interest your article on the rules of hex, I have never 
played the games (never having found anyone to play against) but have 
messed around with small boards on paper.

I would very much like to know if anyone has written a hex game for 
computer play, or even better if someone would provide source code or an 
algorithm as I would very much to write a travelling hex program for my 
handheld pocket computer (which unfortunately is not IBM compatible).

There is a very simple way to equalize the advantage to the first player. 
First for any size board we can (in theory) divide up the board in to 
those  hexes which are a winning move for the first player (on his first 
move) and those which are losing positions (the center hex(es) are almost 
certainly winning positions). By striking out one of these hexes the game 
becomes a draw. To see this we argue as follows.

For white playing first. He should play as if he had an extra peice on 
the forbidden hex, since an extra peice can never be a disadvantage he 
cannot be forced to lose, however we can no longer be sure that he has a 
strategy to win since his winning line may be dependant on the forbidden 
hex.

For black playing second. He plays as if he were the first player having 
made his first move on the forbidden square (which was by definition a 
winning move) and hence cannot be forced to lose.

Thus as neither player can be forced to lose the game is a draw, although 
it is non trivial and I suspect from the 'proof' given requires exactly 
the same strategy to draw as hex requires to win !

So to Vex. We add an additional neutral peice say red which is given to 
the second player who has the option to place this peice on the board on 
any empty hex of his choice either before the first player makes his 
initial move or on any subsequent turn in addition to playing his black 
peice.

Vex is a draw because white can always pretend the neutral peice is an 
extra white peice (which therefore cannot disadvantage him forcing him to 
lose) and black may place the neutral peice before the start of the game 
and then by assuming the peice to be black and playing the 'hex' winning 
strategy cannot be forced to lose either.

By using a nuetral peice and giving the second player the option when to 
play it we no longer need to 'know' which hexes are winning hexes for the 
first player in order to make the game fair.
