Do you refer to

BTW, the "new" starting position is different from what your pic shows!!!

And what has happened since then?

I did some over-the-board Abalone tournaments (MSO and Italian MSO) and the
initial setup was the one showed in the link you gave. I believe there is
some first player's advantage, but the game is playable.

But I partecipated to French Abalone Championship in Cannes, and the setup
was the original! And the majority of French players wants to keep the
tradition! Unbelievable... When I play a game, I usually search the best
move... what about a game in which the best move is a drawing one? And what
about a game in which you are prevented to do the best move by a referee who
says "your move is too passive!"... How can I play a game in which I must
always consider whether my moves are aggressive enough according to the
judgement of a referee?
(Well, I hope to have been clear enough; English is not my original
language, so accept my apologies)
