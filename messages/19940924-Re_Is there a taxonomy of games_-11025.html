I recall seeing somebody in this newsgroup mention that there are "five basic

Would most other gamers agree?

In World Game Review #3, Mike Keller gives the following revised taxonomy 
of games:

Race Games
Positional Games
Chess Games
Capturing Games
	The Checkers Family
Melding Games
Tricktaking Games
Discarding Games
Other Card and Tile Games
Mancala Games 
	Classic
	Modern
Number Games
	Nim
	Pure Gambling games
Dice Games
Financial Games
War Games
Roleplaying Games
Sports Games
Other Simulations
Games of Dexterity
Puzzles
Logic Games
Word Games

and the ever popular

Miscellaneous games.

The taxonomy of ideas is always difficult. Where does one place "Racing 
Kings", for instance? This is a Race game played with chess pieces, using 
many of the standard rules of chess. The trading-card games are more like 
war games than like card games, but just ask about them on 
rec.games.board some time. 

The limitations of taxonomy of ideas transcend any one specific taxonomy. 
No matter what lines you draw, similar games are going to be grouped 
apart and dissimilar games will be grouped together. A taxonomy by 
designer will group "Mousetrap" with "Acquire" and "Can't Stop", or "Web 
and Starship" with "Toon". A taxonomy by pure-strategy vs. elements of 
luck will group "Acquire" with "Snakes and Ladders" or "Chess" with 
"Tic-Tac-Toe". 

For more insight into Keller's taxonomy (which comes as close to 
satisfying as any I have seen), order WGR #1 and #3 from:
