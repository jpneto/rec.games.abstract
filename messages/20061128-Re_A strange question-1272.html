<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting David Parlett's message of Yesterday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>But that's OK, because I realize that I have another bad habit besides
<br>failing to think things through:&nbsp; I rely too much on reading.&nbsp; I'm
<br>reluctant to try anything new unless I've first read an instruction
<br>book on it.&nbsp; I don't trust myself to learn via hands-on experience, so
<br>I always look for books first.&nbsp; And sometimes I never get past the
<br>book-reading stage.
<br></blockquote></blockquote>
<br>I feel that way with things like chess and go, where I know I'll get 
thrashed by most players if I don't have at least some preparation.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>That's interesting, albeit tangential. I'm exactly the same. Furthermore, I 
like to take my instructions neat - i.e. in generalities, and relatively free 
from&nbsp; confusing real-life examples except where absolutely necessary to 
clarify a point. Are we, as I suspect, in a minority? Does this provide any 
useful pointers towards the writing of rules?
<br></blockquote>
<br>On the other hand, I absolutely need practice and examples.&nbsp; If the 
instructions are vague and/or sparse enough for me to remember them 
properly, then I tend not to be able to connect the principles to 
practice.
