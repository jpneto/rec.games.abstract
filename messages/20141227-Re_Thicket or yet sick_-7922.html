Playtest the game seriously. Just try to play ONE game but entirely (to the end) and you will see how many flaws. Change yourself the rules as you play to see if the game could be fixed.

I encourage everyone else to do so, but I'm not on the inventor's trail anymore. Io happened accidentally and I didn't playtest it because I've got other things on the brain.

Why I have seen in Luis an excellent game designer in the future because he gives lot of care to study the details of any mechanism. He quickly see the core of the game.
He is a good "fixator" of games (balancing, scoring and so on).
He is little bit technical guy.

No argument there.

I like Mark Steere because he is confident on his ideas. He will fight for his games and I like that.
That`s good sign.

No argument there either. I prefer his 'Flume' over DaB anytime. He's actually a nice guy with a compulsory  inclination to hide it.
