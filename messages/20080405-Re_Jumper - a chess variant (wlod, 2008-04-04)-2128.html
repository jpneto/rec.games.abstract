For your amusement and entertainment
I made up the gollowing chess variant:

Replace queen by jumper - it captures
exactly like queen but its noncapturing
moves are different: you may jump
vertically or horizontally or diagonally
to any unoccupied square of the same
color as the jumper's present square color.

Thus jumper can change the square color
only by capturing a piece of the opponent.

Observe that jumper attacks and defends
pieces, and participates in the mating
configurations exactly like queen,

Enjoy,

Do you have a way to check that piece to make sure that piece works in
chess?

Perhaps someone can come up with a Power Mutant version, where you
have a piece called the "Mutant" and then you have a list of powers.
You randomly select what both player's mutant piece will have, and
then you play the game.  Your jumper piece could be one of those.
That piece does look overpowered though.
