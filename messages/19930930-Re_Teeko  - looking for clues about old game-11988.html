It doesn't say here, but I presume you mean:- each player plays only his

Yes.  (I was trying to keep the description brief.)

I'm afraid I didn't follow any of this section !  Doubtless my own fault,
but could you please describe this a bit more clearly ?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Basically, in the "standard opening" you simply place your tokens one at a
time, as you might expect.  In the other 15 variants, you sometimes get to
choose your <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opponent's<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> play instead of your own.  (The standard opening
corresponds to the empty set.)

You didn't say anything about what "pointing" to a cell could mean, or what
the opponent playing one of your tokens could be.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Pointing to a cell is the proper etiquette for indicating where your opponent
is required to play.  From a game-theoretic viewpoint, it would be equivalent
to simply picking up one of your opponent's tokens and placing it on the
board; but if you do it that way you're likely to get confused about whose
turn it is.  (Because it's the token-color that alternates for the first 8
moves, <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the identity of the player making the decision.)

Is it some kind of method for equalizing the chances and nullifying the
initial move advantage ?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Perhaps, to some extent.  But I think it's just a fun variant.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
If so, you may recall the rather simpler-seeming mechanism I posted a few
months ago, which can apply to virtually any board game, with excellent
effectiveness, I think.    I called it "three-move equalization".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Was that the idea of having one player start the game and then have the other
player choose which side to play?  My own favorite "equalization" technique is
to have the first player make one move and thereafter each player gets two
moves.  This doesn't apply to all board games, but it seems to work well with
Hex, simplified Go-Moku, and even Chess (with appropriate check-restrictions).
