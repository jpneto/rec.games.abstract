<div class="moz-text-flowed">I must admit that I don't know exactly the differences between sowing 
games, but since nobody else bites on this post: Awari was recently 
solved, by a team, you can see more details at 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~awari/">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~awari/</a>. The people there should know more 
about how to solve other sowing games too though.

<br>
<br>I am hoping someone more versed in the mysteries of game theory might help
<br>me out on an issue. For a given position in a given game, are there any
<br>smooth ways to calculate which possible lines of play might have led to that
<br>position?
<br>
<br>Specifically, I need to do this to an early endgame position in awale (to
<br>include in a piece of fiction). I have tried exploring the variation root by
<br>hand, but given the nature of the game, it grows immensely big after a very
<br>short time. So I am at a loss. Is there any software that does this kind of
<br>thing, or articles conserning it?
<br>
<br>While I'm at it: Is there a standard way of recording a game of awale?
<br>Thanks for any help consering all (or some) of this.
