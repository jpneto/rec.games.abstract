Eleusis is not a pure strategy game.  (If these interlopers keep
invading the newsgroup, then perhaps it's time to completely redo
rec.games.* :-)

Yes, but it IS a highly abstract game and was specifically considered
when the creation of this group was discussed.  Actually, this group has
set a record in my mind for "highest signal-to-noise ratio after only
three days in existence", so I don't think anything really needs to be
done, except for discouraging the people who wanted to play Nomic here
instead of via email.

The rules for Eleusis can be found in
        New Rules for Classic Games / R. Wayne Schmittberger, 1992

Here, it says Eleusis was invented in 1956 and revised between 1973
and 1976, so the version in the 1977 Mathematical Games column should
be current.

The current set of rules (much improved, IMHO) is to be found in one of
the new Martin Gardner books published in the late 80's.  (I think it's
"Wheels, Life, and other Mathematical Amusements", but I don't remember
exactly and none of the libraries around here have it.)

<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>New Rules<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> describes many games, game variants, new uses for your
moldering game equipment, techniques for modifying and repairing the
rules of games, etc.  A very interesting book.

This was VERY interesting, and has just been added to the list of game
books that I must at least have a prolonged look at, if not buy.  Could
someone post a similar list for Sid Sackson's "A Gamut of Games"?
