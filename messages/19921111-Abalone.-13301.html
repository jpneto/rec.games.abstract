Anyone here ever played Abalone? 

To those who haven't, I'll try to describe it.  The game is played on a
hexagonal board 9 hexes wide at its widest point.  Two players each have
14 marbles of a color (usually black for one side, white the other).
Here is the usual starting positions(@ = empty board space; o = white
marble; c = black marble):

    c c c c c
   c c c c c c
  @ @ c c c @ @
 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
  @ @ o o o @ @
   o o o o o o
    o o o o o

  Players alternate <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>pushing<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> one, two, or three of their own marbles in a
row.  (After a push, the marble(s) pushed will have shifted one space).  Thus:

                                           KEY TO EXAMPLES:    
          @ @ @ @ @ o o o @             [ @ = empty board position]
becomes                                 [ o = white marble        ]
          @ @ @ @ o o o @ @             [ c = black marble        ] 

If pushing these three marbles to the left.  

It is important to remember that no more than 3 of your own marbles may be
pushed at one time.

When opposing marbles come up against each other, you use your marbles to
push your opponents.  But you must have a greater number of marbles in a
row than your opponent.

	@ @ c c c o o @    Black can push.

	@ @ c o o @        White can push.

	@ c c c o o o @    Neither can push.  This is a block.

	@ c o o c c c @    Black cannot push here.  There must be an empty
			   space to push to.


What happens when you get to the edge of the board?  Here is where the
object of the game comes in.  If you push an opponents marble the is
already at the edge of the board, that marble is now out of play.  The
object is to push six of your opponents marbles off the board.

Just one other thing I should mention.  There is also what is called a
broadside move.  You can move up to three of your own marbles laterally if
all the new positions to be occupied are empty.



 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
@ @ @ @ c c c o c
        ^^^^^

While in the position above the three black marbles could not push to the
right, a lateral move could be made upward.  Resulting in:

 @ @ @ c c c @ @
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ o c

If a northwest lateral move is made.



Well, I hope that is clear enough.  Having said all that, I'd like to know
if there are any experienced Abalone players out there who would like to
play in e-mail.  If there are people who would like to play for the first
time, while it would not be a challenge for me to play a newbie, I would
consider matching new players together if there is any interest in this. 
(Possibly playing your first game through me so there aren't any rules
mistakes when starting out).

If anyone has any questions about how the game is played, please feel free
to ask.

Abalone does exist as a marketed product, and can be bought for about $30
(last time I looked).
