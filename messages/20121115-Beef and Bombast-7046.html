My major beef with Christian Freeling is his endlessly repeated claim that Symple is "perfectly balanced".  But maybe Symple is extraordinarily well balanced at a sufficient board size, and so maybe it's a fine point.  Maybe it can all be chalked up to a language barrier.

Lots of people have complained about my "bombast" so I guess I can try to tone it down a little.  I'll change my stance from "You're full of shit, Christian!" to one of inquiry.

Let's start with this.  Christian, what does it mean for a game to be perfectly balanced?
