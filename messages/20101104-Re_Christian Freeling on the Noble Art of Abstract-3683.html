I've worked with Ed van Zon, Havannah to Symple. I haven't visited a
games club or touched a board since 1986. I didn't need any feedback
apart from Ed's and I surely have no ambition to invent any more
games. I actually declined the offer to consider the Star theme
because I'm working on an essay about the evolution of Draughts. But
Symple happened.

I play, yes, Havannah at LG, to prepare for the 2012 event where I
must score ten out of ten against the strongest bots. Some bots are
very weak, but programming prodigy Timo Ewalds' Castro currently has
an 1800+ rating, and I lost one base-8 game against it (won all the
others base-8 and base-10). Occasionally I play one game or the other
at iGGC.
That's all. I'm rather reclusive and care more about my animals (a
husky, a cat, two raccoon dogs and a burmese python) than about games.
I got a games' mind, especially where it concerns simple homogenuous
organisms, and I feel comfortable using it, but I don't care one bit,
and it certainly isn't worth discussing anything where personal likes
and dislikes among members prevail.

It's a two edged sword, actually. Like finding Symple, which certainly
wouldn't have been the case if the theme hadn't been discussed,
however reluctantly. But find it and it's held against you because you
didn't put in a lot of effort in it and didn't do a lot of playtesting
before publishing it. Because that's what game inventors must do,
according to those who aren't. And don't you dare to be different!

So I can take it or leave it. I have no trouble with Mark shooting in
every direction, including mine. It's a general waste of ammo, but
occasionally he does hit something and he made a couple of games that
cannot be disregarded.
