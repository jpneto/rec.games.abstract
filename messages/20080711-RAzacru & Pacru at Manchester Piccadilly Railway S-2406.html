We're having Shacru &amp; Azacru rapid play competitions  on July 12th and 
Azacru &amp; Pacru competitions on July 19th at Manchester Piccadilly Railway 
Station Balcony Bar (morning and afternoon).  But you're also very welcome 
just to come by and say hello and see what these abstract board games are 
all about.   If you're not in the UK then you just need to get to Manchester 
Airport and Piccadilly is just 15 minutes up the track  ;-)  ... ideal 
international games venue ....
