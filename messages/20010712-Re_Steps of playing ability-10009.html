A problem with this definition is that a set
of several games, in any game where results
are variable (including chess and go, because
even if one player is better than another,
he may sometimes lose), will reduce the effect
of chance and increase the number of levels.

Gerry, if I understand you what you're saying, then I respectfully
disagree.

Yes, the more games you play, the better chance the stronger player will
have to prove his superiority.  This is obvious since we all know a one
game match by itself means almost nothing.  But even if two players
play, for example, a 1,000 game match, a player "one step up" in playing
ability will still only win about 75% of the games.  That's what it
means to be one step up... he's going to win about 75% of the time.  In
fact, the more games played in this match or series, the closer to the
actual 75% percentage we will get.

I've invented a new game called "Quack". It's exactly like chess, except
when you checkmate someone, you reset the board, and replay, until
someone has acheived three checkmates -- first person to do so wins. 

If you have a 75% chance of beating someone at chess, then you have a 90%
chance of beating them at Quack. If you have a 64% chance of beating
someone at chess, then you have a 75% chance of beating them at Quack.

So, for every level in chess, there are about two levels in Quack. Quack
is therefore much more complicated than chess.

You're no fool,  this is the most insightful post I've seen on this
topic.  

The conclusion I reach from your example is that using "steps of
ability" to measure game compexity underestimates the
complexty of games with more of a chance element,  either
because of actual randomness (backgammon) or 
because many games are lost as a result of one bad move
(chess).

Poker can be an extremely complex game,  but of
course on any given hand it's quite likely that
any decent player will almost certainly do the
same thing,  namely fold.
