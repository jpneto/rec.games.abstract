Has anyone out there performed a game-theoretic analysis for the
game Mediocrity? I recall from Metamagical Themas that its conceptual
precursors such as Undercut, Flaunt and Pounce were all amenable to
game theoretic methods that revealed optimal strategies. It is not so
clear to me that Mediocrity is subject to such an analysis, but it may be.
The answer would be of the form: you should play the numbers 1-5 in the
following ratios a:b:c:d:e.

A related question is: can the maximin algorithm be applied to Mediocrity?
Does maximin work for 3 player games? There are very few of these, so I
wonder if it's even been tried. I think it ought to be possible.

Of course, the answers, if any, to both the above questions will depend
on the level of the Mediocrity game being played. Strategy for winning
(that is, coming second :) at level 2 is very different than that for winning
at level 3. And how, if at all, do the various offsets alter strategy?
