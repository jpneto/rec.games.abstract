   I'm trying, just for fun, to make a computer player for an abstract
game similar to Milton Bradley's "Dont Break the Ice"

   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Break_the_Ice">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Break_the_Ice</a>

minus the chance and physical-skill elements. Source code and a 
DOS/Windows executable available here for anyone who wants them:

The game is played on a grid of cells, with each cell initially filled
with an "ice block." Each player, on his turn, "knocks out" one of the
blocks; if this causes any other blocks to be unsupported, they also
fall. The player who causes the last block to fall is the loser.

   Example game:

     123

   a OOO    Alice starts by knocking out B2, the central block.
   b OOO
   c OOO

     OOO    Bob knocks out A3,
     O.O    causing A2 and B3 to fall, as they're no longer
     OOO    supported by an "arch" of connected blocks.

     O..    Alice knocks out C2, causing C3 to fall.
     O..
     OOO

     O..    Bob is forced to knock out one of the blocks
     O..    in the remaining arch, causing all three to
     O..    fall; he loses the game.

   My questions for the rec.games.abstract folks: Has this game been
analyzed before? Is there any known strategy that applies to many
different kinds of boards ("go for the corners first," or something
like that?)

Unlikely, since the win lose condition is determined by the last move.  

It may be that there is some sort of symmetry-based winning solution, 
but in this case the game is degenerate and should be modified to have 
some random blocks removed at the start.

   My question for the comp.programming folks: I quickly determined
that the standard alpha-beta pruning technique doesn't help with
this game, because I don't know any way to evaluate the "strength"
of a position except as a win or loss. So most of the branches in
an alpha-beta tree of any reasonable depth (i.e., not deep enough
to see all possible endings) end up with a value of zero, which means
the computer is moving randomly most of the time.

   Yet there are some positions, such as (I think)

   ....OO
   ....OO
   ....OO
   ....OO
   OOOOOO
   OOOOOO

which a human player can tell are a win for the moving player, without
having to explicitly examine the whole tree --- we can collapse certain
"families" of moves into single cases, for example. How do we get the
computer to do the same thing?

   Is there any way to get the computer to play smarter, other than
adding more and more special cases to the position-evaluation code?

I don't think so, other than making a general analysis.  Maybe there is 
some set of numerical values that can be calculated from a given 
system, and then the game reduces to Nim... that kind of thing.
