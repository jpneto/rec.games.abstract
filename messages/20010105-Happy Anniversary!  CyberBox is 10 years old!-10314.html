The original "CyberBox" game is now 10 years old!

How many of you reading this remember playing a 1991 DOS-based logic
game called CyberBox, written by a gentleman by the name of Doug
Beeferman?  Very few, I'm sure.


 From Doug's original CyberBox documentation file...

  CyberBox is a game of thinking ahead.  Given the
  simple challenge of getting from one point to
  another, you will find yourself anticipating the
  effects of every move you make in between.  There
  are 16 levels ("rooms") for you to solve.  The
  object of the game is to solve each room in the
  minimum number of moves, so as to attain the highest
  possible score.

If I remember correctly, I discovered CyberBox in early 1992 and by that
fall, since I enjoyed it so much, I found myself writing a sequel.  It
took a few years, but the result was

   "The Continuing Adventures of CyberBox"


which I am still receiving orders for to this day.  My own website on
this sequel, along with a copy of Doug's original game, can be found at:

   <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.inficad.com/~ecollins/ca-cyber.htm">http://www.inficad.com/~ecollins/ca-cyber.htm</a>

For those of you interested in logic games, you may want to take a look
at it.



Happy Anniversary Doug, wherever you are!
