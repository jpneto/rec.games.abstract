If you only value the popularity of a game, then abstract games, being
the least popular type of game, aren't worth too much.  But the
popularity of a game is the least important aspect to me.  The design
as something to behold has always been my focus.  Lately I've been
concentrating my efforts on geometric games.  The "golden eggs", if
you will, are these hexagonally tessellated, equal goals games in
which a filled board produces exactly one winner.  I don't care if
these games ever get played.  They have a value way beyond playability
and popularity to me.  These games do exist - in a big way.  They
aren't designed.  They're discovered.  And they exist even before
they're discovered. These golden eggs aren't very numerous.  The most
fundamental of the bunch - Hex, Y, and Lariat can be generalized in
different ways.  Looking at Hex, we saw that the perimeter can be
divided into more segments than just two black and two white.  This is
Atoll.  We also saw that Hex can be adapted to a surface with more
than one edge. This is Loophole.  Y and Lariat can be similarly
generalized.  You can also look at it from the perspective of the
shape, such as the mobius strip.  The goal here is to discover a rule
set for a win loss compatible game for that shape.  In the last month
I just swept up a bunch of these golden eggs and put them in a
basket.  There isn't anything major left to be discovered now - just a
bunch of quirky projective plane games.

They're just ideas floating out there
in the in ether.  Games that very few people play aren't worth much,
even if, as ideas, they are nice to behold.  A ruleset is like a seed:
basically pointless unless it becomes a tree.  I think that none of
us, including you, Mark, has made any real contribution to the world
of games, yet.  Maybe someday though.

If popularity is the only thing that matters to you, I have some news
that will hopefully cheer you up a little. Atoll, which has been on
Jijbent.nl since June, 2008 is catapulting through the ranks.  It's
already been played over 9000 times, recently surpassing Shogi and 9x9
Go, with Tablut, regular Go, and Oware soon to follow.  These games
have had years headstart - not to mention the fact that they're
classics.  A little further in the offing are Lines of Action and
Checkers.  Atoll is currently played on 5 games sites with the
certainty of more to come.  I get rave reviews about Atoll (and
Cephalopod) all the time.  Eventually, and it could take decades, I
believe Atoll will surpass Reversi at sites that have both games.
