The best possible turn based game site just got a little better.  As
as happened many times in the past, I suggested a game to Aaron Dalton
for SuperDuperGames and a few hours later it's programmed.  I don't
know how he does it.  He doesn't program every game I suggest, but
when he does, it can be dizzyingly fast.

Cage was burning a hole in my pocket, and now my cellphone is going to
be burning a hole in my pocket.  SDG is fully cellphone compliant.

Oust was added to SDG the day I printed the rule sheet, if I remember
correctly, and Aaron recently added an 11x11 size for it, down from
19x19.

I've got standing challenges for Cage and Oust at SuperDuperGames.
Cya there.
