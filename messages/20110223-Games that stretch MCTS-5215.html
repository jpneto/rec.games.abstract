Hi,

I'm doing a bit of work on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which is a
new AI approach for move planning in games. The algorithm behaves
differently for games with different characteristics - some games are
well suited to it while some resist it - and I'm interested in finding
the outliers.

Can anyone suggest games of reasonable complexity that exhibit the
following properties:

1. Unusually slow to calculte legal moves for a given position.
2. Unusually slow to apply a move to a given board state.
3. Fast to find Nth legal move (e.g. Gomoku).
4. Slow to find Nth legal move (e.g. Triskelion?).
5. Fast to perform short lookahead (e.g. 2 ply) on a given position
(e.g. Gomoku again).
6. Slow to perform short lookahead on a given position.
7. Unusually low branching factor.
8. Unusually high branching factor.
9. Long move sequences for either player (e.g. Chinese Checkers).
10. Delayed reward, i.e. positional strength not clear until the end
of the game (e.g. Omega, maybe Othello?).
11. Immediate reward, i.e. immediate positional evaluation is a good
indication of who will win.
12. Random playouts give good estimate of who will win.
13. Random playouts give poor estimate of who will win.
14. Games in which a win or loss is never far away, i.e. high ratio of
leaf nodes in the search tree (Palago?).
15. Games in which a win or loss is very remote at the beginning but
gets closer as the game progresses (Hex?).

Basically any game that will affect the performance of MCTS/UCT by its
very nature.

Thanks,
Cameron
