Nice solution! This is the same idea as for the "black path game"
discussed in Winning ways.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
White imagines covering the nonempty squares by a set of dominos, each 
containing one black and one white stone.  When black moves a stone out 
of its domino, white moves the other stone from the same domino so that 
the two moved stones can again be covered by a domino.  In this way, 
white can avoid ever running out of moves.

So it's either a draw or a second player win...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In this starting setup yes. But with some other starting setup, for
example letting the 2nd square in the first row be empty, it is not
possible to split the board into dominoes. Also, it is not possible to
arrange the pieces in a pattern as nice as yours, but maybe it makes a
playable game...

The best way to see if it works is really to write a program for
Zillions of games to play it.
