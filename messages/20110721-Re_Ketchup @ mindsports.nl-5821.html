That's funny, Squeeze (from my twin games Swish&amp;Squeeze) was named
Morro before that. I dropped the name because the current names
reflect the two different capture mechanisms.http://mindsports.nl/index..php/the-pit/553-swish-squeeze

Cool.  I wasn't aware of this game. Although: doesn't allowing one
player to control the opening set up give her the advantage, in the
sense that she can study the opening setup she uses at length before
the game starts, but her opponent can't?

Yes, precisely. You can create your own set of positions that you know
how to play from both sides.

Exactly. for this reason, the game is coolish.  Players don't take the
lead often, which is why it's really only for a small board.  I'm in
the middle of a match on a big board and though I've found some
strategy during the loooooong opening phase,  It's way better once
things get crowded.

Yes, that may be an argument for a modest boardsize.

It's the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player to achieve a row of a given length to claim
that score.  i.e. If I'm first to 6, then you must get 7 before the
board fills, or I win.

I find that not quite as elegant as Ketchup's rule. Did you consider
the next longest row? Of course you did, so what made you decide
otherwise?
