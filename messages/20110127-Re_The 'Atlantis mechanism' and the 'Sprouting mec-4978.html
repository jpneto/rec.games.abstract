Well, I registered my grudge about the perceived similarity, and that's all
I had to say about it.   Monkey Queen helped inspire your new design.   I'm
not going to endlessly mope about it like mopey Bill Taylor, still moping
about a childlike prank from three months ago.

I'm actually interested to give Cyclix a try.  My designs will never stray
far from the combinatorial style.  They won't venture too far into
Chess-likeness because I don't understand Chess well enough.  I'd be out of
my element selecting knights, rooks, etc. and where to place them.  Cyclix
seems ideally suited for the iggc sandbox if you want to give it a whirl.
