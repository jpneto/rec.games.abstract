Ralf Gering was the moderator of the Yahoo group, stacking-games, until
he recently quit in a big huff.  Before he left he deleted a huge
number of files, and allegedly changed settings or some such, making it
impossible for some members to make posts.  Ralf is otherwise an
intelligent, articulate individual who has made many valuable
contributions in the area of abstract game discussions.  But in this
case I've never seen such a monumental temper tantrum.  A three year
old has more self control.

Here is a quote from Ralf in message 821 from the Yahoo group,
abstractgames (a message which has since been deleted by the moderator
[I'm guessing Ralf Gering]):

"I admire Mark Steere.  He is one of the most brilliant people who ever
lived on our planet.  He invented Impasse and Tanbo.  Tanbo is like a
game from another universe, absolutely fascinating.  Now he has created
Byte:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.bytegame.com/">http://www.bytegame.com/</a>

Try it!

Ralf"

That was the rational side of Ralf.  Of course I don't deserve the
accolades.  The real smart ones are the hard core gamers who beat me at
my own games on their first or second try, after I've been constantly
play testing for months.

Now, just recently another post by Ralf in the Yahoo group,
stacking-games, which post has also since been removed:

"I really believe that you [Mark Steere] need some stong moderation.
You're
spreading and defending stereotypes. You try to silence criticism of
a game inventor [Christian Freeling] who thru his own offensive web
site makes himself a
public person. You try to remove Bashni players from this forum by
suggesting a split. You want to remove the moderator [Ralf Gering] who
invited you
to this forum a few days ago,

.. . .

Your behavior is well-known among
moderators. I also know that a group in which nobody dares to write
about controversial matters will certainly die because nothing is
more deadly than boredom.

Don't take it personal but I firmly believe that the group needs your
messages to be moderated.

Ralf"

Good God, man!  Get a grip!  What you were basically doing was imposing
strict rules of etiquette on everybody, and then flagrantly violating
your own rules with exhaustive, bitter tirades against Christian
Freeling over material that he wrote (I'm guessing) years ago.  You
abused your position as moderator by turning an otherwise health group
into your own mental bully pulpit.

Some types of groups need to be strictly moderated.  Abstract games
isn't one of them.  With your heightened sensitivity to ethnic
stereotypes, lording over an abstract game group with an iron fist does
nothing to dispel the myth that Germans are Nazis.

Moderate that !!

Mark Steere
