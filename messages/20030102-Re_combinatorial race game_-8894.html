Your basic combinatorial game is defined as a two player
 perfect information game in which the player who is
unable to move loses.  Sprouts fits (or is close to
fitting) that definition.

Analysis of combinatorial games often focuses around
positions in which different parts of the board can be
independently analyzed, because the play in one area can
no longer influence play in another area.  Unfortunately,
these strategies don't work often in chess and many other
games.

I was pondering a variation on the winning condition,
which may be fruitful for analyzing games.  Instead of
having the player lose who cannot move, a player wins by
closing achieving a local goal before the other player
reaches their goal.  That is, the game is more of a race.
Each move is either to progress to the finish, or to
block/hinder the other player from finishing.  In a
simple game, these are independent choices.  In a more
complex game, there may be interaction between the goals.

Has this kind of game been studied mathematically? I'm
thinking connection games, chess games, and others would
be illuminated by this study.

The games Teeko, Dao and my own Neutreeko all have a few
pieces of each colour that move around on a small board,
and the object is to arrange them in a certain way. I have
written java-programs that give a full analysis of all of
them (with a simplification for Teeko), in case you are
interested: Visit my web page <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.neutreeko.com">http://www.neutreeko.com</a> and
