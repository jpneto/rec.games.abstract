Chinook won 1, drew 31 and lost 0.
I heard Chinook was running on a different computer.
Anybody have details on the Chinook computer ?
When is the next tournament the Chinook computer
scheduled to play?

Chinook was running on an SGI Challenge, 8 processors with
512 MB of RAM.  Ken Thompson kindly lent us his machine and
put in many hours of work on our behalf.

Chinook won only one game of the 32, but was never in trouble
in any of the games.  Lafferty was under pressure in several
games but found the best moves.

In 1992, Chinook had a very small opening book, and it cost
us a few games against Tinsley.  For 1994/95, we built a
massive opening book.  This worked well at reducing our probability
of losing, but inadvertently reduced our chances of winning.
Many of the mainlines in the book were familiar to Lafferty
(and Tinsley) and all he had to do was play book moves to draw.
As a result, most of the games were quick, boring draws.
We had surprises in roughly 33% of the openings, but failed to 
get the right openings drawn as often as we would have liked to.
In the one game we won, Chinook played a surprise on move 4
and Lafferty failed to handle it correctly.  Interestingly, this
move was added to the book just two days before the match started.

Tinsley wants to play us a match (as the the challenger!), possibly
later this year.  All our efforts are on increasing the number of
new moves in the opening book.
