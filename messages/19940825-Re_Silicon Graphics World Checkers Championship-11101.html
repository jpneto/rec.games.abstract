Wrong! Already such a forum exists - postal chess. I think you
will find that the games in postal chess are at a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> high level
(the top players that is...). In fact, if you doubt this then take
your best computer (Deep Thought, or whatever) and see how it fares
in a top flight postal tourney. I am willing to bet it'd come in
a solid last place. However, take those same postal players and
sit them down at a board under normal tourney conditions against DThought 
and DT would probably score its fair share of pts.

The reason the game isn't played this way is that it isn't particularly
useful, not because it would confer some tremendous advantage.

Again, I refer you to postal chess. Humans are allowed opening manuals
and to use the board. This is the closest setting to truly fair
playing conditions between human and machine. In fact, were a computer
to win the world postal championsip I'd have to say that it had
done so completely fairly. I might not say the same thing if
a computer won a normal OTB world championsip for reasons such as
opening book and ending book stored on disk etc. Of course, this is
all a moot point until computers get significantly better at chess
since they presently offer no real threat to win the World Championship
at any time control other than blitz.
