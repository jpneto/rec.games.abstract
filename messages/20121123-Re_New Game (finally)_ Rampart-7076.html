Update. I just played a game of Rampart on a hex hex and it might even be better than the original. I don't know how I overlooked this. It seems like it is less tactical than square Rampart and might have a lot more variety in strategy. Although it is slower paced and perhaps not as fun. Another plus however is that with 6 degrees of connectivity it may only need one variant for all sizes. Here's the game in the sandbox. One downside is that the filling in phase is more likely to arise than in the square version. I'll have to investigate further. Also 140+ moves isn't bad considering I only started with 12 groups on the board. I'm not sure the best way to arrange the pieces however. The board might need to be a hex tessellated rectangle shape. As for the initial arrangement you'll notice the stones start in clusters, I did this because I figured it would enhance tactics and speed up and direct the gameplay as these stones are already very vulnerable in this configuration.
