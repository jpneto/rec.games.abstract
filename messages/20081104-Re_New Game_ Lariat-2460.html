No offense intended, Bill, but it should be clear from the diagram
that the closed end is simply a hexagonally tessellated, regular hexagon.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ah - got it now - my fault for not reading the explanation properly.

But may I stress again, Mark, as others have done; without intending
offense, that figures 1, 2 &amp; 3 are unnecessarily inviting people to
make the mistake, and should perhaps be deleted altogether
from the page.  It would mean extending those diagrams
with extra "flanges" like the main diagram, fig 5, has,
so more work for you, but they needn't extend the full distance,
just enough to show the nature of things.

Anyway, it's obviously not at all certain yet, what the appropriate
ratio between cap-size and cylinder length should be, to make it
a fair game, and would need a lot of playing to determine this.

The situation would be rather similar to modern Go, where
the size of "komi" is constantly changing, increasing, as play
makes it clearer what it should be.  OC in the game of Go there is
a lot of innate Japanese conservatism and institutional conservatism
to overcome as well.  One of the advantages of new games is
that this element is absent.  Perhaps your rule sheet could
emphasize this "experimental" aspect more?

The whole point of applying the lariat principle to a cylinder was to
make the end, center cell no more valuable than any other cell -
certainly not "key".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sure, I see the point of that now.       It is still a "special" cell
OC,
but that's inevitable because of the win criterion.  It is also worth
noting, though scarcely important, that there are also some other
special cells - those six at the top of the cylinder that have only
5 neighbors rather than the usual six.  Presumably this makes
them very marignally less valuable, though I doubt it would be
all that detectable in play, any more than it is in Projex etc.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I have to strongly disagree with you there, Bill.  Lariat isn't even
distantly related to Hex beyond the fact that they're both connection
games played on a hexagonally tessellated board,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, that "beyond" rather effectively destroys the force
of your "distantly related", but it's not worth arguing about.
Certainly your game is a lot further from Hex than I first thought.

Also, I agree with your comments about large-scale equalisations
as in Unlur - they give a game a completely different tone.
But such things are all part of the fun of the great ocean of abstract
games that we are all swimming in.  And it may be a necessary
evil that we have to consider equalisation, but even considering it
an evil, necessitating reduction to a minimum, it is thus even more
urgent to allow a long period of experimentation to determine how
to do it, such as adjusting your ratios.

I know you like to present a "completed effort", but without either
equalisation or experimentation, this is a forlorn hope.

Anyway, keep up the good work; and I was charmed by your
account of inventing games, focus, etc.  It's not the way I do it,
but it's obviously a good way.

Cheers!
