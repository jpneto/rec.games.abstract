Hi.  I would be very much interested in playing email WiffNProof.  I would
actually be interested in playing a number of email games, but WiffNProof
I feel would lend itself particularly well to email play - it would be
easy to communicate using text, there would be no question of honesty,
it's fiarly fast moving,  etc.  If anyone wants, I can email them a set of
rules so we could play, tho be forewarned that an explanation of the game
might be lengthy and confusing.  The rules are very simple, tho, and would
probably be right up the alley of programmers.  The gameplay is kinda like
poker, but you construct logical arguments instead of good card hands.  I
don't know where you'd get a set; I mailordered mine from GAMES magazine
years ago; they voted it one of the best games of the year then.  But you
don't need a set to play an email game, just a good set of rules.  By the
way, the ruleset that comes with the game kinda sucks; I think it could be
better written.  If you get lost reading it, it's not you, it's the
author.  If you are interested in playing, email me.
                                                                    Greg
