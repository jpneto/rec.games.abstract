<br><blockquote type=cite>A friend and I thought this up in our math class.&nbsp; The basic idea was
<br>to produce a game with the following conditions:
<br>
<br>1.&nbsp; Possible instant wins.
<br>2.&nbsp; Very few pieces.
<br>3.&nbsp; Structural inability to block with your own pieces.&nbsp; (partially
<br>fulfilled)
<br>
<br>And here it is, we call it "Ergo".
<br>
<br>Play begins on a 4x4 board with each player controlling 4 pieces, the
<br>pieces are arranged in the following layout.&nbsp; "-" is an open square,
<br>"x" is a black piece, and "o" is a white piece.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4&nbsp; - - - -
<br>3&nbsp; x o x o
<br>2&nbsp; o x o x
<br>1&nbsp; - - - -
<br>
<br>Movement rules(applying to all moves):
<br>
<br>1.&nbsp; No two pieces can occupy the same square.
<br>2.&nbsp; A piece may not land in the same square twice during any part of
<br>its turn, however, it may jump over the square more than once in any
<br>given turn.
<br>3.&nbsp; If a piece performs any <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>jumping<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> move, he may perform another
<br>legal jumping move provided he lands in a square adjacent to the piece
<br>he wishes to jump.
<br>
<br>A player may move in the following ways:
<br>
<br>4.&nbsp; One square orthoganally or diagonally.
<br>5.&nbsp; Over a single piece, in a jumping fashion, orthoganally or
<br>diagonally.
<br>6.&nbsp; Over a piece "bouncing" off the wall, such that he lands in a
<br>square 90 degrees away from the piece, in the direction of the bounce.
<br>&nbsp;It is easiest to think of this rule as pieces moving in a certain
<br>direction, and retaining that inertia until they land in the desired
<br>square, making them available to jump again in the direction they
<br>desire.
<br>Example:
<br>&nbsp; a b c d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a b c d&nbsp; 
4 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - - - -
<br>3 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; 3 - - o -
<br>2 - - - x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - - - x
<br>1 - - o -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - -
<br>White to play can jump from c1, over d2, "bouncing" off the wall into
<br>c3, but he could not jump back to c1 over d2 as he's already been in
<br>that square.
<br>&nbsp; 
&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - - -
<br>3 - - - -
<br>2 - - x o
<br>1 - - - -
<br>Black in this example cannot jump from c2, over d2, back into c2
<br>because it would place him in the same square twice.
<br>
<br>7.&nbsp; A piece may also bounce over a corner piece provided he is
<br>orthoganally adjacent to it.&nbsp; This move causes the piece to take on
<br>the direction of the other wall touching the opposing piece.
<br>Example:
<br>&nbsp; a b c d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. c1-d1-d2 (notation includes
<br>covered
<br>3 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squares, whether a
<br>piece
<br>2 - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - - - o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jumps or lands on a
<br>square.)
<br>1 - - o x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - x
<br>
<br>8.&nbsp; Any piece in jumping motion may "slide" over another piece,
<br>provided he keeps his same direction during the entire "slide".
<br>Example:
<br>&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - - -&nbsp; White can play 1. c3-d2-d1-b2 or 1. d3-d2-d1-c1-b1&nbsp; 
3 - - o o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but not 1. c3-d2-d1-c1-b2 and not 1. d3-d2-c1-b2
<br>2 - - - x
<br>1 - - x x
<br>
<br>&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - x -&nbsp; A slide can also include multiple bounces, for instance,
<br>white can
<br>3 - x - o&nbsp; play 1.d3-c4-b3-a2-b1-c2-b3-a4.&nbsp; (Which is a triple-bounce
<br>slide to
<br>2 x - - -&nbsp; c2 followed by a jump over b3.)
<br>1 - x - -
<br>
<br><b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Remember<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that a piece can be jumped over twice, but a player cannot
<br><span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>land<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> in the same square twice in the same turn.
<br>
<br>Those are all the movement rules, they are the most difficult part to
<br>learn.
<br>
<br>Scoring rules:
<br>1.&nbsp; Play continues until eight points are scored by one player.
<br>2.&nbsp; Single jumps and non jumping moves score zero points.
<br>3.&nbsp; Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 2 pieces in a
<br>single turn scores one point.
<br>4.&nbsp; Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 3 pieces in a
<br>single turn scores two points.
<br>5.&nbsp; Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) 4 non-distinct
<br>pieces in a single turn scores four points.
<br>6.&nbsp; Covering (by way of jumping, bouncing or sliding) all 4 of the
<br>opponents pieces in a single turn wins the game instantly.
<br>7.&nbsp; If three moves are repeated in a row, or a series of moves
<br>repeated three times in a row, play is considered a draw, regardless
<br>of either players points.&nbsp; (No games played so far have ended in a
<br>draw, but please share if it happens to you)
<br>
<br>Notationally, after a turn, you would write in parenthesis the total
<br>points scored by a player, with W representing an instant win.
<br>
<br>The movement rules can be very confusing, so if you have any
<br>questions, please post here and i'll try to answer them for you.
<br>
<br>Here is a sample beginning for you.&nbsp; It would be fairly easy to follow
<br>on a chess/checker board with pawns/checkers.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - - -&nbsp; 
3 x o x o
<br>2 o x o x
<br>1 - - - -
<br>
<br>&nbsp;White&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black
<br>1. b3-b4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c3-c2!
<br>
<br>White threatened two double lines on b3 and c3.&nbsp; Blacks counter looks
<br>like it gives White advantage, but after 2. b4-b3-b2-b1 (1) black
<br>plays ...b3-a2-b1-c2-d4-c4 (W) and after 2. b4-a3-b2-c1-d2-c3 (2)
<br>Black wins with ...b3-a2-b1-c2-d3-c4-c3-c2-c1 (W)
<br>
<br>2. b4-a3-b2-c1 (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>White decides to score a point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b3-a2-b1-c1-d1 (2)
<br>
<br>Black counters with two points, and would have liked to move back to
<br>b3, but can't because he started on that square.
<br>
<br>The following position is reached with W=1 and B=2 with white set to
<br>win one point by c1-b2-a3-b4(1) or c1-d2-c3-b2-a1(1)
<br>&nbsp; a b c d
<br>4 - - - -
<br>3 x - - o
<br>2 o x o x
<br>1 - - o x
<br>
<br>
<br>I'm not going to use any more of this game, because I just wanted to
<br>illustrate some actual play, but if you have any questions at all ,
<br>please ask, and i'll try to help you out as soon as I can (could be a
<br>few days.)&nbsp; The game is very fun, and the strategy is surprisingly
<br>elusive.&nbsp; Have fun with this one.
