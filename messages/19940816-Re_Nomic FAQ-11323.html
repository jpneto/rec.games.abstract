The Nomic FAQ has been updated to correct and amend the info about the
individual games in on the Net. Particularly, Valpo (The One True Nomic) 
now has a WWW site, included in its description.

Thanx to everyone who has bothered to send their comments about the FAQ.
Please publicise the FAQ to anyone who is interested, as it is not much
use if noone reads it. In particular, feel free to add links to it from 
other WWW sites, or in other FAQs.

Also, would somebody please relay this posting to alt.fan.hofstadter,
as this site no longer carries that newsgroup (growl).

Malcolm
