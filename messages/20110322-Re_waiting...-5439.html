About the voting: I like Dee's method best so I'm going to use that.
If anyone actually in the contest wants to contend or if I have some
crazy epiphany then I'll re-evalutate, but I trust that it's a good
method.  I don't mind the slightly extra work and I look forward to
telling Dee that we used the method she so thoughtfully suggested.

In other news we had our Abstract workshop tonight at the Spielwiese.
13 people came!!!!  I can prove it too.  I took a video camera :)
Now there are 6 definite judges and 3 prospective judges with a
possibility of more from that group.  As we have extended the vote
announcement to after I get back from Ireland everything is running
pretty smoothly and the new folks are eager to try all the games.

A nice thing about tonight was that I didn't play hardly any games.
Instead I walked around making sure that people were playing by the
correct rules.  I didn't get any video of an entire game.  I more just
scanned the various people and games that were being played at
different times.  We filled 4 tables at one point which is unheard of
at the abstracts workshop.  really... It's normally just me and Dave.
Actually It's always just me and Dave :)
