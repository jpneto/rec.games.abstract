A Game We Used To Play With Our Legos



     You see, my mom had this rug in the living room which had big
squares on it, so Miles and I would each build two structures out of our
lego, a "Tank" and a "Tower," each with a "cross-shot" in it.  A cross-shot
was a block-propulsion device which would shoot a lego block with a rubber 
band.

     Each turn could be used either to move the tank or fire a shot.

     The shot could be fired from either the tank or the tower.

     The winner was the first player to disable the other player's tower.

     Repairs to the tower could not be made during a game

     Rules governing repairs to the tank varied widely




     The use of slanted pieces and curved pieces from the model kits was
either permitted or prohibited, for interesting variants.

     A patent for this use of Lego blocks has been applied for.  If your
children would like to play this game, reply to this message for an
informational packet on How To Apply For A Liscencing Agreement.

     Or just send me your credit card number and expiration date.
