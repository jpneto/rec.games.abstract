Chess isn't all that popular in <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>western<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> europe. When a star from a
given country is rising (you know who I'm thinking of right now, I
hope?), it gets a little attention in the media, but nothing long-term
or in-depth.

In eastern europe, however, abstract strategy games seem to be a lot
more popular. This may be related to boredom (like, fewer things to do
on a saturday evening on account of communism and relative poverty),
or achievement (also related to communism, since many of the things we
might do in the west to get a sense of achievement would not be
avaliable there. This may also explain why there is such a high
academic standard in many EE countries).

I suspect these cultural trends related to years under communism will
fade eventually...

This may just be one big rationalisation because I'm so far from
beating the guys who play Hex at Kurnik ;-)
