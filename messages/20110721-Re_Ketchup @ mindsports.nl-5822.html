Yes, precisely. You can create your own set of positions that you know
how to play from both sides.

Aha. So it was intentional.

It's the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>first<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> player to achieve a row of a given length to claim

I find that not quite as elegant as Ketchup's rule. Did you consider
the next longest row? Of course you did, so what made you decide
otherwise?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I did. The problem with the "next longest row" idea is that when
applied to this game, draws are still possible, and on small boards,
probable.  Ketchup's version of the rule works because on a board with
an odd number of cells, there will be at least one pair of oppositely
colored groups which are different sizes. That's not true of rows in
Morro. The win condition I chose for Morro makes draws impossible and
I felt it was intuitive, since "get there first" is a common theme
that most people are used to in games.
