Maybe a post isn't all that interesting when I agree with most of the
two previous ones. Regarding Chess variants, I don't care if the come
in buckets, but I'm glad there are posters who have reached a similar
conclusion as Michael. If I may quote myself:

"So why bother unless it's fun. To me making a good chess variant was
mostly an excercise in implementing an interesting idea <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>within<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the
general context of checkmate."

Mark has little reason, I feel, to be touchy about Cyclix. It's not a
contender and it doesn't have the sprouting mechanism at it's core,
but mainly as a support mechanism for mutual capture between pieces
within the minimalistic Atlantis environment. In these games you can't
have pieces disappearing permanently because there are not enough
pieces for that. So you have to keep them on the board or recycle
them. The latter notion fell in with Mark's mechanism.
Cyclix doesn't <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>look<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> like MQ either: it looks like Shakti and Caïssa
and for good reasons. It's not a Grand Design but and exercise in
minimalism and a tactical playground for the fun of it. But of course
I've given MQ credits for providing the inspiration for the recycling
mechanism.

MQ itself is quite a different story in that it really creates a new
concept in the field of Chess variants. I hardly held that for
possible. I take it that the rules are now finalized, so I'll do
another set of graphics and see whether Ed can modify the applet.
