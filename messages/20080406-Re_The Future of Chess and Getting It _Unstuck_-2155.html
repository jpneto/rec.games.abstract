I have no problem
with different kinds of clocks, tournament scoring systems, rating

need to know to play a game against each other.  I also have no
problem with chess variants, or with one of the variants becoming
more popular than chess.  What I object to is someone trying to
change the rules that determine how the game is played.

Taking that statement literally, one might have expected you to
complain when the 50-move rule was modified to allow more moves in
some endgame positions proven by computer studies to require more than
50 moves to achieve mate.

That's an interesting thought. Had I been interested in FIDE rules
at the time I suspect that I would not have liked the change, and
as it turns out, FIDE ended up not liking it either.

For those who don't know what we are talking about, a recap:   

 In the FIDE Laws of Chess, published in 1984 and 1988, the 50-move
 rule was extended to 75 moves for the following positions:

 King + Rook + Bishop against King + Rook;
 King + 2 Knights against King + pawn;
 King + Queen + pawn one square from promotion against King + Queen;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Knights;
 King + Queen against King + 2 Bishops;
 King + 2 Bishops against King + Knight

 In 1992 during the FIDE Congress in Manila the Rules Committee
 suggested establishing one rule for all endings: 50 moves, and
 the General Assembly of FIDE approved the change.  In 1996 the
 Congress in Yerevan revisited the decision and kept the 1992
 rules.  There are currently no exceptions to the 50-move rule.

But I presume you mean that if someone wants his chess variant to
become more popular than chess, you want it to happen honestly, by
popular demand - not by bribing someone at the USCF, as it were, to
hijack the existing infrastructure built up by people who joined it in
order to play Chess the way it is.

I have no problems with that position; I admire honesty and detest
sneakiness in general.

Exactly what I was thinking. Thanks!

But there is another side to that argument. When they brought in the
rule about drawing for the first two, and then three, moves of
Checkers, it wasn't because someone wanted to egotistically put his
stamp on the game. It was because there was a problem generally
recognized as existing by the Checkers community.

You always bring up such interesting points!  I was about to write
something along the line of "Unless I am mistaken, it also didn't 
change the basic rules that you and I would be playing by if we 
decided to sit down and play a game of checkers", so I did a quick
search for the official checkers rules.  Even after narrowing down
the search to "Standard American Checkers" (look at all the regional
variations at [ <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts</a> ], most of
which appear to be recognized at [ <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.fmjd.org/site.php">http://www.fmjd.org/site.php</a> ]! ),
I can't seem to find the random opening rule.

If Chess players worldwide recognize that Chess has problems similar
in magnitude, then for the existing Chess federations to get directly
involved with experimentation with Chess variants in an attempt to
find a solution to the problems would be a legitimate activity. I'm
dubious that the problems are, yet, that serious, and that a Chess
variant would be effective in addressing them, but in principle this
can be as legitimate in the Chess world as it was in the Checkers
world.

That makes sense.  Let us hope that the FIDE and USCF are run by
same people when that day comes...

better is another example.)

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Another<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> fascinating sub-topic! I was vaguely aware of this, so
I just did a web search.  What I find most interesting is that,
despite a lot of disagreement about this, the writing is much 
clearer and the points made with far better logic that what I 
just saw searching on checkers rules. I suspect that Go attracts
people with more analytical temperaments.
