Sounds intriguing.  The "talk" part is gonna be hard, though.  Have you
decided what words you will allow during the discussion phase?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm working on that. At the current time, however, there will be no robot
players, so people can talk how they like.

Also, I'm not sure how the voting works, from the way you described it.
Does everyone get this prompt upon the voting phase?

 Do you vote to accept all proposals other than your own (y/n/a)?

Or this prompt?

 Do you vote to accept all proposals from Player 1 (y/n/a)?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

More like the second, but closer to this:

  Do you vote to accept proposal 1 from player 1 (y/n/a)?
  Do you vote to accept proposal 2 from player 1 (y/n/a)?
  Do you vote to accept proposal 3 from player 1 (y/n/a)?

etc.... for each proposal for each player. Maybe that's a bit tooooooooo
much (even tho I planned on keeping proposals for players to about 3, with
20 players that becomes 60 votes!). Now that I think about it, the second
way that you mentioned sounds like fun (do you vote for player 3's proposals,
knowing that proposal 1 may help you but proposal 3 may hurt???)

Finally, if you take requests from news as well as email, sign me up!
This sounds like it could be fun.  :-)

Certainly. I have your name in record. If I get enough (let's say a
minimum of 5-6, maximum of 20), I will let you know.
