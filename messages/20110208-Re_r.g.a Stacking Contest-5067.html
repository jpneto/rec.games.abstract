OH FUCK THAT!  My understanding was a game submission earned you a vote..  I
did a lot of groundwork before the contest clearing out ass weeds like Bill
Taylor and Harald Korneliussen, etc.  The contest wouldn't even have been
possible without that.  Now they and their sockpuppets are going to come
back and vote on my game?  I don't think so.  Count Monkey Queen the fuck
out if that's how it's going to be.

Who's ever heard of a contest where only the entrants get to vote?
Sure there's a history between many of us but that applies just as
much to the entrants as it does to anyone else. Furthermore entering
the contest hardly means anything about your character. I suspect the
result of only allowing contestants to vote will be a slew of slapdash
games entered just to allow their "designers" to vote in the contest.
In fact I would encourage people to do so just to make a mockery of
such an absurd voting system. I know that I will vote for whichever
game I deem to be the strongest entry. Hopefully everyone else will do
the same. If the environment of the abstract games is so toxic that we
need to shut people out of the contest then maybe a contest just
wasn't meant to be... I have potential detractors too, I believe I'm
still on bad terms with Michael Howe. I don't think Michael would vote
against me out of spite...

I'm also calling for transparent voting.  I don't want to get a D+ for
Monkey Queen and hear a lot of kiss-ass "Oh I gave Monkey Queen an A, Mark!
Everyone else gave it an F!"  If this turns into a testicularly challenged
event, I'm withdrawing Monkey Queen.

No offense Mark, but you would. I for one don't like it (on its own
that is). I think it's just poor sportsmanship to enter a contest,
expect to have a vote and then not even properly review the other
entries. Unless you have the divinity of a Chris Freeling (no you're
not off the hook CF ;) ) all you can gauge  from a game's rules is its
architecture and maybe some vague tactical ideas. Whether or not
playing each entry is a stipulation of having a vote I personally
intend to play them all at least once otherwise I wont feel as though
I've earned to right to vote. It seems no better to me than a judge in
a pumpkin growing contest at a county fair locating a portable toilet
to jerk off in after looking at the first pumpkin. I think ideally
voters should have to play each entry at least once however I realize
this is an unreasonable expectation given some people have busy
schedules.

Hate it.  This seems like more ass kissing fodder.  "Oh I dutifully played
every game so now my vote is worth a lot more than everyone else's."  Fuck
that.  How are you going to ensure that someone played the game, or that
they weren't just mindlessly making moves if they did play the game?  I had
a guy tell me after playing me in Jostle that all of his moves had simply
been the first move on the drop down list.  How much extra credit do you get
for that?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I really like this idea Daniel. Now despite what Mark says I think
it's safe to say that if someone goes out of their way to play one of
the games that they will give it a fair shot. But indeed it does seem
hard to verify if people are telling the truth when they claim to have
played an entry. The only way we could be sure is if the games were
played online but that hardly seems fair to games like Stax that will
require more impractical methods to play test. Maybe we could get
voters to write quick game session summaries or to write some sort of
analysis that would demonstrate a certain level of understanding of
the game.

yeah it sure is pretty but it seems kind of pointless to me, unless
you're into that new age shit... I don't really care. If I don't have
my entry prepared by march 20th it aint coming.
