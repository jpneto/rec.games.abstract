You can define a "step" in playing ability so, that
you can beat 75% of opponents which are one step below.

Than you can define the "complexity" of a game as
the number of steps in existence in the population

40 steps, chess and other games only 12.

I agree that chess has about 10-12 'levels' or steps.  For example, a
player with a 1000 rating (a low, but legitimate rating) will lose about
75% of the time to a player rated 1200, who will lose about 75% of the
time to a 1400 rated player... etc., all the way up to 2800, a mark only
a few elite Grandmasters have ever achieved.

I've also read much on the estimate on the number of levels GO has, but
alas, I know very little about GO and can't give my own opinion on that
one.  40 seems awful high, however.  My gut feeling is the number may
actually be closer to half that.  If not, that's great!  40 levels...
wow!

You may be familiar with Mark Thompson's wonderful article, "Defining
the Abstract."

If not, this article mentions this very idea... that in his opinion, for
an abstract game to have lasting value, it should indeed have 'levels',
thus giving it 'depth.'   If a game has such, the "game has lasting
interest because the player continues to learn how to improve his play
for a long time."

If you write to David Bush, (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:twixt@cstone.net">twixt@cstone.net</a>) a gentleman who has been
hooked on Twixt since 1967, and who has written numerous articles on the
game, I'll bet he would be happy to give you his opinion on how many
levels he feels Twixt has.  Let me know what he says... I'm curious.
