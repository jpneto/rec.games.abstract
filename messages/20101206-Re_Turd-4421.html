Here's my new game "Turd". It is played on an 8x8 board. Each player
has two pieces, one has "Bills", the other "Coreys".

You forgot to mention the "Freeling" piece, so-called because it
can be Freely introduced onto the board by any player,

The "Freeling piece" in Bill's twisted logic is any world renowned abstract
game designer, and the "board" is rec.games.abstract.  Yes, the Freeling
piece can be freely introduced here.  In fact, it doesn't even need an
introduction.  It can just show up unannounced.

The Freeling piece has no obligation to pay homage to group oaf, Bill
Taylor.

The Freeling piece can talk freely about whatever it wants in
rec.games.abstract, including games of its own design, games of other
designers, and parody games such as Turd that happen to feature "Bills"
leaving a trail of shit behind them.  Even you can see the irony in that,
right Bill?  :D

No?  Too touchy?? lol

Bill, the only thing exploding around here is you exploding into your
already shit filled diaper.  Your exhaustive struggle to whip up drama in
rec.games.abstract is flagging.

You tried to subjugate Christian Freeling and he kneed you in the groin. 
End of story.  Nobody feels sorry for you, Bill.   Oh the abuses you've
suffered at the brutal hand of Christian Freeling! lol
