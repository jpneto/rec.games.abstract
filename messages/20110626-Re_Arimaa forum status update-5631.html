Goat fucker Omar finally managed to block one of my IPs, lol.  His
burqa is still trembling, courtesy of Christian Freeling squatting
under it. 

Christian Freeling's burqa muffled voice:

"YEAH!! BLOCK MORE IPs!!!!  BLOCK MORE IPs!!!!"

I'm not sure what I did to invoke such fear and loathing other than
try to engage Christian Freeling in topics he initiated. 

The whole time Christian was spewing his "convergent Symple" nonsense,
he was calling for "content".

"I've been waiting for any content oriented commentary, but to no
avail."

"Surely you can do better than that, even if it means actually
contemplating content."

"And I would indeed welcome content related input."

When I presented my comprehensive "Symple Logic" proof, Christian
Freeling responded:

"A good summary of your arguments. Nothing beyond common knowledge and
nothing I wouldn't acknowledge right away."

Fine.  Game over.  But no!!  A week later he starts spewing the same
magical Symple horse shit again!!

"To keep this on target, what I'm saying about Symple's and Sygo's
move order advantage balancing mechanism is that, given a regular
boardsize, it isn't possible to argue one way or another. I'm not
talking about "the truth" because the truth, although known to
exist...."

[Snip Christian Freeling hurling red herring filled barrels, Donkey
Kong style]

At least I got Christian to acknowledge board size for the first time.
 Now the whole magical Symple theory teeters on a "regular" board
size, lol.  There's no end to the nonsense.   Unfortunately that's as
close as Christian Freeling ever got to coherency before totally
abandoning the magical Symple hogwash, at least for the moment. 

Apparently Christian wants "content" from dolts, not people who
specialize in finite-decisive game design like me. 

Megafucknutz in the Arimaa forum:

"It's actually fairly obvious what [Christian Freeling's] talking
about where if you stop to think about it for two seconds."

Christian Freeling's burqa muffled voice:

 "SCORE!!!!  Don't block HIS ip Omar!! LOL"
