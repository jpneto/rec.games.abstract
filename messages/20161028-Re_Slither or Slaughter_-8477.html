Today in bgg crappy game designers are attempting to recycle their crappy games instead of working on new concepts.
ha ha ha 
"The non commutative game product" ha ha ha 

Now they are trying to wear "mathematical clothes". It will not give any credibility to a crappy game. You could put it in any package it will remain crappy game.
And the more stupid thing is to create games for 2 or 3 guys.
I have designed games such as I`m maybe the only one who could understand and play them. Those games are not designed to be published. It will be nonsense. I play them ALONE.
"Game designers" in bgg are simply incompetent.
Recycling, plagiarizing, wrapping in some pseudo-scientific" package their games to make them attractive (they attract only dumb guys who know nothing about maths, physics or sciences in general).
No one will impress me by his "mathematical" background (Cameron Brown, Taylor or anyone else).
Creating games (in particular abstract games) require one thing : huge imagination. That`s it.
