As I say, I don't actually have an opinion on whether Tamsk is good or
not - I merely admire the originality of it's central concept.

I like Burm's games more than you do though.  Even though they're
missing some of the qualities that abstract game designers strive for,
and even though they often have features I outright detest (the choice
between a random set up or a tedious deterministic set-up phase), I
still find most of them compelling to play.  There's something I like
about them that I can't describe, which isn't captured the usual
criteria by which I evaluate games.  As I suspect I'm about to incur a
classic Mark Steere Beatdown (TM) for giving Burm too much credit,
I'll duck for cover now.
