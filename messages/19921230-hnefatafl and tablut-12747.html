While waiting for Ed Dengler to post his collection of hnefatafl
variants, I could not resist the temptation of giving him some help ...

First of all, although hnefatafl (or simply tafl) is often referred to as 
a Viking board game, it is even older than the Vikings. According to
Murray(*) it was played in Scandinavia before AD 400.
For many centuries it was the only board game in Scandinavia. Thus,
the word tafl meant board game and only when other board games came along
became it necessary to name the specific game hnefatafl to distinguish it from
other board games. Hnefatafl was exported by Norsemen (vikings) to Iceland,
Britain, and Ireland, and was also the only board game played by the Saxons 
before chess was introduced in the eleventh century.

I don't know the correct English pronounciation, but in Norwegian tafl
should be pronounced 'tavl' with the 'a' as in English 'car'.
'hnefa' is probably straight forward with (almost) silent 'h'. I'll have to ask my 
Icelandic friend about this...

Unfortunately, the game of hnefatafl was forgotten except for some variants
in remote areas (see next section). It has not caught on after it was 
rediscovered either, I have never met a Norwegian (or anyone else) 
who plays hnefatafl.

The rules for the full 19x19 version of hnefatafl have already been
posted in this group. As a start, it is probably better to try the game of
tablut. Tablut is a variant of tafl played by the Lapps in Northern
Scandinavia on a 9x9 board. It was described by the famous botanic
Carl von Linne in 1732 after his trip to Lappland. The rules are exactly 
as in hnefatafl, execpt that the opening position is like this:

 . . . m m m . . .
 . . . . m . . . .
 . . . . s . . . .
 m . . . s . . . m
 m m s s S s s m m
 m . . . s . . . m
 . . . . s . . . .
 . . . . m . . . .
 . . . m m m . . .

The pieces labeled s are called the Swedes and the m's are called the 
Muscovites. The S is the king and the central cell is called the konakis
where only the king is allowed to enter.

Note that this game can be played on the lines/points of a chess board
and with chess or checkers pieces. Be sure to let the blond Swedes be white
and the dark Muscovites be black :-&gt;

Enjoy!
