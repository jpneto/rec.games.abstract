For those who have expressed an interest in 3-D chess, I have received
some more information from Mr. Bernard Kennedy, the inventor of a 3D
chess game being marketed in Ireland at the moment.  I enclose a copy
of the letter which I received from him recently.

While I have no business relationship with Mr. Kennedy, or his
company, I do know him personally, and would be happy to pass on any
email enquiries to him.

The game was launched relatively recently (last October, I believe),
and has been selling well here in Dublin.  Mind Games are currently
work on overseas contracts also.  A 3D chess club has also started up
recently in Dublin, and meets every two weeks.  So, the game seems to
have become quite popular.

3-Dimensional Chess is a game that has been tried several times in the
past and from several different countries and backgrounds.  The
problem with developing a successful version of the game is to create
a game that isn't too difficult or too easy to play.

Remember, to be faithful to chess, it must be challenging, but when
you introduce vertical motion into pieces, you immediately open up the
number of possible moves from tens of thousands in chess to millions
in a three dimensional equivalent.

In Mind Games' version, we establish two classes of piece: the upper
class that can either move in three dimensions, or like ordinary chess
pieces, and the lower class that cannot move up or down.

The playing surface consists of three 8x8 boards, one above another.
Each board has eight black and white pawns and pieces, giving each
player 24 pieces and 24 pawns.

This means that the rules of the game can be explained thoroughly to a
chess player within three minutes (with practice), while it takes
three or four games to become competent at the game.  The challenge of
3-Dimensional chess, after your fourth game isn't remembering how
pieces move, but it is in determining what would be the best strategy
to win.

We are keen to establish distribution agents in every country around
the world, and to translate the game into every language.  At the
moment, however, only an English version is available although we are
working on Japanese, French, German, Dutch and Spanish.

If you would like to purchase a game, please send IR pounds 29.95, or
Stg pounds 29.95, or US$ 39.95 or local currency equivalent to:

    Mind Games Manufacturing Limited,
    P.O. Box 3942
    Dublin 18
    Republic of Ireland.

and we will send you a game by mail by return.  The above cost
includes post and packing.  Alternatively, if you would like to
recommend us to a games distributer in you country, they can reach us
on +353 - 1 - 295 - 6041

Bernard Kennedy.
