2) One player is 'X', the other 'O'.  X goes first, and players take turns
marking a cell with their symbol.  To offset the advantage of X going first,
O is allowed to make two marks during one (just one) of her turns.  Once a
cell is marked, it cannot be marked again.  Play continues until all cells

I believe Torben is right in stating that this make the game a win for
O. A modification of the rules (which may or may not drastically alter
the game strategies) could be to allow X a double move after O has
made hers. This could be made a general rule - at any time, the player
in turn may mark two cells, if she has currently fewer marked cells
than her opponent.

Note that a deterministic game with no draw possible will always be a
certain win for one side, assuming perfect play. At best, variants of
Majominoes may be wins for different sides depending on initial setup
(board size, shape of regions etc.).

But this need not make it a bad game, as long as perfect play is hard
to do, both for humans and computers (unlike tic-tac-toe or Nim).

On a 5x5 board, the search space is small enough that a computer can
play perfectly, but I doubt this would be the case on a 9x9 board or
bigger. 7x7 will probably be O.K. as well.
