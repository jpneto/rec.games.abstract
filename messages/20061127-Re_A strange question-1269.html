As time-honored a game as Nine Men's Morris is, I don't know that
there's much literature available on it.  Everything I know about the

NMM has been "solved", so you should both be able to find a good AI to

I've found some decent computer programs for it.  The kind of
literature that's available might not be my cup of tea (e.g., I started
to read an online article on solving NMM, but it was far too dry and
heavy to hold my attention).

But that's OK, because I realize that I have another bad habit besides
failing to think things through:  I rely too much on reading.  I'm
reluctant to try anything new unless I've first read an instruction
book on it.  I don't trust myself to learn via hands-on experience, so
I always look for books first.  And sometimes I never get past the
book-reading stage.

So, the lack of literature on NMM is probably a good thing for me.  It
means I'll just have to play the game, watch closely, and learn what
works and what doesn't.

Chess has an abundance of literature; checkers has some; NMM has
little.  And that suits me just fine.

Aside:  I guess NMM Is also a good game for somebody who likes doing
things in threes, since it's a three-in-a-row game.  :)
