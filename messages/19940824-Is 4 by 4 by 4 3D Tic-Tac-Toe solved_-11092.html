Hello wizards,

does any of you know if the 3D 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe has been solved? The
board could look like this:
                                 -  -  -  -
                               -  -  -  - |
                             -  -  -  -   |
                           -  -  -  -     |
                           |     |        |
                           |     -  -  -  -
                           |   -  -  -  - |
                           | -  -  -  -   |
                           -  -  -  -     |
                           |     |        |
                           |     -  -  -  -
                           |   -  -  -  - |
                           | -  -  -  -   |
                           -  -  -  -     |
                           |     |        |
                           |     -  -  -  -
                           |   -  -  -  -  
                           | -  -  -  -    
                           -  -  -  -      

Two players play O and X, one after another until one fills four in a
line. Line can be any row, column, or diagonal, including 3D lines.
There are several versions of the game including the popular 3x3
board. I know that 3D 8x8x8 has been solved, but cannot find about
4x4x4. Any info about playing strategies for this game would be
appreciated. Please reply to my e-mail address directly.
