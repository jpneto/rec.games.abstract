This seems like maybe an over-strong criterion by which to judge this
effort, if only because I can't imagine any circumstance under which
Go players would ever deem any game better than Go, even if you
created a game that was in some sense actually superior.  Experienced,
dedicated players are both emotionally wedded to their game and can
"see" into it more deeply than they can other games, so they'll always
think it best. The effect is really obvious among chess players since
a few profoundly good variants actually exist, but most chess players
would never admit that they rival FIDE chess for quality.

About whether the life-making rule is natural: because it's so
straightforward, it seems like a rule that has a chance of feeling
natural with a little experience.  Abstract games-makers often don't
like rules that "wear their intent on their sleeves", but I think that
this kind of obviousness can sometimes be a good thing.  Don't know
whether it is in the this case, but it could be.
