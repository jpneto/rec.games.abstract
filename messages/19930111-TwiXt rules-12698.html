First, did this group die over Christmas?  I haven't received any
posts here since I left for home in December.

Anyway, I tried to play a game of TwIxT at home based on what I remembered
of the rules, and I'd like a clarification.

		  

		   	  o
              /
		       /
            / 
		  x\  o x\
          \     \ 
		     \x o  \x
              /
		       / 
            /
		      o


In one of the earlier postings, it was declared that neither side could
break through the middle, and so this was an impasse, unless you allow
the rule that you can remove bridges.  However, what rule prevents x from
playing like this?:


		   	  o
              /
		       /x
            / /
		  x\  o/x\
          \ /   \ 
		     \x o  \x
              /
		       / 
            /
		      o

It's possible I got the situation wrong, but I'd like clear rules on where
tiles and bridges can be placed.

I'd also like to know how to capitalize TWixT, and why the heck tWIxT is
not capitalized like other games.

Please both post and e-mail your responses.
