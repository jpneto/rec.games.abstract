I'd like to chime in here. First off Nihius I am Corey Clark the
inventor of Slither. I'll say that Slither and Crossway are two very
different gameplay experiences. Slither has movement and almost cold
positions where you can lose tempo while Crossway is truer to its
predecessor, Hex. I doubt that Crossway is as thoroughly unplayable as
you say, especially when you take in to account the complete garbage
being designed today. I'd only played Crossway once as the second
player against a somewhat experienced player, Daniel Schultz and won,
so I think the game is playable at some level at least. This kind of
reminds me of Bill Taylor's recent "expose" on my other game Ki where
he described how you could make these 2x2 blocks that were
invulnerable to capture, what he failed to account for is that
creating this blocks is not an effective strategy because it doesn't
generate global influence over the board. Ki was playtested
extensively because it was almost unbelievable that it could play well
with no coldness and such simple rules but a few Go enthusiasts on
iggc demonstrated that it had quite a bit of depth for what it was. I
think Mark probably would've had the professional rigor to playtest
crossway and I don't think its fair to claim he didn't. The thing
about Crossway and Ki is you can't really blame designers for
releasing games like these even if they turned out to not be
tournament material because of their simplicity.

Perhaps you should try your hand at some Scrabble variations? There
your talents would really shine. As for your abstract games designs I
regret to say that the emperor's clothes are missing and there is
little hope for improvement.

Mark Steere invented Hex Oust, that alone is enough to commit him to
the abstract game design hall of fame. In all honesty, I'd have to
agree that there are a few unexceptional games in his resume but
that's to be expected in any designer who has a resume featuring so
many games. Mark has also made some very acclaimed abstracts like
Cephalopod. But here's something else, without Mark Steere's designs
and in particular Hex Oust I probably wouldn't have developed an
appreciation for finite and draw free games and the advent of Slither
may have never been! I don't think you can write off his whole resume,
featuring 20 some odd games because one of them didn't meet your
standards. And I highly recommend you play Hex Oust and try to tell me
that it's a bad game.
