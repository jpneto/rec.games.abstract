I don't agree with you, Torben.

There are four main reasons why the possibility of draws doesn't
necessarily make a fairer game than the absence of them:

1.- Assuming the game in question is not trivial, we don't know
whether perfect play would result in a draw, and the less frequent
draws are, the less probable it is.

2.- Even if draws are rare enough, that doesn't ensure that a drawn
game is a perfect game.

3.- It may occur that a game is not balanced for both sides while
still being a draw if played perfectly.

4.- If we could play that perfect game, its result wouldn't matter
anymore, because the game would then lose much of its interest.

In short: it is not the presence or absence of draws what makes a game
more or less fairer, but the fact that both sides have equal winning
chances. Chess is a good example of an unfair game that allows (and to
what extent!) draws.

And theres is yet another problem with draws: even if they are
uncommon, there is always the annoying possibility that they become
more and more frequent as the players skill grows. Draughts is a good
example: two amateurs can play it and draw just one in ten games, but
two proffessional players will draw 90% of the time. I therefore think
that the impossibility of draws is a good guarantee that the game will
pass the test of expert play.
