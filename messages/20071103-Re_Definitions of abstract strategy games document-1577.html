Not every Chess variant has to be an abstract game.  Chess variance
and abstractness are two different, independent properties of a game.

The fact the Board Game Geek lists Backgammon as a strategy game means
that whoever created the entry for Backgammon checked off the
"Abstract Strategy" box, nothing more.  It's not like some committee
voted on it.

And Chebache, and others?  This is what the abstractstrategy site has
as a game on its list.

Typing "backgammon abstract strategy" into google primarily results in
links to the discussion here.  Not good.  The first real reference to
Backgammon specifically describes both Backgammon <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Kriegspiel as

"Abstract strategy games furthermore minimize the element of chance.
It is essential to their definition that such games have perfect
information: each player, when deciding his move, must have complete
information about the current position of the board (I include in
"position" qualities that may be physically undetectable, such as
whether a player may castle), or equivalently, about the original
position of the board and all moves made so far. Examples of perfect
information games would include Chess and Backgammon; games like
Stratego, Kriegspiel, or the recent Stealth Chess are not perfect
information games. Also, there must be no chance elements introduced
by such mechanisms as dice, cards, or dominos drawn at random:
Backgammon is not an abstract strategy game."

That is the Game Journal entry, which argues the combinatorial game
theory approach to abstract strategy games.

This definition would exclude Chess variants that have random elements
or hidden information.

Here's the link to Mark Thomson's well known, authoritative treatise
on abstract games:

It is worth noting, but it isn't gospel, and isn't the law either.

I unhesitatingly defer to Mark's definition and so should you, Rich.
Yes, some people will complain.  Some people will always complain.
Are you going to try to accommodate every complaint you ever get?

When you are trying to build an association to represent all
abstracts, the idea is to have a sufficiently large user base to make
it sustainable.  This is why it is important.
