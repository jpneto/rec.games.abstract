Go has basically three rules:

1) Players take turns placing stones at unoccupied intersections.
2) Any orthogonally-connected group of stones of a single color 
   which lose their last unoccupied orthogonally adjacent space
   are removed from the board and set aside.
3) It is forbidden to make a move which results in a full-board
   layout which has already appeared.

The object is to surround territory, and the score is the amount
of territory surrounded less the number of stones lost (see rule 
#2) during the game.

Now, what I've given you is a highly trivialized explanation of
go as played with Japanese scoring and the superko rule.  This
tells you almost nothing, of course, because all of the 
intricacy in go lies in the strategy and tactics; the rules are 
almost trivial.

You would do best to go over to "rec.games.go" and read the FAQ
list; that will probably tell you more than you want to know.
