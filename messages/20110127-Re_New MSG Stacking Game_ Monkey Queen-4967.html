If you ask me what an abstract game is or what a combinatorial game is, my
definitions will be as strict as anyone's.  But to me a stacking game is
just a game where it's convenient to play it by stacking and unstacking
things.  It doesn't have to meet some arbitrary definition where the role of
stacking is somehow more integral to the game.

A player has a queen and X number of babies in a reserve.

Yes, and it's really convenient to do this with a stack of checkers.  Very
ergonomic.  It passes the one hand test.  I.e. you can play the game with
one hand.

Why?  It's a more complex manipulation.  Go stones weren't intended to be
slid.  They aren't as big and don't mark a big square as clearly.

Btw the "birthing" mechanism of Monkey Queen can certainly be used in other
games as a way to introduce pieces into play, just as the merging mechanism
of Mad Bishops can be used.  The Mad Bishops mechanism is interesting but
not my greatest ever, and I encourage other designers to use it.

Something like the Monkey Queen mechanism though is closer to my heart. 
Subtle mechanisms for fluid, seemingly infinite games which are actually
finite are hard to come up with.  I really do hate variants which
appropriate my more interesting mechanisms.

I know there's no ill intent on the part of my fellow designers, but it's
like someone created a clone of my infant for the express purpose of hacking
off its arms, legs and head with a machete.  I repeat something that I've
called upon designers to do many, many times in the past.  Please use
something other than an MSG game as the basis for your game (unless it's the
Mad Bishops mechanism or something that you've cleared with me first).

If the center is important, and having a lead in babies is important,
why not try to  balance the game by making the first player's first
move not make a baby?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The pie rule is the most innocuous rule for balancing.  I don't want to
create an endlessly tweaked, balancing kludgefest.  That being said,
something a little kludgier than the pie rule may turn out to be necessary,
such as one player makes the first two moves and the other chooses which
color to play.  I don't think that'll be necessary for Monkey Queen, but
that would be a next step if one was needed.
