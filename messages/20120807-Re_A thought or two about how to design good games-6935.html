Yeah, it should come as no surprise that many of my ideas originate in the Thompson essay. Though at this stage of my understanding, I feel the Thompson essay is fuzzy in places (w/r/t clarity, for example. The irony!), and leaves out important things.

Again I agree, sorry for not being argumetative ;-) To add to the irony, our 'false clarity' concept has great clarity and can be detected in any great game (not 'easily' though, the point being that you have to pursue a game's strategies and tactical means to sme considerable degree). That's one Mark failed to mention indeed. Moreover, his examples are a bit ... outdated maybe, and like me he doesn't make a great point of finitude or drawlessness. However, by and large most would feel you both present excellent criteria. 

But thinking about inventing games is not inventing games. Inventing games may be a bit like Tal, who never thought about how to play Chess because he was too busy playing Chess.
