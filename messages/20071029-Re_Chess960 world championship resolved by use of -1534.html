Ok, in the ongoing idea suggesting new ideas for multiple reasons, I
am wondering about this one.  I read in Games Magazine that the
Chess960 world championship was decided with a final game of Blitz
Chess960.

On that note, I am curious what people's thoughts would be if you were
to have regular chess have a final tiebreaker game be a blitz chess
match, rather than the world champion retain the title.

Any comments?

Its not a new idea, been used in various forms.

My personal view: it's like deciding the results of a 10K dead heat by
having the contestants run a 100 m dash. You don't really change the
result: the 10K was still a dead heat, all you know is who can run the
fastest 100 m amongst 2 tired long distance runners.

Of course this kind of idea is found in sports like American football,
with sudden death overtime, forced 2 point conversions, more crap to
make the game "televisable" or understood by talking monkeys is all
the vogue.

Does anyone care about chess on the highest level?  Does it do
anything to promote the game of chess in any manner?  If not, they why
keep it the way it is, because people are to set in their ways to have
it any other way?
