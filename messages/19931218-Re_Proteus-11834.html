My first game of Proteus went on for a long time, but my second game only
lasted about 20 minutes.  As you learn the ropes, it becomes easier to play
and plan out strategies.  The biggest problem with Proteus, though, is that
the middle space on the board is FAR more important than any other, because
of the three-in-a-row win condition.  An opponent quickly discovered the
tactic of setting up a diagonal line of his pieces and never moving out of
the center square.  If he ever managed to get the three-in-a-row condition
active, he was a maximum of one move away from winning.  At the same time,
while his pieces are arranged diagonally, it's impossible for me to win with
that condition.

I do like the game, though, and the deluxe set is very nice.  All of Kadon
Enterprise's games are of top-notch quality.
