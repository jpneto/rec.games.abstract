I like the extended pie rule, since it can compensate for a difficult
pattern.  One question, though: Can the first player become Black by
passing immediately, or must one black stone be played?

In any case, the target pattern must be sufficiently difficult that you
can't win by passing as early as possible and then easily build the
target pattern.  But nor should it be so difficult that phase 1 takes
most of the game.  I can't offhand say if a coil has the right balance,
but it sounds plausible.

You can become black by passing immediately.  But it would be suicide
because it is very easy to block a loop.  My experience so far is that
players will place at least 4 stones each in the contract phase on a
hexhex7 board.

The reason that I was exploring this part of design space is that
simple loops on hex tilings are difficult to form, so there are few
hex games with simple loop win conditions.

To be sure, there are a number of games involving loops on hex
tilings, but the loops are generally complicated by some mechanism to
make them easier.  There are wraparound loops on projective boards
(Projex, Loophole), Loops as only one of several win conditions
(Havannah), loops in 3 dimensional stacks of pieces (Lazo), etc.  My
goal here was to keep the win condition as simple and as visually
intuitive as possible, and then to mess with some other aspect of the
rules in order to make the game fair. Hence the the extended pie
rule.

As an aside, I love this particular extended pie rule (there are
several possible), not just because it is a very general way of
balancing game.  The <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>real<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> reason I love it is that it lends texture
to gameplay.  The phased nature of games that use it make the
experience of playing varied, and perhaps more important, it makes the
beginning of the game less intimidating to new players.  The contract
phase feels a bit more like cooperation and a bit less like
competition, and players have a short term goal to shoot for at the
outset, when new players are most likely to feel lost in these sorts
of games. I have an important test for the games I design: the
girlfriend test.  My girlfriend, who's a keen games player in general,
nonetheless dislikes the geometric games that I design, because they
intimidate her.  I've found that by adding this extended pie rule to
certain games I can make them more attractive to her.  That is
certainly the case with Coil.  Of the last 20 or 30 games I've tried
out on her, she seems to like Coil the most.
