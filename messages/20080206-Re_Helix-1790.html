Helix rules:

Start with an initially empty hexagonally tessellated surface of a
torus.

Winning conditions for Black: Form a right handed helical loop or any
closed loop surrounding the circular axis of the torus except for a
left handed helical loop.

Winning conditions for White: Form a left handed helical loop or any
closed loop surrounding the linear axis of the torus except for a
right handed helical loop.

This won't work, as you can fill the surface without having a winner.

Let white pieces fill a right-handed helical loop and a loop
surrounding the circular "axis" of the torus (note that the two loops
cross/overlap in a single hex), and let black pieces fill the rest.

White doesn't fulfil his winning conditions, as he has no left-handed
helical loop nor a non-helical loop around the linear axis.

But black doesn't either.  He can not have a loop around the circular
"axis" of the torus, as that would be broken by the white helical
loop.  Nor can he have a right-handed helical loop, as that would be
broken by the white loop around the circular "axis".

So I'm afraid your attempt at fixing my flawed "Torex" game has
failed.  Where Torex doesn't have exclusive wins on a filled board,
your variant doesn't guarantee that there will be a winner.  In some
sense, that is worse, as Torex will have a unique winner during normal
play -- as one of the two players will be the first to establish his
or her winning conditions.
