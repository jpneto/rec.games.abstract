Not true.  In king &amp; pawn endgames, the primary object is to penetrate to the  
opponent's side of the board with the king, in order to pick off the pawns, which  
almost always are blocked by their counterparts.  The only effect of this  
modification would be to increase the value of the opposition unduly.
