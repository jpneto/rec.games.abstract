a Five-in-a-row game:

I translate the rules into English:

1. Ergo is played on a board which consists of 9x10 squares.
2. Each player has 12 cylindrical pieces (white or black). One side has a
   lion, the other side is hollow.
3. White starts the game.
4. A player may either place a stone unto an unoccupied square or move one
   of his pieces which is already on the board.
5. If a piece is placed unto one of the 34 edge squares, it must a lion
   piece (lion facing up).
6. If a player puts a piece on one of the other squares, the hollow side
   must be up. The center of the board (56 squares) is called the "arena".
7. The hollow pieces may move one empty square orthogonally.
8. If a hollow piece is moved to the edge it is promoted to a lion stone.
9. Lions move one square in every direction, like a king in Chess, if they
   are not at the edge or if they move from the edge to the center. Lions
   may also move along the edge as far as they want, even around corners, but
   they may not jump over other pieces.
10. There is no capturing.
11. The player who has an unbroken, diagonal or orthogonal row of 5 (or
    more) pieces of his color wins. The pieces may be located at the edge
    and consist of both types of stones.
12. Repetition of the full board position three times results in a drawn
    game.


The game is very deep and combimes elements reminiscent of Renju and
Morris.
The German review includes many wrong statements which prove that the
reviewer did not understand the strategy behind the game.

Some hints ("Ergo proverbs"):

Try to force your opponent to place more pieces than you. The pieces in
your hand are strongest. The player who is able to place the last
piece has an advantage.

If you block a row of three, do it at the edge (if possible) to get a
lion.

Lions are strongest at the edge.

A broken three (similar to Renju) should always be blocked by putting a
piece in the gap.

Balance attack and defense in the opening or you will lose early in the
middle game.

The game is more strategical than you think. Build strong positions, such
as Fours, and you will win, even if you don't see how.

Control the center and attack from the edge!



Ralf
