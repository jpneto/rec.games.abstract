That only leaves monumental hypocrite, Christian Freeling, who only grudgingly gives credit after someone has thoroughly restructured his game (e.g. Arty/Hanniball).

I offered Arty co-ownership because he deserved it - he never asked for it. Same with David Bush and YvY. I offered Benedikt Rosenau co-ownership, not because he co-invented it, but because without him neither Symple and Sygo (not to mention Charybdis) would not heve existed. There's nothing grudgingly about it.

Lately Mark invents "as a purely mental process". Redstone is given as an example. The only thing "purely mental", barring Mark himself, was the idea of using neutral stones in a Go concept. It worked out, but hardly as a purely mental process. It's all here at rga, anybody can check.

Lately, too, Mark is insinuating that I am using fake identities. I'm not. I must be on his mind for some reason.
