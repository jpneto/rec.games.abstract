Thank-you and thank-you!   But alas, my corrections need a correction!  (Ugh)
I said the T-pentomino was a 4, but no, it is a 5.  Silly me.

Now that all polyominos up to the pentominos have been assigned a

Yes I did alll these.  In fact, I did them twice on different days just
to make sure there were no mistakes, but haven't got the results with me
to check!   Bummer!!

and at the next level we have 108 heptominos. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Eggshelly, we have to count 109 for this purpose.  (There is a constant
befufflement over whether there are 108 or 109 heptominos, due to the
existence of one with a "hole".  For this game, it is a genuine one.)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Therefore, rather than calculating the Grundy values for the more
complicated polynominos, one might focus on the polynominos that have
a Grundy value of 0 (i.e. the 'cold' polynominos).

Fair enough point.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Only even polynominos can have zero Grundy value.

I can't see why!   I'm sure that's false, in fact.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Yet, upon investigating the hexominos I found 8 'cold' configurations:

X   X    X    X   XX   XXX  XXX  XXX  
XX  XX  XXX   XX  XXX  XX   XX    X   
XX  XX  X    XX    X   X     X   XX   
X    X  X    X    
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

    The first one is NOT a zero, because it can be reduced to a zero...
X
- X
X X      &lt;--- 1 + 1 = 0.    (You had a blind spot with the S-tetromino before!
X                          Your number 7 has the same property.

Indeed, though there is no zero pentomino, I'm sure that little pseudo-pent
would make a good counter-example to whatever heuristic argument you had
that an odd-omino can't be zero.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Assuming this very rapid growth of the number of 'cold' configurations
to continue, numerous octominos can be expected to have zero Grundy value.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No doubt.  But I expect there are zero heptominos too.  I'm sure someone
here could write a program for this, (Joao?), and produce some numbers
for us.  It would make a good integer sequence for the handbook!

Much more puzzling to analyse is the "misere" version, where the last move
loses.  For Nim itself this is easy, but for these more complex variants
it can be a real bastard! 
I don't think even CGB in WW got a complete theory for it.

-----------------

BTW, if you like my nomenclature:-  Someone (not me) suggested that 
the poly-triangles should be called "polyiamonds", so that the 2-triangle
becomes the "diamond".  Not bad eh?

In similar vein, my suggestion is that the poly-hexes should be called
"polyhives", as they look like beehives.  Then the 2-hexagon can be called
a "bi-hive", pronounced "bee-hive", of course!!!    ;-)
