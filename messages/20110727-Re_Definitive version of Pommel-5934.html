Yes, no long slide after the last captured piece.

Not being able to construct a drawn position goes a long way towards a
proof.
The game is about the same as the square version you sent me, but I
like this better. I don't think Benedikt will object to its inclusion
in the 'Evolution' because its such an eelegant way to implement
linear capture, only singlestroke, very Bushka like. Moreover, the
Steerish way to prevent draws is new. Like demoted kings its a rule
with an obvious intent, but it is in fact more generic, simpler and
more effective.

Thanks.  I was able to construct drawn positions on other boards,
specifically a board that contains a triangle where the vertices of
the triangle are at the board's edge -- in this case three two
promoted pieces can cycle from vertex to vertex indefinitely.  I don't
think it's possible on the boards I have specified and I don't think
there are other drawing positions, but I can't guarantee it.  Now I
just need to get some people to play it.  I can only learn so much by
watching Zillions play itself, although Zillions appears to play it
very well.
