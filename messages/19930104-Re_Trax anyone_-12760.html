Well, due to popular demand :-)

Here, without permission, are the rules to Trax, (as I remember them
in any case):

1. Two players, red and white.
2. Each plays in turn, placing one tile per turn.
   a. Every tile in the game is identical. On one face a tile has the
   following pattern:
                            +--------+ 	 Where the double lines are one
                            |   ||   | 	 colour, and the single lines
                            |   //   |	 another.
                            | ==   --|
                            |     /  |
                            |     |  |
			    +--------+
       On the other side, a tile has this pattern:
       	       	       	    +--------+
			    |   ||   |
			    |	||   |
			    |---||---|
			    |	||   |
			    |	||   |
			    +--------+

   b. When placing a tile, a player must place it so as to ensure that
   it connects up with at least one previously placed tile. (This
   connection must keep coloured lines appropriate linked).

   3. As a result of placing a tile, it is possible that a player has
   created a situation that can not just be left as it is. The
   situation is if an empty space is touched by two incoming lines of
   the same colour. 

   For example:
             +--------
	     |   ||   
	     |   //   
	     | ==   --
	     |     /  
	     |     |  
	     +--------
