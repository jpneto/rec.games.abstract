Yes, but you don't tell your opponent the strategies...

I was aware of that, but it's a classic case of "he thinks that I

There's more strategy in my game than in Scissors, Stone, and Paper.
For one thing, it is good for you, I would think, to have a selection
of columns, if you are player 1 (rows if you are player 2), that are
tied for their large number of x's and a selection of columns (or
rows) that are tied for their low number of x's. That way, if it is
your turn to win if possible, you might play one of the columns with
lots of x's, but which column is not known to your opponent. And if it
is your opponent's turn to possibly win, it is good to play one of the
columns with a smaller number of x's. Or am I wrong about this?

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
