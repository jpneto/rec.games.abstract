I enjoy abstract board (or table, or whatever the term I should use is?)
games, and often play them with friends either in real life, or over e-mail.

However I there are also good abstract games which perhaps would not work
without a computer (tetris is of course by far the most obvious example).

I was wondering if there are any sites or groups which discuss abstract
computer games? (or should I talk about them right here? ^_^ )

Tetris could work without a computer.  Draw a piece at random from a bag,
place it on the board, following the rules of placement that the computer
version would allow.  About the only aspects I can think of that would be
difficult are (a) removing a filled-in line, and (b) enforcing the speed
limitations (e.g. when you have a move that would be legal, but can't make
it in the computer game because you can't move the piece fast enough to
avoid other obstacles).

Somewhere on the web there are some research math articles about tetris as
an abstract game.  Seems like University of Alberta had one.

P.S.  There was in fact a tetris board game produced, though it wasn't
really the same as the game you're thinking of.  I have a copy of it
somewhere.
