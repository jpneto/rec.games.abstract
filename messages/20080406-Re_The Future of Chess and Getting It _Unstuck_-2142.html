<br>Interesting that you touch on this problem, because bent four in the
<br>corner is only a problem in Japanese scoring (and maybe Korean?). It
<br>is already cleared up in many rulesets, Area scoring rulesets never
<br>had it as I understand.
<br></blockquote>
<br>As a Go player, I am struck by your words "problem", and "cleared up". I 
see bent four as no more of a "problem" than the en passant rule. Here 
is a brief history of bent four.
<br>
<br>In Chinese rules, a "bent four" group dies if the opponent can kill it, 
and not if he can't.&nbsp; Weak amateur Chinese players often believe that it 
can always be killed;&nbsp; they are mistaken, it takes a little skill to 
kill it, and in certain rare circumstances it cannot be killed.
<br>
<br>In Japanese rules, it used to be that there was a rule specifically 
saying that a bent four rule was always dead.&nbsp; Occasionally, someone 
would find an obscure position having similar properties to "bent four", 
and bring it to the attention of the authorities;&nbsp; who would consider 
it, and eventually make a special ruling on it.&nbsp; Japanese players seemed 
happy enough with this state of affairs, but western players (who 
generally used Japanese rules) did not like a rule book that included a 
lengthening list of special cases.&nbsp; In 1982 the Japanese authorities 
produced a new rule book, which instead included an algorithm for 
establishing whether such special positions were alive or dead.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>American checkers players accepted a radical change to their game, but
<br>the Japanese Go players apparently don't feel their game is broken
<br>enough to warrant it. That's their call to make.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Japanese Go players didn't feel their game was broken.&nbsp; They did change 
their rule book, in a way that did not affect the game but did happen to 
bring the rule book itself more in line with western tastes.
