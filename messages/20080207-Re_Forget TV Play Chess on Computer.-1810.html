<br><blockquote type=cite>But analyzing

<br>But can be done. I used to watch a bit when we had it - my father was 
the
<br>real chess player in the family, and he'd be watching it. I remember a
<br>K vs. K game (carefully avoiding having to remember which Ks) which got
<br>to a point which to me looked like both had developed, white rather 
better.
<br>But the commentator(s) - British grandmasters were cheap - pointed out
<br>that black had no moves. Basically his only play was moving a knight 
back
<br>and forward. And even I knew that at that point black was doomed. White
<br>could manoeuvre however he likes - maintaining the stranglehold - and 
then
<br>launch a killing attack. Of course white could still blow it - but when 
white
<br>was one of the Ks (probably Kasparov, but maybe not) that wasn't going
<br>to happen. But it was the commentator who explained what was actually
<br>happening.
<br>
<br>The other approach they tried was playing the game, then getting each
<br>player to give a running commentary on how he (claimed) he was thinking
<br>&nbsp;- done as if recorded during the game, but of course recorded 
afterwards.
<br>Splice together with a playing of the game spread over a suitable length
<br>of time, and quite effective.
<br>
<br>So it can be done - if you have the opportunity.
