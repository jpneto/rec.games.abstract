Why not?  :)  I gave Particle Bond an "interesting", a rare gift from me,
even after you relentlessly assaulted me and my games.  I have an apparently
rare gift for appreciating a design independent of who designed it,
something I developed after five years of having my designs totally ignored
here in rec.games.abstract because I wasn't deemed worthy.

I think you're not done tweaking Radiolarians and you never will be.

Radiolarians is done. I tweaked it maybe once and I'm quite fine with
the current ruleset. Why am I not releasing it? Who knows. Laziness is
one factor, definitely. I didn't really want to design it either. It's
like what happened with Christian Freeling, he wanted to quit
designing games altogether and he came up with one while nodding off
to sleep. Radiolarians wasn't the design I wanted to make, it just
happened on the L-train.
