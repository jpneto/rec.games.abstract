Hello:

	I was recently introduced to a simple game called Hex, to wit:

	- The board is composed of thirteen rows of thirteen hexagons,
	  forming a parallelogram.

Any NxN will do.  13x13 is pretty big.  7x7 is already non-trivial.
9x9 fits nicely on an 8-1/2 x 11 sheet of paper, with hexagons
big enough to accomodate go stones.

	- There are two players, 'X' and 'O.'  Each player 'owns' two
	  opposite edges of the parallelogram.

	- The two players take turns placing their marks in the hexes.  
	  The only 'special' thing here is that the first player may not 
	  mark the center hex (i.e. the seventh hex in the seventh row)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Never heard this restriction.  There are various ways to make the game
more balanced in view of the first player's large advantage.  The most
elegant, to my thinking, is to have one player put some stones of either
or both colors on the board and say whether it's White's turn or Black's
turn to play, and then the other player choose which color to play.

	- The first player to form a connected line of hexes, no matter
	  how squiggly, from one of his edges to the other, wins the 
	  game.

	That is all there is.  I am interested in teaching my computer
to play this game.  I was wondering what sort of thoughts people had on
algorithms/strategies for this game.  I have not been able to play very 
effectively yet, but I am working on it 8^).

As it happens, I am working on a program to play Hex as part of my
dissertation work.  It seems to be very difficult to make a computer
play Hex well.  The standard methods used for chess programs are pretty
feeble for Hex, compared to the reasoning power of us human players.

Does anybody know about any other Hex programs, or articles about
Hex algorithms?  If so, please mail me about them.

No, I don't have a good Hex program that you all can play with.  Maybe
in a few months.
