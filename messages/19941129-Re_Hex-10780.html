 &gt;&gt; Can you offer a single reason why the discovery of an admissible function

 &gt;Duh.

Duh?  Oh, that's intelligent.  Does your mother know how rude you are?

 &gt; Maybe because many people have tried and haven't been able to make
 &gt;the slightest bit of progress?

Many people have tried?  What people?  Do you have any references to
back up that statement?  I would be very interested in reading more
about any research that has been done on this topic.

I suspect what you mean to say is that it is a hard problem because
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> couldn't immediately think of anything.  Well, it's certainly
hard to argue with that kind of logic.

 &gt; How do we know that any problem is hard, except in that way?

Not all hard problems are equal.  Some hard problems can be solved.
Experience can give us insight into which problems might be solvable,
and which one's are beyond our reach.  For example, experience teaches
us that monotonic problems are generally much easier than non-monotonic
problems.

There are many ways of measuring the difficultly or intractability of
a given problem, and human effort is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> one of the better metrics.
If you're having trouble with this concept, see a mathematician, or a
theoretical computer scientist, or Vanna White; perhaps you can buy a clue.

 &gt;Unless you have something new to add, I don't have anything more to say.

I do have at least one thing to add, but not in polite company...
