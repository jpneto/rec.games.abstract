<br>You simply haven't considered the difficulties in implementing the
<br>cheating scheme that Mr. Richerby proposes in chess.
<br>
<br>Imagine that I have an agreement with Mr. Richerby (both of us
<br>being dishonorable people) so that whenever we reach a
<br>drawn position, we agree to flip a coin and the loser throws
<br>the game.
<br>
<br>We reach such a position, implement our plan, and I lose the toss.
<br>Both of us are near the top of the tournament, so it is going to cost
<br>me prize money today when I lose on purpose. Sure, he will gain
<br>a lot more than I lose, but that does me no good today. I don't
<br>know the next time I will play him. It could be years from now.
<br>I don't know that the next time I play him whether there will be
<br>any money on the line. I don't know that the next time I play
<br>him that I will win the toss. I don't know that the next time I play
<br>him and win the toss with money on the line, that he will keep
<br>his side of the deal and throw the game to me. No honor
<br>among thieves, right? And of course, I will have to make
<br>some really bad moves to lose. I'll lose rating points. If my bad
<br>moves are too obvious, I might get caught.
<br>
<br>Still sound like a reasonable cheating scheme?
<br>
<br>What would more likely happen is a collusion of a different sort. I will
<br>play aggressively with White to get an advantage. Suppose that he
<br>sees a way to simplify into a drawish position where I have a slight
<br>advantage but he can probably hold the draw. That "draw at best"
<br>line doesn't look so good if draws don't count as much. So he uses
<br>his chess skill to come up with a different plan, based on counterplay
<br>elsewhere on the board, etc.
<br>
<br>In short, we collude to play chess.
<br>
<br>

<br><blockquote type=cite>The point is that the current scoring system produces collusion
<br>in chess that nobody disputes. It <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> part of chess' tradition to
<br>have unplayed draws. While I might grant that people should be on the
<br>look out for these far-fetched theoretical possibilities that Mr.
<br>Richerby raises, they should not be considered as serious
<br>objections absent <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> supporting evidence.
<br></blockquote>
<br>As far as I can make out, this says "because chess players collude today
<br>when the scoring system means it is to their mutual advantage, it is
<br>ridiculous to suggest they would do so when a different scoring system had
<br>such a consequence".
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's saying that if you want to reduce dishonest collusion in chess, you
<br>should reduce the value of draws. Of course, the main advantage to
<br>reducing the value of draws is that the game will become more interesting
<br>to play and watch!
