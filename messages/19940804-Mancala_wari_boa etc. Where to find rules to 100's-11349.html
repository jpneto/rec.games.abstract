Several people have posted asking about MANCALA games.


There are three good books with information on a variety
Mancala games. The first two are 'Board and Table Games from
Many Civilizations", books 1 and 2,  by R. C. Bell. Each book
has a chapter on Mancala games. In addition to the rules,
Mr. Bell includes some history and in some cases, some strategy hints.

Dover published a revised edition that combines both in a single
volume. It is most likely still in print and easily available. It is
one of my favorite books about games. R. C. Bell has published many
other books on games and games history.


However, the one and only, best book about mancala is 'Mancala Games',
by Laurence Russ, published in 1984 by Reference Publications, Inc. 
(218 St. Clair River Drive, Box 344, Algonac, Michigan   48001 USA)
I have no idea if it is still in print. It is 110 pages of nothing but
rules to hundreds of versions of mancala. That's right <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>hundreds<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of
versions of the game! It is divided into three sections, Two row games,
Three row games and Four row games. Those sections are further divided
into 10 chapters - Wari, single lap games, multiple lap games, capturing
by fours - they're are all in there. There is very little historical
information and no strategy hints.
