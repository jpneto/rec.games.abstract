While waking up this morning these rules came to me. I am curious if
this game exists or not. It needs a name. As of now, it is called "The
Single Line Game" (the name should be changed. I recall there is
supposed to be a 1D Go type game. Maybe this is like it.

Anyhow, the rules (They need to be in Courier font to get board layout
correct):

[Single Line game]

Set up (X and O represent two different sides of pieces.  Board can be
larger or smaller in size):
X X X X X X X X X X
: : : : : : : : : :
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
: : : : : : : : : :
O O O O O O O O O O

Object:
Occupy the most spaces at end of game. Keep playing until one player
no longer has a legal move.  Then count up who has most pieces in the
middle (the + area).  Player with most spaces in middle of board
occupied with their pieces wins the game.


Play:
1. Slide one of your own pieces into the middle of the board to an
unoccupied space if you can (the + represents this in diagram above).


2. Capture rules:
A. Bookend capture. If a piece slides and bookends a line of pieces of
an opponent, all the opponent's pieces are removed:
O-X-X-X-O
^
: Piece slides in here, resulting in:

O-+-+-+-O

In bookend capture, the board is considered to wrap around.  If a
player can bookend a group of pieces that wraps around the board, then
it can capture.  Example:

O-O-O-O-+-+-+-+-X-O
        ^
        : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces, resulting
in:
+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-X-+

Same with this:
O-O-O-O-+-+-+-+-+-X
        ^
        : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces, resulting
in:
+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-+-X

If positions were reverses with which X piece slid in, it still would
be the same:
O-O-O-O-X-+-+-+-+-O
                ^
                : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces,
resulting in:
+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-X-+

AND

O-O-O-O-X-+-+-+-+-+
                  ^
                  : X piece put here could capture all the O pieces,
resulting in:
+-+-+-+-X-+-+-+-+-X



B. Majority capture. If a piece slides in and creates a group larger
than an opponent's group of pieces, the pieces of opponent are
removed:
O-O-O-X-X
^
: Piece slides in here, resulting in:

O-O-O-+-+

In majority capture, the board is not considered to wrap around, like
with bookend capture.

A piece is not legally permitted to slide in between two opponent's
pieces if it would result in it being bookend captured, unless the
slide results in a capture of an opponent's piece:
Not legal to enter: O-+-O
Legal to enter: O-+-O-X- (Entry looks like: O-X-O-X, resulting in: O-X-
+-X)
Legal to Enter: O-+-X-O- (Entry looks like: O-X-X-O, resulting in: -+-
X-X-+-)


Variant rule:
Rather than capture, flip pieces to own side, like in Reversi/Othello.
