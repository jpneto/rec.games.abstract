First, the typical meaning of abstract games refers to games with no
random elements and no hidden information.
This definition underlines this post. Another definition will empty
this discussion.

I find it difficult to see how Batik could be considered an abstract
game. The game only makes sense because it's based on the dynamics of
a physical system that is not known entirely by either player. That's
why a player is not sure what happens next when he places a piece.

Hidden information does not mean only that players know the same
information. It means that they know <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> relevant information. In a
game like Batik the amount of relevant information cannot be entirely
known (there are issues of friction, gravity, etc. which are critical
to the game outcome). A computer simulation does not solve this
problem. If the simulation is too complex, we have basically the same
problem (even if both players know the algorithm, they are unable to
follow the computation). If it is too simple, it would not be a proper
approximation of the game it tries to simulate (imagine a Backgammon
software where the dice does not follow an uniform distribution). So,
Batik has hidden information, therefore it is not an abstract game.

If you accept Batik as an abstract game by enlarging the concept of
abstract games, then you would need to include games like Pick Up
Sticks [<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6424/pick-up-sticks">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6424/pick-up-sticks</a>].
This would make the concept too generic and not very useful.
