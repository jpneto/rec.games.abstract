Introduction:
This is Simultaneous Connect Four.  It is simultaneous, because both
players select their moves simultanously, then resolve.

The origins of this game came out of a project to develop a way to
play abstract strategy games with large numbers of people playing in a
crowd.  Connect 4 was selected as the base game to get the massive
multiplayer framework to work.  The end result is an interesting take
on Connect Four that turns what it seen as a simple children's game
into a game that is a bit of war of nerves with additional depth,
eventhough it stops being a pure abstract strategy game in the
process.

Equipment:
* Standard Connect Four Set.
* Two sets of cards (numbered 1-7), each number having one of these
numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  An 8 sided die may be used, with 8
being no option, or 6 sided.  Each player would have one.
* Two sets of stickers to mark each column 1-7.
* Initiative token.  This token is used for tie-breaking purposes in
the event both players select the same column.  An item that stands
out and is small enough to pass from player to player, can be used.

Preparation of Equipment for Play:
* Each side has stickers placed on it, either Each column is marked on
both sides with the same number on both sides for each column.  One
side has numbers go from left to right from 1 to 7 incrementally by 1,
while the other side goes from left to right 7 to 1, decrementally by
1.

Set Up:
1. Separate piles of cards 1-7 into two even piles.  Give each set of
cards to each player.  These cards are used to select moves.
2. Determine which player will start with the initiative token.  This
can be done randomly or by some other method.

Rules:
1. Players at the same time select which column they want to drop a
checker into.  This process is done simultaneously and is hidden.  If
using cards, one suggestion is to put the selection at the bottom of
the hand of cards players have.
2. Players then reveal which column they selected.
3. If the players selected different columns then players drop their
checkers into their own column, and go onto next turn.
4. If players both select the same column, then the player who has the
initiative token would place their checker first, and their opponent
would then place after them, and the initiative token is then passed
to the opponent, who then now has the initiative token.
5. If, when players simultaneously pick the same column, and the first
player places their checker in the last open space in a column, then
the second player forfeits the ability to place a checker during that
turn.  However, eventhough they forfeited the chance to place a
checker, they still gain control of the initiative token.

Winning the Game:
1. First player to get four in a row wins the game.  In the case that
both players win at the same time, the player with the initiative
token wins.

Variants:
1. As an intro game, use only columns 1-6.  Block off column 7.  This
gives people a good feel for the game before playing the full way.
This version is proposed so that players can get used to the game, and
also eliminate the middle column advantage found in the normal game.
This is how the game was originally intended to be played, but people
felt that the simultaneous element eliminated the first player
advantage that is gained by playing in column 4.  Also, you can play
this version using six sided dice as selectors.
2. Dice may be used instead of cards, if this is what players have
available. Six or 8 sided are recommended.  Players would conceal what
they select as their move, and the put the facing representing the
column they want to select, and then reveal.
3. In the case that both players win at same time, the player who
DOESN'T have the initiative token wins the game.  This is a flipping
of the normal conditions to resolve simultaneous wins.
