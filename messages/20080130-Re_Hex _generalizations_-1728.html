With those starting and ending arrangements in Mind Ninja you could
very easily fill the board with stones and not have any two opposite
segments connected, resulting in a draw.  Draws can't occur in Atoll.
Before you posit any more ridiculous conjectures about what Atoll is
"exactly equivalent to" you might want to actually look at the Atoll
rule sheet.

And you might want to look at Mind Ninja... it does not have draws.
Goals are expressed in terms of patterns the builder will try to
build, and the blocker will try to prevent from being built. If the
game ends and the pattern isn't built, the blocker has won.

It so happens that for the "Hex" pattern (and for the various n-Atoll
patterns, all of which are expressible within Mind Ninja constraints),
a failure of the builder to complete his goal means the blocker must
have completed the converse goal... but most patterns aren't symmetric
in that way. For instance, the ring, fork, bridge pattern that is in
Havannah can be used in Mind Ninja, but then those situations that
would be ties in regular Havannah become wins for the blocker (moving
second) in Mind Ninja.

It's just wrong that Atoll is the only possible generalisation of Hex.
Depending on what aspects of Hex one sees as crucial, there are surely
many other ways of generalizing it.
