This is a game for any plural number of players. It is suggested that
there be at least 3 players.

Each player has an identical deck of m notecards, each card in each
deck labeled with a different integer from 1 to m, where m is a
positive integer large enough to make the game interesting.

Players pair off during the game, where every possible one of n*(n-1)/
2 (n= number of players) pairings occurs, and all the pairing occur in
some predetermined order.

Each player has two piles of cards: Their "moldy" pile (which starts
out with zero cards in it), and their "fresh" pile (which starts out
with every one of their cards in it). The cards in their fresh pile
are all turned face-down, but can be looked at by the player who owns
the deck.

On a move, the two paired-off players each pick any card they choose
from their fresh piles, not revealing the cards until both cards are
picked.
After both cards are picked, they are turned face-up.

One of three possibilities takes place:

1) If the one player's card number divides the number on the other
player's card, then the player with the dividing number (not with the
divided number) gets 2 points added to his/her score. The players then
both put their cards in their own moldy pile (face-down), unless their
card is a 1. If 1, then go to possibility #3.

2) If the cards' numbers are not coprime, and neither number is a
divisor nor a multiple of the other card's number, then both players
get 1 point added to their scores. The cards are then placed in the
players' own moldy piles face-down.

3) If the cards' numbers are coprime, then the players exchange these
two cards with each other. The players then each put the newly-gotten
card in their own fresh pile, face-down.

(So, if one player has a 1, then he first gets 2 points added to his
score, then must exchange the card with his opponent. Both players
then put their cards back in their own fresh piles.)
(If both players pick the same number, then both players get 2 points
added to their score; then their cards are put in the moldy piles;
unless both cards are 1, in which case the cards are exchanged {if you
feel this is necessary} and put in the players' fresh piles.)

A player stays in the game until his/her fresh pile is exhausted, or
until he/she agrees to drop out.
(A player may agree to drop out if, say, it is clear that his
remaining cards in his fresh pile are each coprime to every card
remaining in every other player's fresh pile, and he has no 1. Then
there would be no point in continuing.)

The game continues until there is one player left.

Highest score wins.

Thanks,
Leroy Quet

PS: Does anyone still read Usenet anymore, by the way? Or has the
amount of spam there lately and the fact that many big internet
providers are no longer providing access to it severely cut down on
its readership?
