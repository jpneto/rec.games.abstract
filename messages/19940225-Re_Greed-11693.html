A friend of mine recently introduced me to the game `greed'. For those
who are not familiar with it, the rules are as follows:
The game is played on a rectangular grid. Each square in the grid contains
a number, usually in the range 1 - 9. The player is given an initial
starting location randomly chosen on the board
The player can move in eight directions for the number of squares equal
to the number adjacent to the current position in that direction. (How's
that for a confusing sentance? :-) It is not possible to move off the
board.
When making a move, all squares that are passed over in making the move
are cleared.
It is not possible to move over an already cleared square. The object of
the game is to clear as much of the board as possible (the score is the
percantage cleared) and the game ends when no moves remain.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Query: If a move would take you onto a cleared square or off the board,
do you move as far as possible without entering a cleared square? Or is
the move prohibited? Also I assume two diagonal clearing paths may cross
as long as they are on "opposite color checkered" squares, i.e. they
do not clear the same square. Yes? Thanks....
