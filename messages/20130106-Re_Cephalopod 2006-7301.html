Ambuscade: If two pieces' sum is equal to an enemy piece that is 
placed between the two (i.e. the enemy piece is within a move of 
both attacking pieces), the enemy piece is captured and removed 
from the board.

Exactly.  The piece in between is captured.  Not the surrounding pieces.  This is the opposite of Cephalopod.  In Cephalopod, you capture from within.  No other game has that, dumb ass.  Not Dice by Ludicton, not Go, and not Rithmomachy.  Your desperate attempts to equate Cephalopod to totally unrelated games continue to be laughable.  Keep trying, Monsieur Buffoon.

What the fuck did <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> invent, Monsieur Buffoon?  Sideways Hex?  You don't have the first clue how to design games.

Would you be happier if it were Player 1?  It has to be one or the other in a finite-decisive game with optimal play.   

Your only skill with games is knowing how to look them up on Wikipedia, A.H..  What a dumb ass you are.
