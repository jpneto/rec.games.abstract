Clark, you really haven't wandered too far from the fold.  There was the
whirlwind romance with inept, old goat Bill Taylor.  And yes, there was the
farcical, premature ejaculation of a "discussion group", rgc rofl.  The most
absurd part was you as moderator.  Clark, you have to admit, people look for
maturity, even handedness, integrity and so forth in a moderator - the
antithesis of you.

But all of that is not for me to judge.  Are you going to be permanently
fucked up like Ralf Gering now, or is there any possibility of moving past
this shit?  I think people would rather hear about your next game than your
next political viewpoint about rec.games.abstract.

You know what your problem with me is, Clark?  You compliment my games and
you naturally expect me to reciprocate the good will.  Quid pro quo.  Wrong.
 I don't compliment people's games unless I like them.

You're already way ahead of the pack with one decent game, Clark - Particle
Bond.  Stop talking and start designing.  Tic toc...
