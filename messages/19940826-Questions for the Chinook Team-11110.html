I have some questions, mostly speculative, but some factual.  I
asked some earlier, but got no answer.

1) How does Chinook do in 11-man ballot against top players?  There
the opening knowledge does not count as much except by transposition.

2) Is there a comparable program for pool checkers?

3) This one is more philosophical.  I know who Marion Tinsley and Don
Laffert are.  There is no identity issue there.  But suppose the Chinook
program source code were licensed (meaning there were multiple copies) and
each was independently improved.  Which one is the World Champion?  I presume
that an improvement of the code (or say additions to its database) 
do not alter its being Chinook.  Nor would moving to a different computer. 
Or does it?

Do you see my problem?
