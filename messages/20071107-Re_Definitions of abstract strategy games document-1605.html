It sounds like you fall into the "Mind sports" category here which
would end up allowing for Duplicate Bridge to be part of it.
Duplicate Bridge is allowed by the Mind Sports Association and looks
to be played in China next year after the Olympics.  But would it fit
into an association of abstract strategy games?  Doesn't seem like a
fit for me, which is the reason for the rules around equipment being
so and so (pieces in a play area and their position determining
outcome).  You allow a one off for games like Nomic or my Free Cell
game, but that is it, so you don't cause the list of games to spiral
out of control.

I'm more interested in empirical pragmatism, and ISTM that democracy Is
Your Friend here:

"Why doesn't IAGO properly support by way of tournaments my very boring
and simplistic game which meets all of your requirements for an AGS?"

"Because it needs two players, and you're the only one who wants to play
it."

An association is there to serve the needs of its members.  If the
membership have joined up to "work with games that have the longest
lasting appeal, but have the most problems in the marketplace" then
that's the sort of games they'll be interested in.  There's no need to
formally define things into or out of existence, you can let people play
what they want to play.  My guess is you won't have problems with
everyone playing bridge rather than GIPF, even though it's a far more
popular game, because Bridge already has plenty of outlets for serious
play.  Similarly Backgammon would probably be more actively pursued
elsewhere, but how about more obscure Tables variants?  Those are the
very sort of games you say you want to work with, so why fiddle with
definitions to allow you to do that?  Why not just say "this is
abstract, it's strategic, I'm interested, I've got a dozen friends who
are as well, let's play the thing!"

The size of the list of <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>potential<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> games needn't be an issue if you
only address the ones a certain quorum of the membership want to play
under an IAGO banner.  It's also much easier to rule things out on
pragmatic grounds than to have to switch to lawyer mode any time there's
a borderline case.
