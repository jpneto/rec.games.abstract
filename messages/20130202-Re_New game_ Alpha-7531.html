I'm not sure if the object as such never showed up in the general thematic shuffle around the largest group and/or the smallest number of groups, but the either color option looks like an interesting new approach.

I'm not sure if it's a new idea either. The ability to place either color with no restrictions means that Alpha can be considered a Mind Ninja subgame.. I've checked all the available goal patterns in the Mind Ninja implementation on igGC and this one isn't included, so I'm assuming that either Nick hasn't thought of it or he has but concluded that it was lame. I hope it was the former. ;-)

The tie-rule is funny but that doesn't justify it. It interferes somewhat with the pie-rule at the start - that is supposed to solve unbalance. Dictating this solution for a draw doesn't quite agree with me I fear. I'd rather accept the possibility of a draw, though I'm aware of the controversy regarding draws of course, so there's no need to explain why I'm wrong ;-)

Yeah, there's no need to get into that old discussion once again. :)

On a side note, all the Mind Ninja subgames with a scoring system (Product War, for instance) have implicitly a similar tie-breaker, since the blocker player only needs an equal score to win. The rules as written on igGC imply that ties are won by the first player instead of the second, but in the subgames with scoring I think it's better to have it the other way round, at least when played as independent games with the pie rule instead of the Mind Ninja opening protocol. If ties are won by the first player, he'll have to chose a slightly worse first move, and the number of available bad first moves is usually quite low already. Also, more often than not, he'll have one stone more than the opponent in the final position, so awarding ties to the latter should be a fair countermeasure.
