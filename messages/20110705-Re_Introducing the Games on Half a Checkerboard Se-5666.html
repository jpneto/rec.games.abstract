<br><blockquote type=cite>This post is to do a brief get the word out about the Games on Half a

<br>may games could be created for, and adopted to, half a
<br>checkerboard.

<br>If anyone is interested, you can check this list out on Boardgame
<br>Geek.&nbsp; Here is a short URL to the list of the games, with the rules
<br>downloadable also:

<br>
<br>I am taking a break from the Series.&nbsp; I am looking to eventually get
<br>the Series up to 32 games for it, one for each space on the board,
<br>which will likely grow increasingly different, and likely not be
<br>abstract strategy games.&nbsp; I will let you decide if the games are all
<br>bullocks, boring, or uninspired derivative shlock, or whatever.&nbsp; There
<br>is a mix of old and new in there, for a number of reasons.
<br>
<br>Anyhow, thank you for your time...
