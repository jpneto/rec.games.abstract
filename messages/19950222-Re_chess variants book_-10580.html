This book is good, but a few of the rules given are incorrect.  (Most
notably the rules for "Intermediate Japanese Chess (Chu Shogi)" but over
all, its pretty interesting.

Another good book of game variants including a wide variety of chess
variants is R. Wayne Schmittburger's "New Rules for Classic Games".  I
saw it not too long ago in the bargain area of Barnes &amp; Noble and at
several other bookstores.

There has been "encyclopedia of Chess Variants" discussed on
rec.games.chess.  (I could have the title wrong and i don't know the
author.)  But, it's gotten many favorable comments over there.

I don't like disclaimers, but I have to put them in.  The opinions here
are my own and not necessarily PG&amp;E's.
(As if it had any opinions about this stuff!)
