The first two points are two sides of the same problem - a small

A simple way of achieving this is to increase the board size. It won't
change the number of moves in the opening, but there will be more
moves in the mid game. However, I don't think this will be nearly
enough without going to very large boards (16x16 or bigger) and that
will make games take far too long.

In fact, two of the top Cambridge players (Pete Bhagat and Imre Leader)
has a go at 12x12 Othello many years ago and found that even that size
has a major shortcoming: it's essentially impossible ever to control a
line, so the usual aspects of Othello tactics to do with access denial
are essentially gone.

However, with 10x10 Othello this seems not to be true (as reported by
the top players in the 10x10 events that I've organised at the last two
Mind Sports Olympiads).  I have been pushing 10x10 Othello partly for
reasons of opening theory exhaustion of 8x8, but even more because I'm
not at all sure you're right that one must increase the board size a
lot before computers start to have problems.  The problem with 8x8 is
that the midgame has shrunk to about 5 moves: the top programs can now
play perfectly from at least 24 empty.  They could probably do so in
10x10 too, but with so much less opening theory (maybe out to move 12
in the foreseeable future as against 25 in 8x8 now) that means the
midgame is over 60 moves.  The ability of computers to beat top humans
at 10x10 Othello has not yet been well tested and I very much hope that
it will be soon.  At present I know of one 10x10 program online, and I
haven't tried it; this is from an email from Chris Welty:

Hi, there is a 10x10 computer program called "MisterX" on GGS now,
written by Kostas Tournavitis. It is much better than I am. I don't know
how it would do against strong humans, but you might want to try it out.

I would very much welcome reports on its calibre.
