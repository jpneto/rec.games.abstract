 I am interested to know if anyone knows anything about the game "truco."
It is a game played mainly in South America I believe.  I would like to
know the rules and the variations in the rules if anyone knows them. (i.e.
I believe there are slightly different versions of the rules in Brazil,
Peru, Bolivia, etc...).  Please post or e-mail... Thanks!

The last time I played Truco was in B.A., Argentina, where it is the
card game of choice.  A standard naipe deck is used.  Each player gets
three cards.  There are two parts to the scoring: enbido and truco.  To
start, the enbido is worth zero and the truco 1.  Either player may, at
any time before the last card is played, call "truco" which raises the
value of the truco section to 2 points if his opponent accepts, or ends
the hand giving 1 point to the player who called truco if refused.
If truco is accepted at two points, the player who did NOT call truco
may (any time before the last card is played) call "retruco" which
either raises the truco value to three (iff accepted) or give the two
points to the one who called retruco if refused (ending the hand).
Likewise "vale quarto" is an optional responce to "retruco" (which 
either raises to 4 or wins at 3).  Nothing higher than "vale quarto"
is allowed.

Any time before the last card is played or a refused truco ends the
hand, either player may call "enbido" (you may call enbido before you
decide to accept/reject an offered truco).  This may be refused (giving
the caller one point but not ending the hand), accepted (making the
enbido worth two points), or "re-enbido" (refuse and give two or accept
and enbido is worth three) The re-enbido, unlike re-truco, must be
called immediately after the enbido.  Enbido Quarto is the maximum
responce (accept to make enbido worth four or reject to give 3 points)
which must immediately follow re-enbido.

If an enbido call is accepted (not raised or rejected), then each player
chooses two cards (possibly including those already played) from his
hand.  Sum the numbers of the two cards for each player, adding 20 if
the cards are the same suit.  Higher player wins the current value of
enbido (and no further enbido may be called this hand).

For the truco part, each player plays a card for each trick.  Highest
card wins each tricks.  2 of 3 tricks wins the truco points.

The order of "highest card" is non-trivial.  There are four special
cards which rank apart from all the others (the one of swords and the 
one of cups and the seven of coins and the seven of swords, in that
order).  After that, the ranks are ace first, then higher number.
If the rank is equal, the suits tie break in this order: sword, coin,
cup, club.  The special cards beat any non-special card.

A typical way to play is to have two teams of three.  Each player will
get three cards, and play versus the player sitting opposite (who will
be on the other team).  After each pair has played (with dealer playing
first, then player to the left of dealer playing first, then player to
the left of dealer playing first, and so on.  When all pairs have
played, the deal passes left and play continues.  Winning is usually
50 or 100 points, depending on how much time you have.  With 8 players,
100 points is almost always used.

The interesting part is that unlike bridge, it is legal to signal your
teammates to show them what cards you have (you can't actually show them
your cards, but you can use coded facial gestures -- winking your left
eye means you have the ace of swords, for example.  the trick is to
make the gestures when only your teammates are looking)

I hope that the above isn't too confusing--- I've never thought of the
rules to truco in english before and may have lost something in the
translation, but I think the general idea is there.
