This is one reason I think an abstracts games organization might not
be a bad idea. Get up the status of "other" abstract boardgames a
little. People have different talents, why shouldn't they be allowed
to explore the areas where they have a comparative advantage, in
competitive games as in everything else?

Having an organization represent them helps in getting them to be
taken more seriously.  It gives it a place where a game can grow with
enough attention to eventually break off and form its own association
around it.  Also, there is a case of players who are "Jacks" who can
play a wide range of games well, but rather not try to be a master of
one.  Why not support them?

But I must second Mark Steere's worry about a "governing body". I'm a
bit discouraged that the first thing IAGO did was define a "standard"
piece set, which excluded all my favourite abstract games.

"Standard" is a term to represent what would quantify of the baseline
of equipment IAGO members would be expected to have to see a bulk of
games that people design.  It is a standardize platform for insure
that a designer knows enough people will play his games (it is the
compromise point between players, designers and manufacturer/
marketplace).  Think of it as a Playstation for abstract strategy
games.  It is to resolve issues like Camelot faces, which has few
people playing it, because they first don't own the board to play it
on.  Second, they seldom seen the rules.  It represents the boundaries
of what would go into a normal IAGO abstract strategy set, and
baseline for the normal IAGO tournaments.  This standard set allows
for an increasing number of games to get exposure.  It also serves as
a basis for Athlon tournaments.

However, note there is also the "Alternative" category which is for
everything else, and it includes non-commercial and commercial games.
These games will also get coverage, and should also have a "Design of
the Year" category for them.  The naming is to inform people to be
prepared to have to get extra equipment to play the game, or for legal
reasons, have to purchase a commercial copy of the game.  And yes, I
will look for IAGO to also sponsor tournaments in these games.  Odds
are each game will end up having its own standalone tournament, and
own champion, rather than being part of an Athlon.

It is just there needs to be some sort of baseline to insure there is
some baseline of what can get out there.
