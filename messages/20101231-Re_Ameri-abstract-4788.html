I'm tired of hearing
this shit about Germans being so non-confrontational that they can't even
bear confrontational games.

I am from Germany and I always wondered why so called eurogames are
considered as less confrontational. The people who brought up this
obvious never played "El Grande" one of the most famous classic
eurogames. Actually, in German exists the term "Ärgerfaktor" ("teasing
factor" or "madden factor"). It describes how much a game is
confrontational.

The problem is not an aversion to confrontation.  It's an aversion to humor.

Germans are not know for their humor. But there are also some funny
board and card games created in Germany. For example Bohnanza.
By the way: Some days ago I discovered a German comedy duo from the
1970ies which did some radio play sketches with a humor quite similar
to the humor of Monty Python.
