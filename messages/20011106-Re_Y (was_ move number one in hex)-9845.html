I thought Y was played on a board in which most cells have 5 neighbors,

I found a couple sites and they said that the interior cells have 6
neighbors though there is a commercially available version where
three of the interior cells have only five neighbors.  I didn't
find any description of Mudcrack Y.

Following the link that Jan posted (to reviews of Y), I found
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstract.htm#MY">http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstract.htm#MY</a>
which shows a picture of the game board.

My recollection of 5- and 6-neighbored cells was reversed.  Most of the
cells have 6 neighbors.  But three (at least 3) have only 5 neighbors (to
find them, count 5 cells in along the lines from the corners to the center).

Mudcrack Y is mentioned all the way at the bottom of Jan's link
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/revugy.htm">http://www.gamepuzzles.com/revugy.htm</a>
but only in reference to the fact that Kadon has a few copies of a book on
that game available for sale (I have that book, but I can't locate it at the
moment).

I also recall seeing a site from the inventor of Y, and I think it describes
most of the history of the game.  I do not recall the link, though.
