Hi abstract gamers,

As many of you probably know, I keep The World of Abstract Games website
[<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv">www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv</a>] where are, at this moment, 3 different sections,
namely,

i) Go Variations;
ii) Games of Soldiers (i.e., games played with Go stones)
iii) Games of King and Soldiers (i.e., games played with two types of pieces
on two colors)

Since many of those games (more than 60 in the last two sections, and
couting!) are very easy to implement in Zillions (and many of those were
already been programmed) I wonder if there is someone interested in joining
the effort to code as many games as possible, so that those ZRFs (Zillion
Rule Files) could be accessed by people through the net.

Please send me an email,

Cheers,

Joao Pedro Neto
