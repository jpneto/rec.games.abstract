For Christian, but also for the wider community, as there's more abstract thoughts in this one than the Redstone topic.

I've played one game so far, and I think I strategically made a few sound plans and the game ended rather one sided, which means it's hard to fine tune where my mistakes were, but there were some interesting insights.

Knight's jumps are connected. Obviously, they are one move only moves, but I suspect they make a lot of sense for individual expansion. If you need to, you can connect in one turn, at the cost of slower expansion from then on..

The game is fundamentally territorial I think, rather than influence and fighting orientated - I suspect one of the main reasons for that is that the growth is orthagonal, and that's an inefficient way of moving on a square tiled board. As a result, it's easy to earmark territory and simply expand it. I'm unsure, but 3rd line plays seem good places to go early on.

Some of the connection plays are interesting, and bear a lot of similarities to hex. Have a few groups and you can place some unlikely looking stones and find ways of connecting them up anyway. I'm actually thinking that this game may benefit from a Hex board. The fact that only 6 stones are needed to capture a single stone rather than 8 (you can argue 4 of course, but no-one's going to make single placements just to capture single stones, so extension principles will apply - it's just more burdensome to corner stones and groups off on a square board), and extensions can be in 6 directions rather than 4, and connection is simply rather cuter on a hex board, makes me think the gameplay mechanics are more optimally designed for it.

Do you have a version of Syhex I can play with by any chance? :P
