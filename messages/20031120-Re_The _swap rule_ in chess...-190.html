Not necessarily, because an initial move that's strong in standard chess
is not necessarily strong in swap-chess.

Suppose that Alice starts as White, and Bob as Black.

* Alice doesn't want to make an opening move that is strong in standard
  chess (e.g. P-K4), because Bob will then choose to become White.

* Alice doesn't want to make an opening move that is weak in standard
  chess (e.g. P-KB3), because Bob will then choose to remain Black.

* Assuming that Bob is a reasonably skilled player, Alice's best
  strategy is to make a mediocre move, such that neither of Bob's
  choices (switch or don't switch) is particularly better or worse
  than the other.

Is it that easy? It's by no means clear to me that P-KB3 is such a bad
move that the advantage actually passes immediately to Black. It is
probably high on the list of questionable starts though. I think that
if you were playing White and I could choose your first move, I might
pick P-KR4.

Anyway I think the swap rule in chess is a kind of interesting
proposal. If it were adopted in serious high-level play, psychological
factors would be considered as well as objective ones. Sometimes, for
example, you may know that your opponent has made a deep study of
systems with P-Q4 but never plays P-K4. In that case you could try
P-K4 and present him with a dilemma: it's a good opening move but one
he doesn't know much about.

P.S. An alternative proposal for neutralizing the White advantage was
posted to the chess newsgroups a few months ago: simply award points
in a way that cancels out White's statistical advantage. For example:
White gets 10 points for a win, 4 for a draw, 0 for a loss; Black gets
11 points for a win, 5 for a draw, 1 for a loss.
