Interesting mechanism.  I've played around with the "grab" but never got
anywhere with it.

Meaning what? You couldn't get a game finished? Or is it just a smear
without an argument?

From the rule sheet:

"If a player after the first capture can proceed in a similar matter he may
do so, but is not obliged to do so. A multiple capture may be terminated at
any square."

There's one very good reason for forcing continued captures.  It lets
players know when a turn has concluded.  Without forced, continued
capturing, you have to derail your opponent's thought process with the
announcement, "I finished my move.  Your turn" - an aesthetic Hiroshima..

The premisse here is that Grabber is an elimination game. It is not.
You may well find yourself with a board full of your pieces and no
capture.
Forced completion of multiple captures runs counter to the game's
objective: you try to increase your own options for capture, while
reducing your opponent's, not to waste captured because the rules
oblige you to do so. Forced completion would upset if not unsettle
strategical thinking.
On the other hand it should not be forbidden: sometimes proceeding a
capture serves a strategical or tactical goal.

I checked and I got history on my side: according to wiki, Konane was
invented by ancient Hawaiian Polynesians, so it has shown some
enduring power. Now check this:
"The player can stop hopping enemy pieces at any time, but must at
least capture one enemy piece in a turn."
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konane">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konane</a>

Grabber is much richer tactically than Konane, because prisoners get
liberated in the process of capture. Black column will emerge as white
ones and vice versa. My solitary games typically end when the number
of pieces has been reduced to about half the initial number, and in
around 20-30 moves by both sides.

Like Clobber and Konane it will generate puzzles like the shortest/
longest possible game, the greatest possible reduction of pieces, but
also: highest possible stack.

Maybe you should have a better look when you're less distracted ;-)
