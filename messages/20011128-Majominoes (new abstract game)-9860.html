Last night during a caffeine-induced insomnia, I came up with a new abstract
pencil &amp; paper game for two players that I thought was interesting.  I call
it "Majominoes", a combination of "majority" and "polyominoes".  What
follows is a description of the rules, and then some questions.

I've cross-posted this since I think both groups would have an interest in
it.


Rules
-----

1) The game is played on an NxN square divided into N regions, each of N
cells.  N should be odd.  The division of regions is done at random (or in
any other manner the players agree on) prior to to the start of the game.
Here's a typical 5x5 board:

+--+--+--+--+--+
|           |  |
+  +--+--+--+  +
|  |     |     |
+--+  +--+--+  +
|     |     |  |
+--+  +--+  +  +
|  |  |  |  |  |
+  +--+  +  +--+
|        |     |
+--+--+--+--+--+

2) One player is 'X', the other 'O'.  X goes first, and players take turns
marking a cell with their symbol.  To offset the advantage of X going first,
O is allowed to make two marks during one (just one) of her turns.  Once a
cell is marked, it cannot be marked again.  Play continues until all cells
are marked.

3) The player with the most marks in a row, column, or region gets a point.
The player with the most points wins.  Note that draws are impossible.

Scoring Example:

+--+--+--+--+--+          +--+--+--+--+   +--+  +--+      +--+
| o  o  x  o| x|  -- (o)  | o  o  x  o|   | x|  | x|      | x|
+  +--+--+--+  +          +  +--+--+--+   +  +--+  +   +--+  +
| x| x  x| o  x|  -- (x)  | x|            | o  x  x|   | o  x|
+--+  +--+--+  +          +--+   (o)      +--+--+--+   +--+  +
| o  o| o  x| o|  -- (o)                      (x)         | o|
+--+  +--+  +  +                                      (o) +  +
| x| o| x| x| o|  -- (x)                                  | o|
+  +--+  +  +--+             +--+--+   +--+--+            +--+
| o  x  x| o  o|  -- (o)     | x  x|   | o  x|
+--+--+--+--+--+          +--+  +--+   +--+  + (o)
                          | o  o|         | x|
  |  |  |  |  |           +--+  + (o)     +  +--+
 (o)(o)(x)(o)(o)             | o|         | o  o|
                             +--+         +--+--+

          x  o
         -- --
Rows:     2  3
Columns:  1  4
Regions:  1  4
         -- --
Total:    5 10


Questions
---------

1) Without O's double move, under perfect play the game would be a win for X
(regardless of the regions used).  Can you prove this?

2) Does allowing O a double move allow O to force a win on some boards?

3) Is there any advantage to O delaying the use of her double move?  In
other words, shouldn't she just always use it on her first turn?

4) It is X's turn to move.  O has already used her double move.  Who wins?

+--+--+--+--+--+
|  | o  o  o  x|
+  +--+--+  +--+
|  | o  o| x|  |
+  +--+  +--+  +
| o   | x  x|  |
+--+  +--+  +  +
| o|  |  | o| x|
+  +--+  +--+  +
| x      | x   |
