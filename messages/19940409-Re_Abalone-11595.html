You definitely want to stay away from the edges and you want to keep
your marbles together.  Try to attack your opponent in "thin" areas to
break her marbles up into small groups.  Even being cut into two equal
parts can be devistating.  A small, isolated set of marbles is as good
as dead, especially if they're not lined up the right way so that they
can exert their force toward the center of the board.  If you find
yourself in this situation, you should forget about them and try to
exert pressure on your opponent by breaking off a piece of her cluster
while she's preoccupied with your vulnerable pieces.  The Macintosh
version of this game plays pretty well using this strategy.
