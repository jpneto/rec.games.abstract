Another variant of the basic rules is to use a standard 8x8 checker
board and let one player play white and the other black.  Play is as
the basic rules (place pentominoes until no further move is
possible), but let the winner be the player with most squares of his
own colour uncovered at the end of the game.

Interesting, but probably <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>much<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> easier to analyze.  I know that
circa 1976 the classic Pentominoes game had been completely solved
up to the 5x5 board, and I would imagine it's up to the 7x7 or 8x8
by now.

What I tried to do with my variation was to introduce the possibility
(absent in Gardner's game and your variation) of games' lasting longer
than 6 moves for either player.  I'm a "middle game" sort of player;
I like games that involve moderately dynamic boards.  With regular
Pentominoes, the game ends before you can really get into it; and
[therefore] a decent "opening book" probably wins the game right off.

  maybe you could make the board bigger &amp; use the 35 hexominoes???

That involves cutting and storing 3.5 times as many cardboard
rectangles, for one thing.

The cool thing about pentominoes is that each of the twelve manages
to have a distinct "personality" in the context of the game.
With higher-order polyominoes, I think you lose the flavor of the
pieces; you get ones like

    ###     ##      ###
      ##     ###      ##
       #       ##      ##

that have a very similar visual "character."  I think (IMHO)
the human game-playing mind is most comfortable with a
small number of possibilities - 6 to 20.  E.g., values in
a deck of cards, types of chessmen, total number of checkers,
etc.  More than that, the mind can't handle comfortably.
Fewer than that, the mind handles trivially.  [Just my 2 cents.]

35*6 = 210.

  compared to 5*12 = 60, so instead of 49 or 64 you

Anything from 8x8 to 14x14 would do.
Anything larger than 15x15 would almost certainly
lead to trivial draws (since all the pieces seem to
fit easily onto a 225-square board - I didn't check).

 HOWEVER, then this could
  possibly result in a lot of trivial middle game moves leading
  up to the big crunch at the end.

  or open it up to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> polyominoes.

Xoids again. :)
I've read the rules since my last post, and Xong
looks somewhat interesting.  It probably is playable
with paper and pencil (unlike my pentominoes
variation), so that's a point in its favor.
Now the rules are getting fuzzy in my brain again,
though.  But I'm trying to keep this thread
pentomino-based. :-)


I'm still interested in getting analytic
feedback on the game.  If I have time this
week, maybe I'll post some endgame puzzles
or something.
