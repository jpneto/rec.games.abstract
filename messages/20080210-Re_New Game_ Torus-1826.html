Ok, thank you.  I will have the last word then.  You made this post an
hour and a half after I posted my proof that Torus is an equal goals
game.  You know?  The proof that you conveniently ignored?  The proof
that refuted your big claim to fame that your variant of my game has
equal goals and that my game doesn't?

Now you're embarrassed, rightfully so, and you're heading for the
hills.  Fine.  Don't come back.

Your obsessive compulsion with claiming standard games

Ohhhh.  So now it's a "standard game".  If it's so standard then why
did you attempt to claim it as your own?  And I quote:

"So there it is - the first (?) fully operational torus style
connection game.  And named after New Zealand - YAY!"

That was you announcing a variant of my game an hour and a half (your
usual lag time) after I announced my game, and calling your variant
"the first".

So now that I've refuted your big claim to fame that your variant of
my game has equal goals and that my game doesn't, you're going to toss
a little stink bomb and run away.  How dishonest and cowardly.

Yes, it will.  History will judge us by the games we designed.  My
shadow isn't such a bad place to be, is it Bill?
