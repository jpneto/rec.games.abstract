Christian exhaustively berates Nick Bentley in the Arimaa forum for daring to admire Redstone:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nick questioned the balancing mechanism for Redstone, but later 
called the game a viciously good invention. ... Nick apparently 
is blinded by simplicity of concept ... Barring other reasons for 
his praise of Redstone, I'd say he values the right concepts, but 
lacks the intuition to see how they might pan out in an actual 
game. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Poor, simple Nick - whose super balanced Ketchup is a role model for Symple..

Christian concludes:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Redstone sucks, but it may take determined supporters a while 
to find that out. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't doubt your sincerity in trashing Redstone, Christian, but I think you're viewing it through jealousy colored glasses.  Instead of interest and controversy surrounding Symple, as you had so counted on, there is only silence.  Instead, interest and controversy surround Redstone, and you can't bear it.  The din of Redstone praise obfuscates your objectivity.

Christian's pro-Redstone conspiracy theory expands to include Luis Bolanos Mures:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have a low opinion of Redstone and was just surprised that the
inventor's claims were left unchallenged by knowledgeable people 
like Nick and Luis. So let me be more precise, for those who cannot
immediately see this monkey's disease. 

A contagious disconnect...
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The only disconnect I see is between your Redstone evaluation and others', Christian.  Nick Bentley and Luis Bolanos Mures have reviewed Redstone in glowing terms.  But to you, Redstone is a sucky, contagious monkey disease.  Pretty extreme, wouldn't you say?  Pretty broad chasm in perspectives.  You betray your deep seated animosity, fueled by insatiable jealousy, for what is after all... only a game.

Christian quotes Graham, a 2 dan Go player who has played Redstone twice:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My initial impression of Redstone, from having played it twice 
now, is one of interest. Strategically, it's basically Go, but 
with a few twists. Tactically, it has an inherent system that I'm
inclined to believe increases the depth of complexity quite a bit. 
This will have an impact on strategy, but I'm not entirely sure 
what yet.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Christian bristles:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Notice how Redstone's disconnect is translating into a similar 
disconnect in the argument: if the increased depth of complexity has 
an as yet unknown impact on strategy, then calling the strategy 
'basically like Go' boils down to presenting fog as clarity. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Speaking of presenting fog as clarity, what's your dan level, Christian?  How many times have you actually played Redstone?  I'm guessing zero on both counts.  Yet you fly in the face of someone you've called a "knowledgeable Go player".

Christian voluminous case against Redstone picks up steam:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Show a Go master a middle game position and he'll know in seconds 
what it is about, because of his experience, and because the game 
has great clarity. [Redstone] has no clarity. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The degree of clarity is inherent in a game to a large degree, but to some extent it depends on experience.  Maybe Redstone has no clarity for you, Christian, because you simply don't understand it.  Because you've never played it.  Your "intuition" would be a little more credible if it didn't stand in polar contradiction to the actual experiences of others more knowledgeable than thou.

Nick Bentley's spine begins to buckle under the strain of Christian's sustained brow beating:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My opinion on Redstone: I assume that a) it's balanced for most of 
us who play it now; b) at higher levels of play, it will be 
imbalanced (can't prove it, but that's my thought); but that's ok 
because c) some kind of swap protocol will fix it. My statement about
"vicious goodness" depends especially on c) being true. I emphasize 
that my opinions are provisional 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Aren't all of our opinions provisional, Nick, until reality either confirms or refutes them?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
- my intuition doesn't work well enough for me to be confident (to
corroborate your point about my intuition). 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Your intuition is as good as anyone's, Nick, including and especially Christian's.  Christian hand-waved the international distress signal for months in the Arimaa forum while he continually tweaked his games.  The intuition that's always impeccable except when it isn't (like with Redstone).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
My experience with Redstone comes from a bunch of games 
I've played against myself, which also complicates evaluation.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's "a bunch" more times than Christian has played Redstone.

Christian digresses on Symple:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Why do you think Mark is so troubled by Symple? It's enough to know 
that in his view a game, ideally, should be finite, drawless and 
perfectly balanced. You kind of got away with it with Ketchup (Wink).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not the least bit "troubled" by Symple, lol  I can't imagine anything more innocuous, pallid, or insipid than Symple.  What has troubled me is your relentless campaign to convince everyone that Symple is "perfectly balanced", whatever that even means.

The pro-Redstone conspiracy has now grown to include Clyring, balking at Christian's diatribe in the Arimaa forum:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think your remarks on Redstone are too harsh. Although the final 
goal of the game is elimination, this is achieved by gaining a 
territorial advantage. Since red stones can only be placed to 
capture a group and suicide via a regular stone is illegal, groups 
with two or more eyes are safe until the only legal moves are to 
fill these eyes. When this happens, the player who was able to create 
more extra eyes for his groups will be the last player compelled 
to sacrifice his own groups. Of course, the number of extra eyes is 
not the same as territory, but the two are nevertheless closely 
related. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Right on the money.  Even I understand this.

When push comes to shove, roll out the red herrings and tap dance your ass off.  Christian blowing smoke at Clyring:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Since we're engaged in a game of Symple you know I can but agree. 
It's the same mechanism only Symple is co-existential and Redstone 
isn't - I'd almost add 'how could it be?' 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What????

Christian reverts to quoting Graham, a real Go expert:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
My game against illluck was an eye-opener, as I fabricated a living 
group out of thin air inside my opponent's territory. There are a 
number of hane / crosscut situations which simply don't work in Go, 
but do in Redstone, as you can end up with eyes appearing out of 
nowhere when red stones hit the board. It's also clear that two point 
eyes are frequently not eyes at all, and single stone self atari 
sacrifice play has gained a lot of leverage.
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Christian contradicts the Go expert:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In Redstone you'll have to consider the position after a capture much 
more carefully than in Go. Some may consider that a good quality, I
consider it a bad effect on clarity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Conclusions

None of my games have generated anywhere near as much controversy as Redstone has.  Usually my games are completely ignored.

Christian Freeling's open ended rant comprises at least half of the hoopla.  Redstone must have touched a nerve.  If it's that much of a burr in Christian's underwear, it must be good :)
