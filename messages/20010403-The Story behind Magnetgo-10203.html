Mostly oral tradtion and hand-written manuscripts written in a script  i
invented when i was 9 years old and still use today.

I just described "Pantherk�stchen".

To comfort you, I will describe a well-known Go variant called "electric Go"
or "Magnetgo".


The Story behind Magnet-Go
======================

I was a member of the Go Club in Bonn / Germany  in the early 1980s. At this
time I composed the longest Go problem in Go history (as far as i know)
called  "Labyrinth" (314 moves), which was published in the "Deutsche
Go-Zeitung".

Also i invented "Magnetgo" ("Magnetic Go"). The editor of the German
Go-Zeitung, who lived in Bonn and was a friend of mine, however, disliked
the name because he thought it could be confused with a go set which has
magnetic go stones. So he called it "Elektrisches Go" and published the game
without my approval in the "Deutsche Go-Zeitung". The game later become
known in the Go world as "electric Go" and was played at the Hitachi
European Go Congress 2000 (won by Michael Marz (2D), Germany -- whom i would
like to call the inofficial "Magnet-Go"- World Champion) and at the 1997
U.S.-Go Congress. The game is also known in Brazil. The inventor, however,
has fallen into oblivion -- until recently.

I cannot tell you what are the "official" tournament rules of my game, but i
can tell you the original rules:

Magnetgo is played like standard Go mostly following the Japanese rules. You
have to count the Japanese way.

These are the differences:

1. Suicide is allowed, IF (!) the position on the
    board changes with that move.
2. A move consists of one, two or three  stages:
    a. You place one of your stones on an empty
         intersection of the board.
    b. Stones are "magnetic". They repulse stones
         of the same color ("charge") or attract
         stones  of the same color. This force is
         only exerted orthogonally in up to four
         directions. Only the next orthogonal stone in
         each direction is pushed away (if it has the
         same color) or  attracted (if it is an
         opponent's stone). In each direction only ONE
         stone can be (and, if  possible, MUST be)
         moved. The stones must  be moved as far as
         possible, either until they  reach the edge of
         the board or another stone,  if repulsed, or
         until they are on the adjacent  intersection, if
         they are attracted. The stone which you have
         just placed on the board is NOT moved.
     c. If any stone or group of your opponent has
         lost its last liberty, these stones are captured
         and removed from the board. You have to
         store them until the game is finished.
         Remember: I count the Japanese way! Then,
         you remove your stones or groups  which
         have still no liberty. These stones are given
         to your opponent and count one point each at
         the end of the game for him/ her like any other
         stones you have lost or are not
         unconditionally alive.
