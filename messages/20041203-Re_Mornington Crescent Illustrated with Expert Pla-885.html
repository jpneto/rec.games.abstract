Perhaps as a consequence of the formally less-than-conclusive proof,
Minski never got the recognition he deserved - or not, at least, until
it was far too late.  He was unable to secure academic work commensurate
with his talents, and became insecure and probably depressed.  In 1968
he claimed to be receiving half-eaten sausages in the post, but never
produced any evidence, and there is no record of any complaint to the
authorities.  One photograph from this time shows a strange figure in
long hair and colourful, possibly even home-made clothing - not
completely unheard-of at the time perhaps, but a remarkable contrast
with the dapper young student of a few years previously.  Another
picture from around the same time shows him in more conventional attire
(he was to attend a court hearing concerning a relatively minor but
unsavoury matter, the details of which I prefer not to discuss here).
Although at first glance he looks little different from his 1964
persona, the eyes look lost and vacant, and I do not believe it is an
artefact of the photographic process.

[The information and images relating to Minski's life in the late '60s
come from E. R. Smith's <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Curse Of Mornington Crescent<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (now, alas,
long out of print).  Although Smith's "grisly but light-hearted romp
through the ages" is not exactly reliable (the tales relating to pre-
Romanic Egypt are almost certainly apocryphal) he is better when he can
collate printed media, and for more recent events in his compendium he
often conducted postal interviews with witnesses - including the sad
story of Minski's decline, which he follows in salacious detail until
1972, then abandons.  Smith makes no mention at all of Minski's death,
and was probably unaware of it.]

Although Minki's downward spiral into depression and substance abuse began
already in the early 1970s, he was only institutionalized in 1973.  His
family kept details of his mental condition a well-guarded secret for many
years, by creating the illusion that Minski was living a reclusive life on
an island in the Pacific, and devoting his full attention to further studies
of Mornington Crescent eliptical play.  The truth about Minksi's tragic end
only emerged in 1985, as a result of a media interview with Minksi's second
cousin, Sarah Bodington (at that time an emerging prospect in the junior
division of the Tic Tac Toe National Championship).  When asked whether any
publications on Mornington Crescent eliptical play were forthcoming as a
result of Minski's self-imposed Pacific island isolation, Bodington
disclosed that Minski had been found dead of a drug overdose in a New York
subway station in October 1975, after being released from the psychiatric
hospital on a weekend pass.  At any rate, the Minski family's silence on the
subject for many years would account for Smith not recounting the tragic
conclusion of Minski's life.  Even the April 1975 issue of Mornington
Crescent Journal that finally brought Minski's ground-breaking research into
the public eye, stated that Minksi was not available for comment due to a
self-imposed exile in the Pacific to further his research on Mornington
Crescent.  Tragically, Minski was in fact in the United States at that very
moment, but in a drug-induced coma and with less than six months to live.

Although Smith could not be expected to be aware of this in 1982 when he
published his excellent book, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Curse Of Mornington Crescent<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, he does
have an excellent chapter on "Mornington Crescent and Psychosis", that may
offer insights about Minski.  Smith posits a relationship between the
intense study of Mornington Crescent and the early onset of pschyotic
delusions.  He argues that the serious study of Mornington Crescent has in
some cases led to mental disorders, in particular those with delusional
symptoms.  Unfortunately he only documents five study cases, but cites the
work of several psychiatrists, including the highly respected Dr. Kent
Armstrong and Dr. Yuraj Singh.  I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Singh at a
recent Mornington Crescent Convention in Delhi, India, and he made mention
of ongoing research in England that appears to support the thesis of a
definite relationship between Mornington Crescent and psychotic delusions,
which may well explain why so many excellent players are retiring at such a
young age.  I would love to hear from others who are more familiar with this
research, and whether these claims have any credibility.
