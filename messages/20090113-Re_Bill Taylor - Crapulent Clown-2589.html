Bill, just ignore Mark.  It could be that Mark is extra angry at you,
because you are the one who came up with the suggestion for the name
IAGO for IAGO.  Mark HATES IAGO now, because I deleted some messages
involving Ralf on the IAGO forum, overzealously, because I didn't want
IAGO to turn into a platform for the Mark-Ralf feud, and an interest
in banning Ralf for life.  Well, as of now, I don't control the forum,
but Mark is still cranky.

By the way, the name has stuck, eventhough people do look at it funny
from time to time.  I do want to thank you for your contribution.  I
am up for others you would want to make also.
