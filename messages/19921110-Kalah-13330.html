Along the lines of a previous post regarding Awari, does anyone know
anything about whether Kalah has been solved? Like Awari, it is a Mancala
game - that is, a game where the board is basically rows of pits
with stones in them. My guess is that no one has really ever bothered to
solve it, since it's not exactly the world's most well-known game.

As for the person asking about Awari, it's been a while since I read
the rules, but I'll take a look at it tonight. It shouldn't be
difficult to implement a minimax or alpha-beta algorithm which would
allow the computer to play pretty well. A few weeks ago I wrote out
a fairly similar program to play Kalah, and at its most difficult level,
it creams me (I suppose being able to look nine moves ahead gives it a
slight advantage).

Next, does anyone know of any companies which sell some of the
less widespred games? You know, someplace where I could maybe get
a Kalah board, or maybe Nine Men's Morris?

Lastly, I managed to get ahold of the CFV for this group, and cut out
the Charter. If anyone's interested, I can post it.
