Most of the top players refuse to play it.  Elbert Lowder is the world
11-man ballot champion.  We have not played him at 11-man ballot.
However, at "regular" checkers, our score is something like 12 wins,
0 losses and 10 draws.

Refresh my memory.  Is he a somewhat laconic fellow who lives in
Sanford, NC, or have I confused him with somebody else?

I have known only a few of the biggies.  I think I heard Ed Scheidt
retired from tournament play.  Is he still living?  I visited
him when he lived in Reston, Virginia, and after losing some
he asked to play a game of chess with me (my rating was 1950
as a chess player).  I got nervous and Scheidt actually beat 
me at my own game (he had a Class C rating, I believe).

And my good friend Rick Callaghan had as his goal achieving a 
similar or higher placement in checkers than he had in chess.
I hear that having won a regional tournament he decided he 
had done just that and lost interest.

There is a commercial program available that plays pool checkers.
Sage Draughts, by Adrian Millet, plays several variations of 
checkers/draughts.

I have a cheap straight checkers programs from COMPUTER EASY 
(copyright by William Clawson) but it takes forever at a decent level. 
Furthermore I discovered a bug (I should have written them, but didn't).
If one jumps into the last rank and becomes a king, the computer wants
to continue the move as a king.  When I discovered this I lost ineterest
in using it.

What would you recommend for a commercial straight checkers program?
One easy to find in a computer store and not that expensive, and
suitable for use in an old two floppy clone?
