Tournament straight checkers is played by balloting the first two 
Black moves and the first White.  Then each player takes a side
in turn, so if a position is weak you get to defend it once and
attack it once.  There are 142 combinations that can be balloted 
(or were in my day, some may have been added) and the top players
have the main lines from these memorized.

To counter, this 11-man-ballot was developed.  One first balloted 
out a man other than in tha last row for each side.  Then one balloted 
the first move for each side.  If the position did not lead to an immediate
loss of a man, it was played twice with each player taking Black in turn.
Should the man that was to move have been removed, the man behind in 
the same diagonal moves into its place.

As a novice with good intuition, but not extensive knowledge I favored this
version.  But very few players like it.  They have invested hours of study
on the openings and do not care for it.

Incidentally, while there are 11-man-ballot cards available, they are not
needed.  There are eight men to be removed for each side, and seven
possible first moves.  Write these down in four lists and enumeraate it. 
Each player then writes secretly two numbers from 1 to 8 and two from 1 to
7.  The respective numbers are added, and if the sum exceeds the highest
possible number (say 8 for the man Black is to remove) then that number is
subtracted from the sum.  This determines the opening position.
