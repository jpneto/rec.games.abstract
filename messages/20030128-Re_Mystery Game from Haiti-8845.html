I have a large carved wooden game board that my father got in Haiti in
the 1950s. It is like a coffee table with legs, and has carved fish
and animals on one side. On the other side there are 9 round wooden
depressions (like shallow bowls) of various sizes. They are arranged
in 3 rows of 3. He thinks it is designed for some sort of game. Does
anyone know what the game might be and how it would be played? Thanks
very much for any leads. I can e-mail a photo upon request.

We were all thinking it was a version of Mancala until you said 3 x 3.

Actually it could well be one of the large number of regional variations
on Mancala/Wari that are played on a non-"standard" board. Murray's
"History of Board Games other than Chess" Illustrates an example from
Benin that has a board with depressions in a 3 x 4 pattern. He also
illustrates varients with 3 x 6 patterns of bowls, and 4x6  and one that
is 4x28
