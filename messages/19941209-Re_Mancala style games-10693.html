This is not the case. A 4x8 board is used to play one of many 4x8
mancala games NOT a 2 x 16 game.

Here are the rules to BAO, one of the most complicated of the
4x8 mancala games.


Those interested in Mancala games should track down:

I don't think they are too hard to find in major librarys.

 From page 31 of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Mancala Games<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by L. Russ:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BAO

Bao, meaning 'board', is a generic name for several different mancala games 
played in East Africa. The game about to be described was presented at a 
meeting of the Kenya Museum Society in 1974.

This version of bao is played on a 2x8 board with two seeds in each hole 
at the start of play. Play is in laps in a counterclockwise direction 
until the last seed of a lap lands in an empty hole. [see note] If this 
empty hole is on the player's side of the board, he captures the contents, 
if any, of his opponent's opposite hole and the turn is ended. If the 
last seed of a lap falls into an empty hole on the opponent's side of 
the board, the player's turn is ended.

A player cannot start a move from a hole containing a single seed unless
the only seeds on his side of the board are singles. No further 
restrictions regarding singles are given, but it is possible that a rule 
from ndoto (as well as other games not yet discussed) is applicable here;
that is, singles can only be moved into unoccupied holes.

When a player has no seeds to move at his turn the game is over and his
opponent captures the remaining seeds. The winner is the player who captures
the greater number of seeds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Play is in laps" means that to take your turn, you lift all the seeds in 
any hole on your side and drop them one at a time in each hole counter-
clockwise. This is called sowing. If the last seed lands in ANY nonempty 
hole on either side of the board, you lift up all the seeds from this hole 
and continue sowing. This continues until the last seed from any lap lands 
in an empty hole. Games of this type are called 'multilap games' as opposed
to wari which is a single lap game.


On page 43-44, he gives the rules to another multilap mancala game called 
bao played on a 2x7 board with 4 seeds per hole. He repeats that bao is a 
generic name for many mancala games in this part of Africa (Tanzania).


On pages 96-100, Mr. Russ reprints a pamphlet from the National Museum 
of Tanzania called "How to Play Bao."  He says it is the most complex game
in his book. The game is played on 4x8 hole board with a total of 64 seeds.
This is probably the game you're looking for. It's longer than I feel like
retyping at the moment and it isn't that clearly written. The same game is
described in Murray's book, but some of the details and native terms
are different. Russ's version is more recent and probably more accurate, 
but I already type in Murray's version and my fingers are tired! 



 From <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>A History of Board Games Other Than Chess<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, by 
H.J.R. Murray:

Here are all the mancala games whose name is or 
includes the word BAO that are described in Murray's 
book. 

I've included only the rules and whatever else is needed 
to understand the rules. The last one, 8.3.11 BAO 
KISWAHILI is the closest to what you asked for. It is 
very complicated. The same game is described in Russ's 
book -- that description is taken verbatim from a pamphlet 
from the National Museum of Tanzania called "How to 
play Bao". The rules and some of the terms differ to 
some degree, but that version is most likely more 
current.

(a) Games with captures removed from the board

These games only differ in their initial arrays and in 
the rules regarding captures. Singletons [a lone seed] 
can only be moved when the player has no loaded hole 
[hole with two or more seeds] and then only to an empty 
hole. Moves may begin from any loaded hole and a move 
may consist of several laps. The move ends when the 
last bean in hand is sown in an empty hole. I classify 
the games by the method of capture.

First form of capture: When a player's last bean in 
hand is sown in an empty hole on his front row, and his 
opponent's opposite front-row hole in the same file 
contains beans, or both of his opponent's opposite 
holes, front and back row, contain beans, these are 
taken.

8.2.1 Zanzibar:  BAO KIARABU, ARABIAN BAO or KIARABU
4x7 holes and two stores. Two beans in each hole. 
Several laps to the move, one round, play only 
anticlockwise.

A move may start from any loaded hole on the player's 
rows. If the last bean in hand is sown in a hole 
containing beans, these are lifted for a new lap; if in 
an empty hole in his front row and the opponent's 
opposite front-row hole contains beans, these are 
taken. If the opponent's opposite back-row hole also 
contains, beans, these are taken as well.


8.2.2 Zanzibar:  BAO KIARABU or KIARABU
4x8 holes and two stores. Three beans in each hole. 
Several laps to the move; one round; play either 
clockwise or anticlockwise.

A move may begin from any loaded hole on the player's 
rows. If the last bean in hand is sown in a hole 
containing beans, these are lifted for a new lap; if in 
an empty hole the move ends, and the player takes the 
contents of either or both the opponent's opposite 
holes.


(b) Games with re-entry of captures

All the games are normally played on a board of 4x8 
holes without stores by two players, each of whom has 
thirty-two beans, though occasionally larger boards and 
more beans may be used.

The game is to capture or immobilize all the opposing 
beans. In some, but not in all of the games, the game 
is also won if one player in one turn of play takes all 
his opponent's beans in the two end-holes of his front 
row.

The main difference between the various games are:

1. The discrimination of certain holes, usually either 
A, P, a, p or A, B, O, P, a, b, o, p, which, I call 
reverse holes. Beans in a reverse hole may be lifted 
and sown clockwise, if by so doing a capture can be 
made.

  Note from Edward: The holes are named like this:


     h g f e d c b a
     i j k l m n o p
     P O N M L K J I
     A B C D E F G H

2. The conditions governing captures. These involve the 
definition of holes in opposition. Beans can only be 
taken when they occupy holes in opposition.

3. The rules for the re-entry of captures.

4. The opening play.


The following rules are common to all the games:

1. The game is played on one round, and a move may 
consist of several laps.

2. No singleton can begin a move or lap or make a 
capture. It follows that a player who is reduced to 
singletons is unable to move and loses the games.

3. A move may begin from any loaded hole on the 
player's side of the board. If this hole is a reverse 
hole, the move may be made anticlockwise or clockwise, 
but only clockwise to effect a capture. If it is not a 
reverse hole, it can only be made anticlockwise. If the 
last bean in hand falls in an empty hole, the lap and 
move end and the opponent plays; if in a hole which 
contains one or more beans, and is not in opposition as 
defined for the game being played, the lap ends and a 
new lap is begun by lifting the contents of this hole 
and sowing them in the usual way. Further laps may 
follow until the last bean in hand falls in an empty 
hole or a front-row hole from which the rules permit a 
capture. Captures are then re-entered in accordance 
with the special rules of each game, and the new lap so 
initiated is played like other laps.

[Note from Edward. Each player only sows into his or 
her own holes. Top player uses a-p, bottom player A-P.]

8.3.11 BAO KISWAHILI, BAO, BAU. 4x8 holes (kishima, 
plural vishimo) and one store (kichwa, head) at one end 
of the board. Two holes , L and l, are square, and 
known as `villages' (mji, musi) or kuu, `big', and 
special rules govern their use. The remaining holes are 
round. Two players, each with thirty-two beans (komwe 
or soo). One round; several laps to the move; play 
sometimes anticlockwise and sometimes clockwise.

The players' front rows are mbele, `in front' and their 
back rows are nyuma, `behind'. The eight holes in each 
player's front row consist of four <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>reverse holes<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> two 
at each end of he row (I, J, O, P, i, j, o, p) and four 
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>optional holes<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> in the middle of the row (K, L, M, N, 
k, l, m, n). Two front-row holes on the same file are 
said to be in opposition when both are occupied.

_Initial arrangement._ Each player arranges ten beans 
on his front row, putting six in L (l), two in J (j) 
and two in K (k). Each player retains in hand twenty-
two beans which are known as namu.

The play may now be divided into three sections: the 
opening play, leading up to the array which is favored 
by the player, during which the rules of move may be 
varied; the middle game (kunamua) during which the 
beans in hand (namu) are entered; and the end game 
(mtaji) after all the beans in hand have been entered 
on the board. If the players have no array that they 
favour more than any other, the opening play may be 
omitted.

_Opening Play._ The beans are arranged initially as 
given above, and each player makes one move, during 
which the rules of the game may be disregarded. 
[Following is an example. Epj]  X enters a namu in K, 
making its contents three beans which he lifts and sows 
anticlockwise in L, M, and N, and his opening move 
ends. N and k, M and l are now in opposition. Y enters 
a namu in k, takes the bean in opposition in N and adds 
it to his three beans in k. (Here the rules are 
disregarded. N is an optional hole, and beans taken 
from an optional hole should be entered in a front-row 
end-hole, I or p.) He the lifts 4k [the four beans in 
K. Epj] and sows them anticlockwise in l, m, n, o, 
producing the position:

            Y
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     0 2 0 7 1 1 1 0
     0 0 0 1 7 0 2 0
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
            X

in which J and o, L and m, M and l are in opposition.

_Middle game._ Each player has now twenty-one beans in 
hand, and each turn of play is begun by entering a namu 
in a hole on the player's front row which already 
contains at least one bean, and if the player has any 
holes in opposition, one of these must be chosen, and 
the contents of the opposite hole are captured. This 
opposite hole is necessarily either a reverse or an 
optional hole. If it is a reverse hole, the captured 
beans are sown from the same end of the front row, e.g. 
if the captured beans were taken in o or p, they are 
re-entered in I and sown towards the middle of the 
board, and if they were taken from I or j, the re-entry 
is in P and they also are sown towards the middle of 
the board. If the capture was made from an optional 
hole, the re-entry may be made from either end-hole of 
the front row, and if more than one bean was taken, 
they are sown from either end of the row towards the 
middle of the board. If there are no holes in 
opposition in the front row, the namu is entered in any 
front-row hole containing one or more beans, and the 
beans in this hole are then lifted and sown in either 
direction. If all the player's front-row holes except 
the village (L, l) are empty and the village is not in 
opposition, the namu may be entered in it, but only two 
beans may be lifted from it for sowing.

If the last bean of a sowing, whether of captures or of 
a lap. Ends in a hole in opposition, a fresh capture is 
made and the captured beans are treated as above; if it 
is sown in an occupied hole, other than the village, 
the contents of that hole are lifted for a new lap; if 
it ends in the village and the village is not in 
opposition, or if no beans have previously been removed 
from the village, the player has the option of ending 
his move without lifting the contents of the village 
for a new lap; if the last bean in hand is sown in an 
empty hole, the move ends.

_End game._ Moves may begin from any loaded hole in 
either the fromt or back row. The contents of the hole 
may be sown in either direction. If the last bean in 
hand when sowing a lap does not fall in a hole in 
opposition, no captures can be made in that turn of 
play although further laps may be played.

A player loses the game if all his front-row holes are 
empty or if his front-row only contains singletons.

I've proofed this rather quickly. Please forgive any typos.
