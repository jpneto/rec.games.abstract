I am thinking of organising a game of Nomic, and I wondered if
anyone had any experience of playing this, and how it worked out.
What is a good number of players? Do you have any suggestions for
initial rules other than the standard set? That sort of thing.

And if you're interested in eNomic, well, there's a Game going on already!
Yes, that's right! As the Benevolent, Mighty Speaker of the eNomic Game

approved in Rule 357), we wish to welcome you, if you would like to play.
To register, simply email ourself at '<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:wesc@ichips.intel.com">wesc@ichips.intel.com</a>' or even at
'<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:wesc@agora.rain.com">wesc@agora.rain.com</a>' now. :) Or both for fastest response. The listsev for
the eNomic Game is at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au">nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au</a> if you would simply like
to watch for a short time before joining. 

If you are interested in simply playing a "live" Game, we are just now
finishing an Initial Rule Set which we believe to be fairly good, and could
use some extra input. If you woule like us to email this to you, please let
us know. Enjoy!

The Omnilaborant and Overworked Speaker
