Are these the rules of Hex?

The board is rhomboidal, made up of hexagonally tiled spaces, N
hexagons to a side.  Two opposite edges of the board are colored red,
and the other pair are colored blue.  The first player puts a red
token in a space; the second player then decides whether he or his
opponent will be the red player.  Thereafter, starting with the blue
player, the players take turns placing a single token of their color
in an unoccupied hexagonal space.  When all the hexagonal spaces are
filled with tokens, exactly one of these statements is true: a chain
of red tokens links the two red sides, or a chain of blue tokens links
the two blue sides.  Whichever player finds his colors' sides
connected is the winner.  (Note that Hex is a family of games, that
varies based on the value of N in the first sentence.)

So far so good?

I'd like to introduce three families of games that I'm making up on
the spot, some of which I'd consider to be generalizations of Hex that
are not encompassed by Atoll.  Please let the group know if you'd
consider them to be generalizations of Hex, if you'd consider them
encompassed by Atoll, and why or why not.  (These examples are very
simplistic, so you may be inclined to dismiss me as a smart-ass, but I
hope you'll give thoughtful answers.)

The first, "Colorful Hex", is very much like Hex as described above.
However, the first player first chooses his favorite color in the
world, and it replaces "red" in the rules above.  The second player
then chooses a distinct color, and it replaces "blue".  The players
use those colors instead of the standard colors for the rest of the
game.  When players pick "red" and "blue", this family is exactly like
Hex.

The second, "Super Pie-Rule Hex", is very much like Hex as described
above.  However, we replace the first clause of the third sentence
above with this one: "The first player places K red tokens and J blue
tokens in distinct spaces; ..."  When K=1 and J=0, this family is
exactly like Hex.

The third, "Horrible Luck Hex", is also very much like Hex as
described above.  However, the fourth sentence is a little different.
Instead of placing a token where he likes on his turn, a player must
declare where he wants to place his token, then roll an X-sided die Y
times and sum the results.  If the total is at least Z, then he is
allowed to place his token.  Otherwise, he must leave the space empty.
When X=1, Y=6, and Z=1, this family is exactly like Hex.
