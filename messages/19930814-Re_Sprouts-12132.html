  Does anyone have a copy of the rules for sprouts? I can't seem to quite
remember all the details, not that there are that many, mind you. :)
  Also, does anyone have a table of which player wins when you start with
x many dots? Thanks a lot. Enjoy!

The rules for Sprouts are as follows:

You can start with any number of dots, but a starting number of more than
five makes a long and drawn-out game, too long to get the math down in order
to win every time.  Three- and Four-dot sprouts is fine, and easier to
master, although unfortunately, I can offer no advice to their mastery.
Martin Gardner covers "Sprouts" pretty well in his book MATHEMATICAL CARNIVAL.

Anyway, you draw the dots.  Their positioning is totally immaterial to the
game.  Then you decide who goes first.  I'm not sure whether or not mastery
of SPROUTS is totally dependent on who plays first... I think you can learn
how to win in both cases.

In each turn, a player MUST do EACH of the following TWO THINGS.


	First:  Connect two of the dots with any kind of line, straight or
		curvy or whatever.  You may connect a dot to itself.

	Second:	Draw a new dot on the new line.

There are only two rules to the game.

	Rule #1:	Lines may not cross or touch each other.

	Rule #2:	(and this is the catch)
			NO MORE THAN THREE BRANCHES, or "SPROUTS", MAY
			COME OUT OF ANY DOT.


For example, when a dot is connected to itself, the action produces two
sprouts through that dot.  The dot which is then placed on that line
automatically has two sprouts coming out of it, one on each side.  That 
means that only one more line may be drawn from that dot.  It also means
that the new dot may NOT be connected to itself, because that would make
four sprouts out of that dot.

Play continues until one player cannot make a legal move.  That player then
loses the game, and proceeds to set him or her self on fire.

Have fun!  Look to Martin Gardener for strategy tips.
