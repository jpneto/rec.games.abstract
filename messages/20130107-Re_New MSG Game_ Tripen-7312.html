It's funny, you don't seem real concerned about what you've told me privately over the years, Corey.  You want to stockpile high powered weapons for the purpose of "annihilating" people, and the only thing stopping you is you can't afford them.  Maybe it's a good thing you're a lowlife, so nobody has to get annihilated by you.  

If your girlfriend has an abortion, they'll find her "in a bag upstream".  Lovely.

You became aroused by the site and smell of a rotting dog carcass.  That was about the most fucked up thing I ever heard.  I don't know if you realize this, Corey, but you're a sick pup.  It goes beyond aspergers.  Way beyond..

You found the Marvin Spellbinder pic "awesome".  All that proves is that you're a hypocrite since you protested it publicly.  You always say you couldn't care less what people think of you.  Apparently you do.
