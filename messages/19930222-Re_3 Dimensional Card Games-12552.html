Hi folks,

this is just a thought that crossed my mind this morning - the shower is a
really creative place.

I was thinking about card games and realized, that all (at least the ones I
know) card decks are two dimensional (value x suit or colour).
Has anyone ever thought of a three (or even four, five - well, I could go
on like this for quite a while...) dimensional card deck? The obvious (?)
design I came up with was: 
	VALUE x COLOUR x SIZE
If you give each dimension four possible values, you get 64 different cards, 
which looks like a nice deck-size to me.

Now, that we have the design - or at least a first attempt - we have to
find an application for it. Everything I could come up with up to now, is
very mechanical (i.e. boring :( ) so all comments on this thought would be
greatly appreciated.

Actually, there has been a lot of work on doing odd things with cards.
Size is a bad variable since it is rather has to keep secret (which is
often the point of cards, eh?  Uniform back with differentiated fronts)

SET is the one to the forefront now because the MENSA people drooled all
over it.  (it's actually not so much of a game as an exercise in pattern
recognition)
