Hi Nate, good to hear from you.  I wish I could design a game, but several obstacles.  No time due to working on another hobby.  Burned out on game design.  In a game design rut like everyone else.  I'm in an Oust/Tanbo rut and can't get out.  Luis is in a connection game rut.  I hate to poo poo the little activity there is here, but I'd like to see people break out of their ruts.

What game I'd like to have is a Checkers/stacking game where the board starts out empty and players take turns adding checkers of their own color to the board.  Stacks of no more than 4 form.  Of course it has to be finite.  But I just want it to be like snow falling down.  Like in Go.  No movement, just placement, one stone per turn.  Capturing would be awesome, but it has to remain finite.

Has to be simple and easy to explain.  There are always big checker tables at coffee shops and I'd like to be able to play there and easily explain the rules to onlookers.  It has to be organic and fun.  And visually dramatic..  And...
