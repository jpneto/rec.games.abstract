With perfect play, every

How stupid of me ...

Ok, I thought about it.
Your first proposition is right, generally speaking. I didn't say "no
other mechanism I know has this feature" as a page filler though.

I'm not going to explain Symple again - it isn't called Symple for
nothing:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/symple-572">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/symple-572</a>

A very rough indicator for the moment that growing all groups becomes
more efficient than placing a single stone is the speed with which
half the board can be filled by a single player, and that's about the
square root of that area. For a 19x19 board that's the square root of
180 or ~ move 13/14.

Around that time black's prerogative renders as much advantage as
white would have on the first move, if black would not have this
prerogative.

So somewhere in between there's a balance point. <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Both<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> players can
decide to end black's prerogative at any point in between, making the
mechanism a "trajectory pie" that can only converge to this balance
point.

Now you think about it.
