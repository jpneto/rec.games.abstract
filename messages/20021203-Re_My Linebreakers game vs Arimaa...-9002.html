As for Arimaa, I've come to perceive the board and the pieces
a bit like the naive representation of gravity in general
relativity, you know, the rubber film with the marbles that
make hollows.

Okay, please keep the discussion on Earth, I had to get up at 9 and I can't
wrap my head around hollows in rubber film made by marbles.  I could
probably wrap rubber film around my head, though.  Your point about internal
adaptations within the engine is well-taken, but my experience of such
things (limited though it is) is that even seemingly minute changes in the
rules specification can result in amplified differences in gameplay.  No, I
can't give any examples (nor do I imagine you'd need any), I have been
retired for many years, and I am quite rusty.  I expect you to humor me on
this one.
