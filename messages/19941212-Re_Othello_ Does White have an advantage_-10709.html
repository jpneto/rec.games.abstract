Re: who holds the advantage in Othello
 
Well, the game really starts with white making the "second" move--there's only
one "first" move up to symmetry.  The strategy is generally avoiding bad 
(forced) moves, so black, having had to make an extra forced move at the 
beginning, would seem to be at a disadvantage.  Black is also more likely to 
have to move first outside the 4x4 center, or into a corner 2x2 region.  White
easily wins 4x4 Othello (11-5) by taking a corner right away and then getting 
black to make a forced move; does anyone know 6x6 Othello?  These are all 
"evidence" (if not proof) that the second player has an advantage.  Isn't the
usual "equalization" to play a pair of games and add up the tallys?

p.s. who plays the last move is determined by who wins the (middle) game.
p.p.s. the 12/92 Waterloo tournament doesn't seem all that strong--blunders
giving away corners are readily apparent.
