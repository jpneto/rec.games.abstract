I think I've decided on NMM at this point.  The main reason, really, is
that I like it better than the other games (well, except maybe
backgammon).  But I also like the fact that NMM, like chess and
checkers, dates back to antiquity:  though the modern versions of each
game may be traceable to a particular time and place, their roots
extend back into the unknown past.  Another piece of my rationale:  NMM
is related to tic-tac-toe (noughts &amp; crosses), which means all three of
these games were at least somewhat familiar to me when I was a child.
So they're linked to my own past as well as the world's past.

Of course there are variations on Morris to try as well. We like to
play 12-man, which adds diagonal lines linking the corners of the board
and apparently dates to the 1400's, although it means there is a
possibility of a stalemate if no one makes a mill in the first phase of
the game since the pieces can totally fill the board.

There's also supposed to be a Somali version that is also played with
12 men each where you do NOT take pieces if you make a mill during the
first phase of the game. Once all the pieces are on the board the first
person to make a mill gets to remove an opposing piece to create an
opening to begin the sliding phase. The description we found did not
specifiy, but we assumed that if your opponent is blocked from moving
it's not a win, they just lose a turn until they have an open space to
make a move. (Which is the way we play 12-man Morris since with more
pieces, blocking in your opponent happens more often)
