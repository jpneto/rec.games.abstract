Help me out here, Christian.  You were a high school teacher.  There had to be that occasional lost looking loner (giving you a boner) with a butt you could bounce a dime off.  You probably had to strap your giant dick to your leg with a belt.  I wish I still had that pic of Christian in a speedo.  He just about put Martin Spellbinder to shame.

Now you're backpedalling, and no one should know better than you how that turns out. Your old story was that you were goofing on me. Now these girls were high-school age. 12 isn't highschool age, its practically prepubescent you sick fuck.

I remember because you told me at the time you were taking a screen shot of the conversation.  I laughed at you then and I laugh at you now.

Haha if I told you that you would have doubtless created some expose about how I was blackmailing you. Mark you're way too much of a dumbfuck to create a believable lie, the truth is probably a little more your speed so hug it as tightly as possible.

Dude, you said you were turned on by a dead dog.  I'll never forget that as long as I live.  Stop lying about it.

Lets just analyze the logic (or lack thereof) here. Under what circumstances would I mention on iggc that the decaying corpse of an animal aroused me? I don't exactly see a segue to such a conversation. Perhaps you could try to bolster that lie a little chief to at least create the illusion that you are trying. I mean as if I would ever tell you anything private Mark. You're an unhinged, unpredictable sociopathic fuck with mommy issues. I can assure you anything I have ever told you I would openly admit anywhere else on the internet. And unlike your retarded ass I don't consider iggc a place to hold private conversations. You're not my fucking confidant Mark, you've only been a thorn in my side providing variable degrees of discomfort.

Oh Chriost, stop whining about being in the 99%.  Holy shit that's nauseating.  Like I'm supposed to feel sorry for you.  If life is so fucking miserable, toss yourself off a fucking parking structure.

You've totally missed the point (unsurprisingly). I'm not whining about being in the 99%, which as a protest group is full of Marxist freaks of all manner. I'm merely commenting on how people who experience excessive levels of privilege turn into you, a regressive, demented manchild with the emotional complexity of a gnat. I would never make the error of thinking you could feel sorry for anyone, ever.

Same goes for Rhesus monkeys from what I here.

Who are you trying to kid Mark? You're the easiest person in the world to outrage. You're the kind of guy who pulls to the shoulder of a road and brandishes a tire iron because someone gave him the finger. This is going to be a fucking cakewalk for me.
