[Interesting background on Minski snipped.]

Although Smith could not be expected to be aware of this in 1982 when he
published his excellent book, <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Curse Of Mornington Crescent<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, he does
have an excellent chapter on "Mornington Crescent and Psychosis", that may
offer insights about Minski.  Smith posits a relationship between the
intense study of Mornington Crescent and the early onset of pschyotic
delusions.  He argues that the serious study of Mornington Crescent has in
some cases led to mental disorders, in particular those with delusional
symptoms.  Unfortunately he only documents five study cases, but cites the
work of several psychiatrists, including the highly respected Dr. Kent
Armstrong and Dr. Yuraj Singh.  I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Singh at a
recent Mornington Crescent Convention in Delhi, India, and he made mention
of ongoing research in England that appears to support the thesis of a
definite relationship between Mornington Crescent and psychotic delusions,
which may well explain why so many excellent players are retiring at such a
young age.  I would love to hear from others who are more familiar with this
research, and whether these claims have any credibility.

I think "excellent" is an adjective that can rarely have been applied to 
Smith's work, on Mornington Crescent or the other subjects of his 
popular histories.  I will grant that he was better than many in the 
field, and actually did research when he could - but he never let lack 
of research hinder publication!

I recall a Christmas Lecture by Dr. Humphrey Nagle [I think 1998, but it 
could be as late as 2000] in which he did a sort of retrospective on 
Smith, and was quite scathing about some of the early material.  As he 
put it [I quote from memory] "Some of the Egyptian gods mentioned by 
Smith, such as the Crocodile god Ghobla, or Pniht the Small-Headed god, 
would be more at home in the 'Discworld' of Mr. Terry Pratchett, than in 
the Ptolemaic Pantheon."  Pratchett was not perhaps so well-known at the 
time, and the reference went over the head of many - but for those who 
were familiar with his stories, it was very amusing!  Dr. Nagle also 
discerned similarities between Smith's Egyptian chapter and some of the 
works of Erik Von Daniken...

That said, Smith's excursions into post-medieval history are more useful 
and often contain material not found elsewhere, and Dr. Nagle did not 
dispute this.

As for the chapter on psychosis, I'm not really convinced by any of this 
sort of stuff.  Playing any difficult game at a high level is going to 
require a mentality that is more obsessive than the norm, but if 
anything I should say that this will mitigate any underlying psychotic 
tendencies rather than exacerbate them.  Minski doesn't count in any 
case, IMO, because although an inspired mathematician capable of great 
feats of analysis, he was never more than a strong club player (if even 
that) in actual play.

Honestly, I would place this sort of thing with Reuben Fine's monograph 
on the psychology of Mornington Crescent, which if anything is even more 
wrong-headed and offensive than his similarly Freudian extrapolations 
regarding Chess.
