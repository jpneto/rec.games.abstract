Sapos (frogs in Spanish) is a game for 2 players


Materials
8x8 board
32 pieces in two colors, 16 pieces of one color, and 16 pieces of another color

Object
Player last to move wins.

Setup
The game is played on the spaces of an 8x8 board that starts out with 4 pieces of one color placed on the points d2, d3,e2,e3 and 4 pieces of another color are placed on d6,d7,e6,e7. The remaining 24 pieces are held in a player's respective reserves.

Play
Choose a player to move first and then the second player will move twice only on her first turn, thereafter turns alternate.

Each turn a player must make one or more jumps with one of his pieces.

Each jump must be in an orthogonal direction over one friendly or enemy piece into a vacant space directly after the jumped piece. The jumping piece may change direction between jumps.

Clarifications
An enemy piece is removed from the board immediately after a jump and returned to the owner's reserve.

You may not add a piece from your reserve if on the same turn you have captured an enemy piece

If no enemy pieces are jumped, a piece from a playerâ€™s reserve is placed in a vacant orthogonal adjacent space to the final position of the jumping piece.

End of game
The game ends when a player is unable to take his turn.
