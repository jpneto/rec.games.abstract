Hello,

actually any board in which you

a. place pieces on a board, but do not move them from one
square/intersection to another
b. don't capture

can be played as a "paper &amp; pencil" game.

Nice examples:

Hex, Y, Renju.

Some paper &amp; pencil games can well be played on a board. Imagine
Schmittberger's Octagon with colored tiles! How beautiful!

I discovered/invented  a few games in my life such as:

1. "Pantherk�stchen" (German Dots &amp; Boxes or "K�sek�stchen" for advanced
players)
2. "Netak" (a card game which is played on an imaginary board with one to
possibly more than  100 players. Some games took months to complete. A pure
game of skill deeper than Go or Chess).
3. Magnetgo (internationally known as "electric Go", -- i was quite
astonished when i learned that there were Magnetgo tournaments in the USA
and at the European Go Congress)
4. "Dornr�schendame" ("Sleeping Beauty Draughts"; a nice Draughts variant
that cannot end in a draw)
5. "Walking Purchase" (named in honor of the Lenape nation)


Today I want to introduce to you

"Pantherk�stchen".


I invented the game when i was about 8 years old, still a little Panther,
30 years ago. The game is public domain and nobody is allowed to copyright
it!

I believed that it is a rather easy game, but recently I learned that "Dots
&amp; Boxes" is a difficult game, at least this is claimed by some of the most
talented game theorists.

German Dots and Boxes appears to be played differently from the MSRI variant
as described in "Games of no Chance" edited by Richard Nowakowski.

Called "K�sek�stchen" in German ("little cheese squares"), German kids draw
the edges of a rectangle on a paper sheet (with squares). There is no fixed
size, the "board can well number over 200 squares.
This pre-drawn edge later becomes part of the squares conquered by the
individual player (usually this is a two players game).

"Pantherk�stchen" ("little Panther squares") differs not much from this
traditional German children's game:

While in the traditional game each player draws an orthogonal  line which is
exactly as long as the side of a square, in Pantherk�stchen players draw
straight orthogonal lines that are exactly two sides long (use the same
pencil). Your goal is still to surround a single square of the lattice with
lines, which you then claim as your own (mark them with a dot or a cross).
If you surround a square or several single squares at once, you can
immediatly draw another straight line (always two sides long!) and continue
as long as you conquer squares each time. Each turn ends with a line which
doesn't conquer squares (except the very last move in the game). You must
move. The player who conquers most squares wins. Capturing (i.e. claiming
squares) is not compulsory. At the end of the game you also have neutral
squares: squares which are not and cannot completely surrounded. The game is
only meant to be played by extremely intelligent kids (sort of a joke :-)) ,
so try this game on a very large board. I consider 25x25=625 squares as the
standard size (this is not one of these ugly capitalist games for hunted
people who never have enough time!). The conquered squares are considered to
be "land" owned by a player, while the squares are interpreted as "water"
(lakes, ocean) which doesn't belong to any player.

This is a nice territory game and would surely be a cute  challenge for game
theorists...
