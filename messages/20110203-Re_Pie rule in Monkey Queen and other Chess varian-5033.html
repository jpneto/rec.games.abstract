The pie rule ruins Monkey Queen according to one guy,
who happens to be a good Shogi and Chess variants
(and Monkey Queen) player.  The theory is that the pie
rule prevents White (Player 1) from "exploring the depth
of the game".

I disagree because a branch of a game tree is a sub-tree in itself.
You get a lot of extra insight in one specific initial position
because it gets investigated frequently and thoroughly. Such depth, in
absolute terms, can not easily be developed if there's an array of
opening options. But from a singular starting point you soon run into
an array of opening positions too. And their diversity doen't prevent
you from "exploring the depth of the game".

The discussion is rooted in what you would call "the game". If "Chess-
as-is" is meant, yes then other initial positions will prevent you
from exploring the depth of "the game".

Chess-960 bears testimony to Fischer getting fed up with "the game".
The idea in itself wasn't that bad. Only thing was, Fischer considered
castling not as a means to an end, but an end in itself. One can be
brilliant and nuts at the same time, as Fischer has shown on more than
one occasion. Chess-960 is Weird Shuffle Chess.

Of course.  My point was not to create a grudge over first move advantage
deluged games, but rather to stimulate a discussion about what impact the
pie rule has on simple Chess variants like Monkey Queen.

The question would be the one you've asked several times yourself: are
there bad first moves? That may differ from game to game, but
generally speaking there may be something of a shortage there.
