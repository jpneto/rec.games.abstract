WARNING: Soporific digression coming.

One related thought. I've learned that the concept of 'legitimity' is
key in game design: in an ideal game, you should be able to justify
every rule with a corresponding added dimension of the playing
experience. This is not the case with rules aimed only at correcting
technical flaws in the game as a logical device: superko, for example,
prevents the logical aberration of cycles, but doesn't add to the
pleasure of finding the best move in a position (quite the opposite,
in fact). The challenge, in those cases, is finding a rule which
corrects the flaw as if unwittingly, because of its side effects on
game play being more noteworthy. That's what Christian achieved with
Sygo; Goncrete is halfway there, which is already an improvement. If
one of those games can prove that their game play is just as good as
that of Go, the burden of superko will be enough to tip the balance.

Note that 'legitimate' is not the same as 'intrinsic', which I would
define as 'naturally arising from the character of the accompanying
rules'. Intrisic rules are almost transparent. They don't look like
rules in themselves, but rather simple consequences of other rules.
Superko can be more or less intrinsic, but it can't be legitimate. The
castling move in chess is legitimate, but never intrinsic. A rule is
made legitimate when it has won credibility as a helpful means to
improve the game's tactics or strategy and hence the pleasure one can
expect from playing it. In an ideal game, every rule should be
legitimate, and most rules should be intrinsic.

'Legitimate' would have to do with architecture, e.g. the architecture
of an acyclic game whose rules don't seem directed to prevent cycles.
'Intrinsic' would have to do with elegance, e.g. the elegance of a
game where you feel completely free in spite of the ever repressive
rules... but less repressive because they're intrinsic.
