This is great news to me!
I'm new to this newsgroup (and to the Internet in general),
and I started reading this group yesterday after a tip from
a friend of my, Dan Garcia.
Some time ago, I programmed a version of Abalone for the Macintosh.
The program is available via anonymous FTP, at sumex-aim and
at mac.archive. It is freeware, feel free to download it.
The program IS Macintosh-specific and does, of course, not know
about the move notation format described in your article.
I have three questions, and one remark:

Q: Why do you want to include both the head and the tail in
your notation for line/push moves? this is implicit by the rules!

Q: Does the program HAVE to support the notational convention
you described (and how would this work, with a text file exchanged
between the programs or differently?), or is it OK to just submit
a program with a decent graphical interface as well?

Q: Is a Macintosh in your eyes a 'normal' computer, and if so,
how powerful a Mac would you use to run the program on?

R: The Macintosh program I made can relatively easy be used to
incorporate new strategies. (This would mean implementing the 
strategy in C as a "BoardJudgeProc", a function with the board,
the current player and the recursion level as input, and a numeric
value as the result, put it in the source and recompile; a standard
minimax strategy is used to find the move the BoardJudgeProc
thinks best. The program in is written in MPW C. Three strategies
are currently included, so it should be relatively easy to get
started, provided you have a Mac and MPW or Think C.)
If anyone is interested in the source code for the program, please
let me know. The program I posted on the net is just the program
(not the source code) and I put a copyright notice in it.
I'm willing to give the source code to anyone interested in it,
provided it's for use in this tournament, not to make a shareware
or commercial version of the program.
I think this competition is a nice idea, and I probably will join it,
if I can find the time to update the program to support you notation
(if I have to).
