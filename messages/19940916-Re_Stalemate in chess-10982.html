I would personally suggest a modification of the old Lasker system, awarding
3/4 to a player who gives stalemate and 1/4 to the stalemated player. (In
draws-not-counting matches, it would be half a win.)

I think that's a good idea. Just as good would be to either count a stalemate
as a win for the player giving it, as a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>loss<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for the player giving it or
as in so many other versions of chess to just <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>not allow<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a move that gives
stalemate! I'll give details in a separate post.

No one's ever accused me of being a chess traditionalist (I usually only play a
variant I invented myself, which regular chessplayers claim is unrecognizable
as chess or at least very unchesslike).

This has nothing to do with the bulk of this article, but could you post or
email me the rules for your variant?

    Still, this is why I support the STATUS QUO:

    1) The thrill goes out of the game when you give all power to the 
predator (the player with a temporary or permanent advantage). No more 
chance of the rabbit eluding the fox, etc. No incentive for the behind 
player to do anything but resign <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Yawn<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> -- more boring to me by far than 
some wily player forcing a stalemate ... 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Fine. When you play, use the draw rules as is. But this arguement has nothing
to do with the real world. Just by looking around at the 1000's of other 
games, sports and competitions the humans participate in you can see that you
are alone on this point. Oh, we all <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>root<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for the underdog, but there are 
no rules allowing a lapped 1000 kilometer swimmer to eke out a draw! (I'm
1/4 of a mile behind -- gee this is boring -- maybe I can swim into her lane
and disqualify us both!) Give me one counter-example. And checkers doesn't
count. That game as <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>drawn<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> it self into near non-existance -- though I 
suppose you find it exciting to watch the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>wily<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> players force each other 
into one draw after another.

And if you're that far behind on material, hurry up and resign and start the
next game.

2) But that's not all. What if you are mass ahead and are the only player
who can possibly mate. I assume you want to push it in the direction of
rewarding the strong player (Like I said, I don't care to, necessarily). 
Well, what if I can stalemate you somehow? 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

What if? So what? You're talking about a rare situation. Who cares? What if
you can checkmate me somehow? You win, that's what. What is the problem?
No one said that changing the rules wouldn't change the game. Personally, I
think that when a game stops evolving, it is dead. That's part of the idea.
Changing the game opens up new ideas, new directions and new possibilities.

Plenty of games are won while behind on material.

3) Just as we now have a class of stalemate, perpetual check, etc. players
who are hell on D and hard to mate, we would get a new breed of "play for the
stalemate" players who would specialize in 3/4 win nickel-and diming you to
death. Matches might be draws and stalemates and the (very rare) occasional
win. Sound exciting??? 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Is a TKO less exciting than a KO? What about a split decision? The majority 
of the 'spectators' in chess watch by reading the scores in the paper. 
For myself, Whozits beating Whatzits 11 wins to 10 wins with 3 draws is 
more exciting than 2 wins to 1 with 21 draws. 
                                  
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
4) Also, why not a win for the one who can give perpetual check? This
causes far more draws, I bet, than stalemate. Or this combined with ways of
forcing repetition by 3-time position rule, which to me is a variant of
perpetual check. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't know, why not? Or why not just not allow perpetual check. If GO did
not have the ko-fight rule, that game would cease to exist.

5) And <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> major cause of draws is probably simple positional/material
equality at the end where good play by both will <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> let one player win.
If you really want to get rid of draws, why not give the player with name A-M
the point on even numbered days and the player with name N-Z on odd days, the
point for winning the game?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I know you intended sarcasm but that kind of stuff is happening already. I
INTEL speed chess tourney they used a 6 minutes for white vs 5 minutes for
black tiebreak. White must win -- any draw counts as a win for black. Black
nearly always gets the point. So the results were being determined by a coin
toss. Better to eleminate as many draws as possible so that tiebreaks are less
needed. Of course, assigning different point values to the various possible
results would make ties even less likely.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
6) Also, I like games where draws are possible. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No one says you can't play chess with the rules as is. We don't use the
designated hitter rule in our softball league. But neither of us is playing
for the world title, and no one is $ponsering our event with zillions of 
dollars.

Think of why Rocky was a good movie ... he went the distance, not 
vanquished the champ like some fairytale character.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

But Rocky IS a fairytale character! And if you'll recall, he lost the fight!
Not a draw. A clean loss.

The main point of this rebuttal is that I believe that the less likely we
can make ANY TYPE draw in chess, the better the game will be, and regardless
of whether the rules of the game are altered somewhat or just the scoring 
is changed, Kasparov will still be the champ. The world standings will 
most likely be unchanged. But there MAY be more interest in major chess
events by the lay press that MAY contribute to the overall welfare of the
game. Just my opinion with nothing but unscientific anecdotal evidence to 
back me up, but I think the public hates draws and games and sports that
end in draw to often are mocked.

I'll go into annoying detail in a separate post.
