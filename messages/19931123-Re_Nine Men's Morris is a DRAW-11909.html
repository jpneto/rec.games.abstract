The game of Nine Men's Morris (NMM) has been solved. The game is a draw.

As there are different variations of NMM being played, I will first specify
the rules I used, then give a short summary of how the solution was computed.

Could you tell me how a draw is defined in this game?
Unless I'm missing something, it sounds like these losing
conditions preclude a draw.  That is, if I am the first
player who can't make a move on his turn, then it looks like
I lose regardless of whether or not the other player now
has moves remaining.  And if I am correct in inferring that
there are never times when two players remove stones at the
same time, then only one player can go from 4 to 3 stones at one
time, thus losing regardless of the status of the other player.

My only thought was that the game becomes a draw when both
players can continue making cyclical moves that will never
cause either of the losing conditions.  Is that right?

HOW IT WAS SOLVED
-----------------

Retrograde Analysis (well known from Chess) was used to compute
databases for all mid- and endgame positions (about 10 billion
different positions). These positions were split into 28
separate databases characterized by the number of stones on the
board i.e. all the 3 White stone against 3 Black stone
positions, the 4-3, 4-4 ... up to 9-9 positions.

An 18 ply alpha-beta search for the opening phase then found
the value of the initial position (the empty board). Only the
9-9, 9-8 and 8-8 databases were needed to establish that the
game is a draw.

Was the "optimal strategy" discovered that would guarantee
playing to the draw that was discovered?  I imagine it would
be some sort of symmetic play on the part of the 2nd player,
or something like that...?
