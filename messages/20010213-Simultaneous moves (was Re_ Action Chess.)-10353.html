Just last week I was thinking of using "simultaneous" moves as a general
mechanism for removing first mover advantage, and possibly allowing many
pieces to move in parallel.  This can be done with pen &amp; paper, two boards
with a screen in between, or a program.  One can capture his own pieces.
If opposing pieces try to enter the same empty square, they annihilate each
other.  But if opposing pieces try to enter an occupied square, (only) the
original occupant survives.  The king becomes a moving target!  I think
the game would be a blast :-)

In the same vein, I thought of a series of Hex games (where first mover
normally has a "win") with different conflict resolution rules:
o Hex2 where neither player gets the spot and must avoid it for one move.
o Hex3 where a third color (grey) belonging to neither player takes the
spot.
o Hex4 where a randomly drawn stone (grey, belonging to neither player, or
clear, belonging to both), is placed in the spot.
o HexN where the players enter into a blind auction for the spot; winner
takes it but pays with stones; if a tie, re-bid or use Hex2 rule.

I also thought of a football-like game where a thrown ball moves kind of
like Carl describes, MxN squares per iteration...

One idea, many variations :-)  But no, I have not play-tested them -- very
hard to do solo!

Carl/anyone, how do we get a program written or modified to do this kind
of thing?  Or just play by email?

or against another on-line player.  The idea has probably been considered
many times before (any references?).  I know that there have been computer
chess programs that animated the pieces, but still followed the standard
rules of chess.  In the game that I am considering there would be several
changes in the rules to allow quick-thinking/acting  players a chance to
beat chess enthusiasts (I realize that chess enthusiasts may dislike

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
would appreciate any suggestions.  Thank you.

1. The board, the pieces, and the initial layout, are the same as in
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
chess.
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
2. The game is won by capturing the opponent's king, rather than
check-mating.  It is acceptable to place your king in check.
3. Pieces are moved forward on a clock cycle of around 1/2 second
(synchronization in on-line games may temporarily delay the clock).  The
white pieces are moved on the even timer counts, and the black pieces are
moved on the odd timer counts.
4. The players command their pieces to move by selecting a piece and the
piece's destination square.  The mouse is used to select the piece and its
destination.  The player does not have to wait to command a piece to move,
so it is possible for a player to have multiple pieces moving at once.
5. The destination for rooks, bishops, or queens can be several squares
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
away
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
(orthogonally, diagonally, or both, as is appropriate for the piece).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
does not have to be an open path to the destination square, but the
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
piece's
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
movement can be temporarily "blocked" as described below.
6. The destination square for kings, knights, or pawns is one standard
chess-move away.
7. The pieces move one square closer to their destination squares every
other cycle (see 3.).  For knights this "one square" is a move to the
destination square.
8. If a player's piece can't move into a square because it is, or would
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
be,
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
occupied by another one of the same player's pieces, the piece(s), halt
their movement.  Once the condition is removed (e.g., the opponent
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
captures
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
a blocking pawn), the piece will try to continue its course towards its
destination square (often capturing the piece that removed the blocking
piece).
9. If a piece moves into a square that contains an opponent's piece, the
opponent's piece is captured and removed from the game and the piece
continues its course towards the destination square.
10. Pawns reaching the last rank stay there until they are promoted (the
player clicks on the piece, and then on a pop-up panel with possible
selections).
11. Castling (if it is allowed) is performed in one cycle.
12. When two players are competing on-line, they don't know the opponent's
destinations squares.

I'm sure that there are several other details to consider, but this is my
first attempt at a "real-time action" chess-like game.
