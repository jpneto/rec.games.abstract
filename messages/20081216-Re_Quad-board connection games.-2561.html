Sorry about that -- I described this incorrectly. "Trellis" is played on the
VERTICIES. Each stone connect in 4 directions along the orthogonal lines and
in two more directions across squares of the same color. Paths can't cross
and a randomly filled board will have exactly one winner. See:

Ooops. Yeah, this one definitely doesn't work.

This looks like it could create infinite play.

It can, but I think both players would have to conspire for this to occur.
All it takes is one player to play rationally -- not expertly, just
reasonably -- to make irreversible connections. With the double piece
capture, KO may be impossible.

However, I don't generally like having to explicitly play
vertices/corners.  This makes the board not really a square grid, but
a square/octagon grid.  I have a few suggestions for how to avoid
this:

 1. Use a checker board.  Only black-to-black corners connect
    (regardless of who plays them).  This makes black squares more
    valuable than white squares, but this is symmetrical for both
    players.  This topologically equivalent to a square/octagon grid,
    but avoids plays on corners.

Works, though white squares are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>very<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> weak. If a modified FCFC were
implemented (Taking two black squares separated by one white square wins the
white square instantly.) games would likely have the same result with
essentially the same paths.

 2. Allow only three out of four squares in a 2x2 to be filled.
    Diagonals automatically connect.  A board is "filled" when no more
    pieces can be played without completing a 2x2.

Draws are possible. Below, neither player can take the cell marked "?".

Mark's "Crossway" is similar, prohibiting the a 2x2 checkered pattern to be
completed. I don't like the rule because it is supposedly just a way to mark
the connections, but it is possible to be in a position in which an extra
piece hurts you rather than helps you:

"O" to play, "O" wins by playing at "*"

"O" has an extra stone at (o) and loses!
