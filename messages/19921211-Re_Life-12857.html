People have theorized that it would be possible to make a
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>computer<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that operated on Life, with streams of gliders
instead of streams of data. It could be done. This is important,
because the rules of Life could actually be the rules of
growth of some kind of bacteria or something. And if so, an
actual <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>living<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> computer could be constructed.

Actually, I think it was Conway himself who put forth this idea.
(Life is either 20 or 21 this year, does anyone know what an
analogue for alcohol might be)

Somewhere around here I have a book, whose major title is
something like <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>The Game of Life<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.  The book consists of
alternating chapters of talk about Life and similar finite state
automata, and biographical data of John von Neumann.  There are
lot's of neat patterns, but some of them require large universes
to be observable.  Of course, now that some of us aren't
restricted to 24x80 character cell screens, this is much nicer.

At one time, I experimented with taking a fractal image, e.g. a
slice of almond bread, and using that as the initical conditions
for a Life universe.  Got a couple that lasted some tens of
thousands of iterations before stability.

Those of you who are interested might like to look at
comp.theory.cell-automata

And I have a question:  Some time ago, I wrote a Life simulation,
in FORTRAN, for VAX/VMS and UIS.  I'd like to resurrect that
program for Sun and X; rewriting the FORTRAN to C isn't a
problem, but UIS to X is an unknown, and I don't have any
VAXstations anymore.  Can anyone give me a hint?
