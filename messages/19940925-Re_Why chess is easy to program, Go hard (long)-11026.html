Thanks to George Shrier for an interesting article.
I do however have a couple of bones to pick:

	Interestingly, evaluation functions have not developed to a
commensurate degree. This is a significant observation.

Perhaps though, they have developed more than is generally appreciated?
It seems likely to me that the evaluation functions in the best PC
programs are quite advanced compared to say, Chess 4.5.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	The situation is clearer if we look at other unsolved games. The
table below is a subjective estimate, on a 1-4 scale, of how much effort was
put into other games, and how successful the results were in comparison to
human play. 

Game		Effort	Success
---------------------------------
Chess		4	3
Go		3	1
Othello		3	4
Checkers	2	4
Int'l Checkers	3	2
Kalah		1	4
Chinese Chess	2	1
Shogi		1	1	(from the land of consumer electronics!)

Perhaps you should have explained more about your estimate of effort?

While your rankings may be OK, perhaps the scale is a little off (or
at least not-linear). It would seem to me that the efforts that have
been put into computer chess probably exceed the combined efforts of
all the other games, perhaps by a factor of 10 or more. This isn't
reflected in your table.

cheers,
Peter
