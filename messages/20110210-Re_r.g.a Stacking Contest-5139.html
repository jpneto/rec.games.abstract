There can?  Quite honestly, I'm expecting Dieter to win in a fair decision.
People like his games and he put a lot of time into Mixtour.

Jeez, I wouldn't feel comfortable voting in such an atmosphere either. 
Nobody would.  Was this all extrapolated from the fact that I refused to
subject Monkey Queen to a public mockery of a "vote"?

Wrong.  The general public is moronic.

Ok, fine.  Fuck Bill Taylor.  The fact remains that the public is a lot more
enchanted with folk hero Christian Freeling than it is with bad boy Mark
Steere, giving you and your games an unfair advantage.  Yet you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>continue<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
to press for a public vote, albeit in future contests.  Again, fine.  Have a
public vote in a future contest that doesn't include my game.  Why don't we
stop worrying about future contests for the moment, and just see if we can
manage to get through this one?

I've never seen you so out of sorts, Christian.  You were really counting on
your star-struck public to pull you through here.  I'm tired of arguing
about this shit.  There will be a judgment and there will not be a public
vote.  Get over it or fuck off.

You know what you're doing right now, Christian?  Instead of just respecting
the will of the group, having a judgment instead of a public vote, and
moving on to the next topics like who the judges will be and what the
judgment criteria should be, you're creating a big stink.  Why?  So you can
withdraw your game and not subject it to its inevitable defeat against
Mixtour now that your supportive public has been ripped out from under you.

He who pulls out now pulls out nutless.
