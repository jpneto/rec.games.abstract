Kauri is an interesting Mancala game invented by Ralf Gering.  Kauri happens
to be infinite.  I.e. Kauri has an infinitely large game tree, and there's
nothing in the rules to prevent an endless cycle of moves from occurring.

Kauri rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Kauri_%28mancala_game%29">http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Kauri_%28mancala_game%29</a>

In particular:

"The game ends when no seeds are left on the board.  The player who captured
most seeds wins the game. If both players have captured the same number, the
game continues until one player can't move."

I.e., the players continue to sow the twelve cowries, which can never be
captured.

"His adversary is then declared the winner of the game. Draws are therefore
not possible."

Ralf Gering has provided us with a classic example of a designer "wishing"
his game finite.

Long overdue logic injection:

Ralf, your argument is self-referential:

1. "The game continues until one player can't move."
3. "Draws are therefore not possible."

And the reader is left wondering:

2. Why must there ever be a position where "one player can't move"?

Ralf Gering posted his response to my earlier Kauri critique here in a
Mancala forum.
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/message/2799">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/mancalagames/message/2799</a>

In particular:

"In a single lap game, which doesn't require feeding as in Oware, there are
no endless cycles and so there is no 'chasing' around."

The Gering lemma: Games that aren't Oware can't have endless cycles.

And Ralf Gering later commented in another forum:

"No, Mark. You know nothing about mancala games."
....
"Kauri isn't Oware.  You don't have to feed your opponent."
....
"you are arrogant all the time"
....
"Hochmut kommt vor dem Fall."

Oh great.  Now I'm going to "fall".  What the fuck does that mean?

"you are blind"

Ralf, your ad hominem is about as effective as your red herring.  You can't
explain away Kauri's infinity.  Not here in rec.games.abstract.
