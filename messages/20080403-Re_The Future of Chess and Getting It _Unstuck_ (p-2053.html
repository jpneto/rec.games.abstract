When you say "turn Chess into a solved game" it sounds like something
that will ruin the game.  When Chess is eventually solved that will be
testimony to the state of the art of computer science and nothing
more.  It won't have any impact whatsoever on Chess gameplay among
humans.  Checkers was solved.  Does that mean that you or I can now
sit down and force a draw against the world's leading Checkers
player?  No.  Does Checkers being solved have any impact whatsoever on
its gameplay among beginners, intermediate, or even expert players?
No.  Not unless you happen to have a supercomputer handy that can play
perfectly.

I'm surprised you didn't mention Go here, since it has a bigger game
tree. Of course, computers are improving there too, but at least it
has a little time left.

Then there's the game of Gess, which seems to have been deliberately
devised to be a game for supergeniuses and extraordinarily difficult
for computers.
