Here is another chess variation I made up yesterday. I played a few
games and liked it a lot: the game seems to be well balanced but can be
very surprising. If you have any comments, suggestions or ideas please
mail or post about it. I'm curious to hear from you all.

The pieces move the same as in normal chess. Before a player makes a
move, he throws a die. The number he or she throws is the number of
moves he must make. The following rules apply:
	- An opponent's piece can only be taken in the first move
	- Every piece may be moved only once in a roll
Note that a king can be in chess for a few moves, but after the roll
it should not be in chess anymore.
Castling is a king move.
If a player cannot move as many pieces as he rolled, the rest of the
moves does not take place. Stalemate only occurs if a player cannot
move any piece.

Good luck,
