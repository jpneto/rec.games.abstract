HAH.  That reminds me of one of my favourite Disney movie cartoons
of long ago, where Donuld Duck and/or his nephews got a can of
"Tratan Paint" and painted a wall with it, just slopping it
on and having it come out immediately with a lovely tartan!

I always wanted one of those, when I was a little kiddy.

Indigo is also subject to an anecdote.  When Newton was naming
the spectrum colours, he noticed that the blue end was very long
(without much colour change), unlike the red/orange/yellow end.
So he felt that there ought to be an extra colour or two there,
just to account for the (literally) bandwidth.  Hence indigo,
a colour which no-one jas ever actually SEEN in a rainbow,
but is at least a handy word beginning with a vowell for ROYGBIV.

My colleague used to say, that Newton saw this great bluish
space and felt that there needed to be two more colours there,
but couldn't think of anything to go with violet; but he
said to himself:    "Nonetheless, In Dey Go!... ... hey...!"

BUT ANYWAY:

Getting back to the point of this post, I often require twelve
colour names for various puzzles, possible games, etc.  This is
relevant to the original enquiry here, OC.  They must be short,
SINGLE words, and reasonably everyday words, (not interior
decorators' horrors!), preferably words that don't have a meaning
other than colours, like most of these below.

I have:-

black white grey brown red orange yellow green blue purple &amp; pink;

that's eleven, all good, proper colour-words. But I can't find
a clear-cut twelfth.  Silver &amp; Gold are too metally, and too close
to white &amp; yellow.  Violet is too close to purple, (and anyway is
a flower name, though I DO allow (also-a-fruit) orange, as you see).
Tan, khaki etc are too close to brown, and crimson, scarlet etc
too close to red.

So, what is to be the twelfth colour???

I await your votes and suggestions!
