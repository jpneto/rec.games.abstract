In both steps, the two aforesaid rules have to be inquired. Instead,
in the current rules as written, the process is simpler: first the
"don't split" rule determines if a stone can be moved, without
reference to the second rule, and then the "move closer" rule
determines its available destination points, without further inquiring
the first rule; i.e.:

Hmm, after giving it a second thought I realized something which
invalidates that line of reasoning. Allowing groups to be split
momentarily during a turn isn't more complicated, either conceptually
or computationally, if you approach move generation in reverse order,
i.e.: first check which points are valid destination points for a
stone, then check which stones can move there:

1. Is this a valid destination point for a stone? Yes, if it's
adjacent to any friendly unit and, when occupied, the distance between
that unit and the closest friendly unit is reduced.

2. Can this stone be moved there? Yes, if all stones which were joined
in a single group before the move would remain joined after the move.

I'm curious about the restriction that you can't split the

So no, it isn't. Thanks for pointing this out, Steve. Consider it
fixed :-)

Just to make things clear, the revised rule for moving groups is as
follows:

"To move a group, you must pick a stone in it and place it on another
point adjacent to the group. All stones which were joined in a single
group before the move must remain joined at the end of the move."- Hide quoted text -

The amended rule may not affect actual play much, because as you said
it's only in rare cases where the difference matters.  It's more about
following the general game design principle that additional rules,
restrictions etc. only be included if they're clearly necessary.
("When in doubt leave it out.")   My revised version of Forms is
actually more restrictive than the original version, however the
restrictions clearly result in increased strategic interest.  If the
improvement had only been marginal, I would have left it alone.

btw I like the starting set-up for Ayu.  It occurs to me that many
games could perhaps be invented using this set-up to advantage.
