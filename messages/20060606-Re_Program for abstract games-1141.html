<br>&gt; This looks interesting, and thanks for making it available.&nbsp; I have
<br>&gt; been working on something that is roughly along the same lines.
<br>
<br>Thank you for your feedback! Since you've been working on a hobby project
<br>you know how important it is to get some comments :-)
<br>
<br>&gt; You really need to add the ability to create AI players, I hope that
<br>&gt; will come soon.
<br>
<br>AI players defined in the game script are not too difficult to
<br>implement. This is one of my short term goals. Obviously I have to
<br>write some AI players to check if the code works, and I have to add
<br>the user interface to select that player, and I have to update the
<br>documentation. This is a lot of work, but it is a must do!
<br>
<br>&gt; Are you trying to do something that is comparable to ZoG (Zillions of
<br>&gt; Games)?
<br>
<br>Well... Nomignolov is just a one-man project :-) ZoG is
<br>wonderful: since I tried the demo I was fascinated. I think its main
<br>faults are: it's not free; it's for windows only; it seems to me that
<br>its scripting language it's a bit too like Lisp.
<br>
<br>I don't think to be able to do something like ZoG. I just want to have
<br>a toy to play with and:
<br>- to try new abstract games (now)
<br>- to make moves statistics of different games (in the future)
<br>- to search for game records, like maximum/minimum number of moves,
<br>etc (in the future)
<br>- to solve checkmates, puzzles, ... (in the far future)
<br>- ... (others that are more in my dreams than in the positive axis of
<br>time)

<br>Bye, Jean
