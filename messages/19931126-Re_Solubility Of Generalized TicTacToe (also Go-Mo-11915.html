In a recent post about the solution of Go-Moku, the writer
wrote that since the game was solved for a 15x15 board, it
was thus solved for the 19x19. At first this seemed
intuitively obvious: if you can form a row of 5 on a board
of some fixed size, you can do the same on any bigger board.
However, after thinking for a while I became less convinced.
Although the larger board gives you more freedom, it also
gives your opponent the same freedom. Is it not possible that
at some stage in the strategy, a move will create a position
which allows the 2nd player to take the initiative and at 
least force a draw.

Nicholas Gray is perfectly right with the above statement.

In the articles we wrote on the solution of Go-Moku, we have
always been careful not to make the claim for the 19x19 board,
exactly for the stated reason.

I believe the first time this incorrect conclusion was drawn was
in Scientific American, where the proof was shortly mentioned.

Personally, I do believe of course, that on the 19x19 board Go-Moku is
also a win. I would have to check the whole solution tree, however,
to see if in none of the lines the opponent has extra options for
defending against the black winning attack. Even if one or two lines
(out of the 150,000) turn out to be blockable, there very likely will
be alternatives for Black, which create a slightly different proof.

Strictly speaking, however, the result cannot be generalized to any
other board size than 15x15, as correctly pointed out by Nicholas.
