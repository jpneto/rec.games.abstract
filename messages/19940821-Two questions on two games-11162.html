Upon discovering this group I feel like posting a million 
questions, for I used to be an addict of abstract games, but
I will restrict myself to two.

One of my favorite games was described in Gamut of Games and
was called Lines of Action.  It was played with a checker set 
and board, lining the white pieces along two parallel edges
and the black ones along the other two edges.  The object was
to end up with your remaining pieces connected.  For some reason 
I have not seen it mentioned much, and yet I found it a very
exciting game.  Perhaps it suffered the fate of games which
cannot be marketed given that they can be played with a set
already in the market.  Nobody has an interest in promoting
them.  Then perhaps somebody gave it a different name (as
was done with Reversi) and I don't know about it,

The other question regards Sprouts, which was very popular in
math departments in the sixties, and was featured in the 
book Macroscope.  In those days it was known that the second player 
won the six point straight game, but the seven point was unknown.
So were the misere (last player loses) six point games.  Does
anybody know if those are solved?  Also, has anybody deviced an
easy notation for e-mail play?  Since it required drawing curves
it is not easy to record other than by sending a sheet of paper
back and forth.

I must sound like I'm Rip Van Winkle waking up.  When in the academic
world we used to discuss all these games, but I left it years ago, 
and have not thought much about them since.
