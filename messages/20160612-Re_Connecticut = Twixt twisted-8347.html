I am done arguing with you Hazen because you are such an unassimilable  (or non-entity rather), you apparently can't even read English correctly, having just inverted what I actually said.

In the words of Harold Bloom: He can't think, he can't write. There is no discernible talent.

For sure you master English better than me.
But I speak and read french and 3 languages better than you.
So hiding behind my poor English is just a tricky way to escape to my critics as game designer. You are plagiarizer and crappy game designer. Nothing will help you to be a good game designer.
YOU HAVE NO TALENT AS GAME DESIGNER!!!!
