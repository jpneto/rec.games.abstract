Well, it's actually a rules simplification. Also, sometimes this is
better than selling out players, changing gameplay for the promise of
better rules... ;)

I will play it, that's for sure. I have a weakness for finite Go
variants. This one seems at least as intriguing in actual play as my
own Goncrete, and it's probably more natural despite using an extra
kind of stones.

This said, further research is certainly needed to try and find the
ideal finite Go variant, but maybe it just doesn't exist. Red Stone
(or whatever), Goncrete, Rin and Sygo are only approximations to that
ideal. As far as I know, Go on a hexhex board is also virtually
finite, but tactics are less varied.

These are my top preferred names for this game, Plasma aside:

1. Rwb (short for "Red, White, Black"; maybe too Burmish)
2. Vermilion
3. Red Stone (why not?)
4. Eritro (from "Erythro", "red" in Old Greek)
5. Currants (they can be white, red or black!)

As a person with a game called Goncrete, I'm probably not the best
person to suggest a valid name, though...
