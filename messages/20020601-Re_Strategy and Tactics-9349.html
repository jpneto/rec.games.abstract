In one of their games, the computer surprised Kasparov by sacrificing
a piece.  Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make
sacrifices for strategic reasons.  In the post-mordem analysis,
Kasparov realized that the computer must have analyzed all possible
variations at least up to the point where the computer regained the
sacrificed material.  I.e. the computer didn't sacrifice the piece for
strategic reasons but for purely tactical ones.

It would be more accurate to say that Kasparov asserted that.  I don't
think his understanding of Deep Blue's play is really good enough for
him to understand how it makes decisions.  That's partly because the
algorithms are still secret, but mostly because it's clear from his
subsequent comments about the match that he still doesn't really
understand computers very well (not surprising, since he's a chess
player, not a computer scientist).

The game I'm referring to did not occur in the final match that
Kasparov lost but rather in an earlier match that Kasparov won.
I may be wrong but I believe computer printouts later verified the
correctness of the assertion.  Also, it was not just Kasparov's
assertion; others said the same thing.  I'm not aware of any
knowledgeable persons who made a contradictory claim about the
position in question.

Your statement, "Computer programs are not supposed to be able to make

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'm not aware of even a single instance where a computer program
sacrificed a piece when it was not able to search the subsequent
position to a depth where it would regain the piece.  If you know
of any examples, I would welcome seeing them.  Otherwise, I stand
by my statement.

There's no reason at
all that computer programs can't use "strategic" as well as "tactical"
criteria, and in fact all reasonable computer chess programs, and
certainly Deep Blue, have lots of "strategic" evaluation criteria, not
just the raw evaluation of material.  It's certainly possible for such
programs to evaluate strategic (positional) factors as being worth more
than a material deficit (although this is of course more likely to apply
to a deficit of a pawn than of a whole piece).

Of course computer program use other criteria besides just material
evaluation.  But I've never seen a position where a good computer
program correctly determined that strategic criteria outweighed
the loss of a piece.  The strategic evaluation of current computer
programs seems too primitive for this.  (They make up for a less
refined evaluation by infallible calculation and searching to a
depth beyond what any human can do.)
