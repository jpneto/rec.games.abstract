P.S.  This entire post was brought about from a single sentence I read in an
online article a moment ago, regarding Kasparov's game tomorrow:

   "Man and machine will face off one in the
   final match on Tuesday.  Kasparov will be
   confident after Sunday's victory, but will
   have the disadvantage of playing black."

"The disadvantage of playing black..."  Sigh... it shouldn't be that way, at
least not if there's a solution.

But isn't there already a solution: that there are multiple games and
both players get to play white and equal number of times? (Sorry, I'm
not familiar with Chess tournament rules).

P.S.S.  Sorry for the long post.  I know the length of it alone will deter
many from reading it!

It was interesting...the pie rule is a cool mechanic.  Have ever tried
the game San Marco?  It's a whole game of pie rules.

However, as you alluded to, first-player advantage is not the main
problem with chess.  It's a great game, but it's not that fun if you
don't play with someone of comparatable skill (which is difficult
thanks to two of the game's strengths:  its deepness and the volumes
of analysis written on it).  Also, the preponderance of draws makes
high level play frustrating to follow.  Didn't Kasparov and the
computer draw in the end for the whole match?  As an American raised
on extra innings and double overtimes, I have to shake my head.
