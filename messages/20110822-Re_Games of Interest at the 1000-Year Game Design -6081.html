My reasoning: Flume is like other dots-n-boxes games in that the
opening is obscure to newbies. The vast majority of people don't see
the depth in these kinds of games are because the openings are so hard
to comprehend.

That's true to an equal degree, if not more so, for Oust. For lack of
playing experience I'm not qualified to give a detailed comparison but
I feel Flume stands a better chance.

The contest administrators aren't going to be able play any of the
entries in depth enough to get past opening bafflement. In other
words, the games which give a good first impression will win even if
they're not the most worthy of victory.  Ergo, Flume is maybe not the
most strategic choice. Rebuttal?

Of course meeting the condition isn't dependent on the nature of the
game alone. Anyone who claims to be able to predict what the world
will be like for humans in a thousand years from now, if there are any
that is, or what 'being human' even means by that time, is fooling at
least one person.
