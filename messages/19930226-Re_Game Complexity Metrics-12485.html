|&gt; &gt; There has been much discussion on this group recently about the
|&gt; &gt; "complexity" of a game.  The goal of this note is to start a
|&gt; &gt; discussion about the important dimensions along which games could be
|&gt; &gt; echaracterised, as they are related to the complexity of a game.
|&gt; &gt; 
    [stuff deleted]
|&gt; I agree, how about a metric that measures the number of moves available that 
|&gt; are effectively different.  This would rule out mirror image moves, equate
|&gt; "wasted" moves (i.e. taking a hit in blackjack when you're already busted) and
|&gt; attempt to reduce the complexity of the moves.  For example, in trivial GO 
|&gt; there is effectively only two possible moves for each player on each turn.
|&gt; This is realized when the "differentness" of the available moves is seen to
|&gt; be non-existant.
|&gt; 

The problem with "differentness" is that it relates the moves to their
ultimate goals, and relies on an analysis which is pretty
sophisticated, basically mapping the problem into an entirely
different but more effective representation.  This is certainly a key
area of research, but (at least in the general formulation) is not
useful as a simple metric on a game which could be automatically
detected.  

By the way, Dan, much of the work on these kind of
representation transformations in games has been done at UNC, by
Benerji, Ernst, and Goldstein.  Are you or anyone else on this group
involved in that work also?   

|&gt; &gt; 
|&gt; &gt; To start the list off, I have thought of the following:
|&gt; &gt; 
|&gt; [ rules deleted ]
|&gt; 
|&gt; &gt; 3. Rule Complexity RULE(Game,L): 
|&gt; &gt; The length of the smallest representation of the rules of the game in
|&gt; &gt; a pre-specified game description language L.  Different choices of L
|&gt; &gt; yield different rule complexities.  This brings up the question: "what
|&gt; &gt; does it mean for some set of rules to be a representation of a game?"
|&gt; &gt; I'll defer answering this question for this article, assuming that we
|&gt; &gt; can agree when a program is really playing the game by the right
|&gt; &gt; rules.   
|&gt; 
|&gt; Measuring the complexity of the rules seems to be an extremely difficult task
|&gt; and one without clear value.  Consider another version of Trivial-GO that had
|&gt; extremely complex rules that calculated exactly one position that your 
|&gt; opponent could not move based on your last move.  (Imagine something extremely
|&gt; contrived and complex that relates the new number of pieces in your row, 
|&gt; in your column, the total number of your pieces and your opponent's pieces in 
|&gt; the four quadrants generated by your move.  Then imagine additional verbage 
|&gt; describing what to do when the stone is placed on an edge or corner and there 
|&gt; are degenerate quadrants, etc. ,etc.)  The rule would minutely limit the 
|&gt; number of possible locations that a stone could be placed, but clearly not 
|&gt; effect the overall outcome of the game.  The end result is the exactly the 
|&gt; same as the original game (white never passes and always wins, but the rule 
|&gt; metric has been made much more complex, while the state search space has only 
|&gt; been reduced by a small amount.  Contrived as this is, I've seen games where 
|&gt; the explanation of the rules becomes exponentially complex when discussing 
|&gt; extremely rare situations and boundary conditions.
|&gt; 

Of course rule complexity is not guaranteed to be useful, just like
state complexity might not be useful.  I have received a similar
response over email from several people, who generally like you give
some modification of trivial go with some very complicated special
cases which don't seem to affect the game strategy much if at all.  
One point make against this is that while they only constrain some
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>special case<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> which seems not to happen very often, it is possible
that this becomes the basis for a larger change in strategy.   
For example, consider the contrived rule you sketched above, which
gives a rule for one square on which you could not move based on my
last move.  With some calculation, I may be able to come up with a
strategy for the second player which made the last move of the first
player (which would normally win the game by placing the 181st stone) 
become unplayable.  Then the first player would have to pass, and the
second could play that square, thus winning the game!!!  
Thus what looks like a rare special case may give rise to deep
strategy.  

If we look at other known games with special-case rules (like
en-passant in chess), this is confirmed.  It is rare that you actually
take my pawn en-passant, the presence of this rule constrains many
variations in the openings and even in endgames.  Same with the rule
about not castling through check.  Even more special-case, look at the
k-move-rule for drawing a game.  The endings which are drawn because
of this are somewhat obscure, but knowing this fact about the endgame
often dictates which endgames we wish to enter, which has implications
right back into the opening.  

|&gt; Some metric that short circuits this type of situation must be employed to
|&gt; generate useful information about the relative complexity of different games.
|&gt; 

I agree this must be done for distinctions which really are
disconnected from the goals of the game, but determining this requires
more analysis than any simple metric can provide.  

Perhaps the only conclusion we can reach on game complexity metrics is
that they can be used as guidelines by humans with respect to
particular games to argue about their relative complexity.  Still, I
would really like to have some good computable metrics, at least to use
as guidelines for an automatic game generator!
