I used to make the general argument that draws suck.  They're anti-
climactic and deflating.  I pretty much gave up on that since it has
always been met with angry rebuttals from defensive Chess enthusiasts
like "That's just your opinion!  The draw is a welcome conclusion
between equally matched blah blah blah blah blah."

The tone of this discussion seems to lend credence to my premise.

If people like draws, then they should be allowed
to voice their opinion. It is not difficult to see the origin
of this affection - I'd guess every chess player has some
draws that he has enjoyed and is proud of.

Instead, what has happened in this thread has happened often.
Someone will propose an anti-draw measure, and we see
completely far-fetched totally ridiculous objections (in this
case, the idea that it will result in a massive, fantastic
cheating scheme) The flaws in those arguments should
certainly be exposed.

It requires an open mind to discuss the merits and problems of a
proposal. But this is an issue where there is
an orthodoxy ("the current way is the only way") which
tolerates no hint of an open mind.
