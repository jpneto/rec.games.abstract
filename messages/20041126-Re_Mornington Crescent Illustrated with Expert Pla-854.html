I have made my article "Mornington Crescent Illustrated with Expert Play:
Simplified and Explained for Novices" available online. This article was
recently published in the exclusive Mornington Crescent Journal, and the
publishers have gratefully allowed me to reproduce it online, in the
interests of the promotion of the sport. Read it for yourself here:

At the personal request of the President of the British Mornington Crescent
Saturday League, I have added two sections about Conduct and Software.

Conduct
Mornington Crescent is traditionally a gentleman's game. Although in the
modern form of the game there are no restrictions of race, religion, culture
or gender that function as prerequisites to become a sanctioned player, a
gentlemanly code of conduct still pervades the game. A spirit of courtesy
and politeness is absolutely required for all players. At the discretion of
the senior judge, anything deemed contrary to such a spirit will result in
an immediate player expulsion, and usually the forfeit of all geographic
privileges and a handicap of two red game tokens for subsequent games.

Software

To my knowledge there is no computer program that can play Mornington
Crescent effectively on the intermediate level, mainly because of the
boundless possibilities that the game allows for creative thinking and
imaginative play. In contrast to chess (where the limited number of moves
per turn has enabled the rapid advancement of highly developed chess-playing
software), the complexity of Mornington Crescent is beyond the scope of most
computers, particularly when combined with the multiple variations
available. In this respect Mornington Crescent faces a dilemma similar to
the classic strategy game of Go. Like Mornington Crescent, the strongest Go
software is weaker than the average player, despite decades of serious
effort. Similarly, although some Mornington Crescent software exists, it is
of an inferior and unsatisfying standard, not much beyond the novice level.
Most enthusiasts do not usually bother practice playing against computers,
because it promotes the development of strategies that will be ineffective
against humans. The observation and study of expert level games is highly
preferred over the use of any software.
