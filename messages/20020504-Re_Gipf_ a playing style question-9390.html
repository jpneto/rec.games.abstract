Hello!

 From what i have heard and read in the beligan tournaments, there is
no good standard answer on this. I think that 4 Gipf pieces is
considered balanced play. However, 3-5 pieces is common too.

There have also been successful attempts, earlier, to play only with
gipf pieces for a long time (anywhere from 8-20) remembering that you
are allowed to keep playing Gipf pieces even if you have to start
removing your own. This is the way I usually like to play, simply
because setting up a row with 4 Gipf pieces, or a block of them near
the center, is very powerful

On gipf.com, it was also mentioned that one of the tied winner from a
recent tournament played with only 1. To me, this would appear to be a
mistake, but I haven't played enough(because it appears as there is
more freedom with 2,3,4, and often you are able to choose which one to
remove).

In potential games it is a somewhat different matter, since you want
to start playing potential pieces as soon as possible (especially the
Tamsk potential).

For those of you that play Gipf with the tournament rules, how many Gipf
pieces (that's two basic pieces stacked) do you usually use before you start
bringing on the basic pieces?

I've been playing Gipf about two months with the basic and then the standard
rules.  But I just began using the tournament rules this week.  And in the
five games I played this week I used six Gipf pieces (and therefore six
basic pieces) in four of those games.  This seemed about right to me.  But I
wondered what more experienced players thought.
