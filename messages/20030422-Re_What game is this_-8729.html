Hi!

I recently visited China and purchased a game that I am curious to
find more information about.  I was hoping to email a picture, but I
am using Google and it does not have that feature.

The game contains 25 rectangular pieces each of which contain two
Chinese characters.  There are three sets of three pieces, five sets
of two pieces and three single pieces.  I am not sure what the
characters on the pieces stand for.

The board is divided into two sides.  The playing spaces are a series
of 23 rectangles, five circular spaces in the middle of the board in
the shape of a '5' on a die, and finally two spaces which look like
the Alamo.  These Alamo shapes spaces are on the row closest to each
player.  There are also three more rectangular spaces and two more
larger round spaces in the center of the board seporating both sides.

The guide I was with said it was a 'Generals' game, so I am assuming
it is a war game.  It came with no instructions and I can not find the
company on the web.  The company that made it is Guoqu in Guangzhou.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!
