The following is a new abstract board game, which I'm naming Astoria,
which I can do, because I came up with it and because my girlfriend
lives there, not that I need an excuse:

For any natural number n, Astoria is played on a 2nx2n grid of
rectangular spaces. Each of the 2 players has ((2n)^2)/2 pieces
(half as many as are needed to cover the board), of which half
are triangular, and half are circular.

Players alternate turns. On a turn, each player places one piece
on the board; if it is a triangle, he/she orients it toward one of the
four board sides (north, south, east, west). After placing a piece,
the player is required to "push."

The rules of pushing are as follows: the player selects a direction
to push, either north, south, east or west. For north and south
pushes, for all columns in which the player has the highest score,
all pieces are moved north (or south) one space; if a piece is
at the northernmost (southernmost) point, it is pushed off the
board and discarded. For east and west pushes, the analogous
rule is applied to rows. A player's score in a row (or column)
is the total number of circles that player has in that row (column)
plus 3 x the number of triangles that player has in that row
or column, *oriented in the direction of the push.* Triangles
not oriented in the direction of the push score no points.

A player must push, but may elect a direction in which he/she
does not have the greatest score in any row (or column,
as applicable), in which case no push takes place. 

Play alternates until all pieces have been placed on the board.
At the end of the game, the player with the most total pieces
remaining on the board (triangles and circles counting equally)
is the winner.

Typical n is 4, resulting in an 8x8 board. This is the size I've
experimented with.

... OK, guys 'n' gals, eat me alive. How trivially solvable
is this game?

Proving my own absurdity, I have already implemented a graphics-
based MSDOS version of it. Cutting out pieces never really
occurred to me. (:
