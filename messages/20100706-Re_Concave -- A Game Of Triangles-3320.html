Here is a game for any plural number of players.

Needed: Blank piece of paper and a pen/pencil.

In the first part of the game, players take turns placing n dots on
the paper. No 3 dots are to be co-linear. n is determined ahead of
time amongst the players and is a multiple of the number of players.

The first player to move connects any (almost any) 3 dots with 3
straight line segments to make a triangle, such that no dots are on
the interior of the triangle.

Three dots cannot be connected such that there are any dots in the

Thereafter, the players continue to take turns. On a turn, a player
makes a triangle either by connecting (with two straight line
segments) a single dot to two dots that are at the ends of the side of
a triangle already drawn, or by drawing a single line connecting two
dots that are two vertices of two adjacent triangles that come
together to form a concave angle (a concave angle along the perimeter
of the polygon containing all the triangles drawn so far).

No line-segments shall coincide with line-segments already drawn.

The triangles drawn in this game shall contain no dots in their
interiors.

After a player moves, she gets a point for each concave angle along
the perimeter of the bounding polygon, the polygon containing all the
triangles drawn so far.

My English may be a bit weak, but I'm not completely sure what you mean
by "concave angle".  I know obtuse and acute angles and concave and
convex polygons, but I don't recall seing the word "concave" being used
about angles.  Are they angles of more than 180 degrees?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


Yes, I mean an angle greater than 180 degrees. The "concave angles",
or what are actually called 'reflex angles', I am referring to are
along the permeter of the bounding polygon. So, if there is at least
one concave/reflex angle, then the bounding polygon is a concave
polygon.

The player gets an addition point every move he completes a triangle
with only one line-segment.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Would this not be the same as saying that a player scores the number of
acute angles either before or after his move, whichever gives the most
points?  If a player closes a triangle with one line segment, the number
of acute angles (as I understand the term) is reduced by one, so 1 plus
the number of remaining acute angles is the same as the number of acute
angles before the move.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think by "acute angles" you mean what I refer to as "concave
angles", or reflex angles.  Yes, drawing just one line to make a
triangle deprives the player of a point from a reflex angles at the
same time it gains him a point for drawing one line. But the player
has also deprived the next player -- and the next, and maybe himself
again on his next move -- an additional point from the reduction in
reflex angles. Strategy.
