Baloney pie.   Christian, you can't possibly be claiming that Symple is the
"perfect game".  Mine eyes perceive it but it's too outlandish a claim, even
from you, for me to process.


The mythical perfect game would never have unbearable kludges such as
Symple's

"There's one exception to the above. If, and only if, neither player has
grown yet, then black on his turn may use both the above options in the
above order: he may place a stone, therewith creating a new group, and he
may grow any or all of his other (!) groups."

That is the very procedure that shifts the move advantage from the
first to the second player.

and:

"A player's score is counted as the number of stones he has placed on the
board minus four points for every separate group."
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

And that's the very theme - group penalty - of which Symple is the
quintessential implementation.

You treat the theme itself as if it were a undesirable byproduct and
the beautiful balancing rule the mechanism provides earned itself an
'aestetic hiroshima'. It seems you've locked yourself in in
infallibility, finitophylia and cyclophobia, of which the latter two
are defendable, though limiting. Isn't it boring to see 'the truth'
all the time?
