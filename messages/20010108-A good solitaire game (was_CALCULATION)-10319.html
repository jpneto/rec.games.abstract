 In the recent millenium in <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:CFuKA4.Bu1@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz">&lt;CFuKA4.Bu1@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz&gt;</a>
Bill Taylor (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:wft@math.canterbury.ac.nz">wft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</a>) described a solitaire game:
# CALCULATION
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# A shuffled pack is face-down before you,
# and cards turned over one by one.
#
# Each card, on being turned over, must be played onto either:
! one of H "holding piles", or:  one of four "goal piles".
!    We'll call this game G(H).  Usually G(4) is played.
!    The top card of a holding pile can also be moved to an
!    appropriate goalpile at any time. [jda]
# The four goalpiles are built up regardless of suit, but in different ways.
# One must begin with an Ace, one with a 2, one with a 3, and one with a 4.
# Subsequent cards may be put on, if the number is exactly "n" above the last
# card placed, for pile with base "n";  all done modulo 13;J=11,Q=12, K=13.
#
That is to say the four goalpiles are built up, without regard to
suit, as:
	A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K.
	2,4,6,8,T,Q,A,3,5,7,9,J,K.
	3,6,9,Q,2,5,8,J,A,4,7,T,K.
	4,8,Q,3,7,J,2,6,T,A,5,9,K.
The game is won if you play all 52 cards to the goalpiles.
#
# [At first, G(4)] seemed so hard that I couldn't believe it would
# ever come out, not beyond a lucky 1% at most, anyway.  But as I
# struggled more ... I almost thought I could win nearly every time,
# if I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> concentrated on the calculations!)
#
# Give it a whirl !

You can't win G(4) <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>every time<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.
If the first 20 cards are, in order,
2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3, 4,4,4,4, 5,5,5,5, 6,6,6,6
then there will be no hope of making progress in the 1's pile.

Puzzle 1:
What's the shortest starting sequence which ensures defeat of G(4)?

Puzzle 2:
What is the smallest N_p such that Player can guarantee victory
in G(N_p) ?

Puzzle 3:
Suppose the cards aren't shuffled, but preset by an enemy.
What is the largest N_e such that Enemy can guarantee our defeat
in G(N_e) ?

Puzzle 4:
Is it necessarily true that N_p = N_e + 1 ?

----------------------
I've practiced the game off and on since Bill posted.  I
win G(4) about 90% of the time, and G(3) perhaps 35% but I use
a technique others may consider cheating:

I stagger the cards in the holding piles so that all are visible,
and position them a few millimeters to the left or the right
according to whether I plan to put them into the 1st or the 4th
goalpile respectively.  This helps me untask my short-term memory
and makes the game more relaxing whether it helps me win or not.
Is this cheating?

Best wishes, James
