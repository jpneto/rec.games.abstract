==========================================================



The problem with this strategy is many impementations of this game is that
the basic goal, which renders a huge bonus, is to remove everything. It
seems as it would be very hard to provide a general strategy to achieve
this, and it would probably be much more tactical than the one you describe
generally is.

   If this is the game I am thinking about...  I do not have a winning
   strategy to guarantee the absolute best score, but one thing I remember
   is that the score for groups of blocks is equal to the square of the
   number of blocks of the same color that are connected.  Using this
   knowledge, I was able to get consistantly high scores by picking out
   a single color and sacrificeing all other blocks and colors just so I
   may be able to get as many blocks together of this particular color.
   when I was able to get several blocks of that color together then the
   score was somewhat high (10^2 = 100 for that group alone)  other hints
   I used to get high scores: 1) choose a color that has at least one

   of that color in each column - it is much easier to connect the blocks
   when there is actually something there to connect them :-)   2) IIRC, I
   choose a color that had most of its blocks high up in the columns, this
   way if I made a mistake I could correct it later on as they got lower

and
