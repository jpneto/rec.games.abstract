Though "LARIAT, the winning condition" sounds very interesting at first,
"LARIAT, the game" without Unlur-type balancing, is flawed.

Take the center then take then mirror the second player's moves.

Very interesting.  I had envisioned a scenario in which the players
start a battle at the base ring and carry it all the way out to the
end point, at which time one player would claim the end point and
win.  But I hadn't formalized it to the extent of creating a move
mirroring algorithm.  Still, it's something that should be completely
cleared up just by the simple application of the pie rule, right?  If
so I wouldn't call it flawed.  An n-iteration pie rule would
definitely straighten it out.

That center cell can't exist.

It has to exist.  Without it there could be a draw.

I know.  That's the whole point of it, no pun intended.

Andantino has two win conditions

N-in-a-row won't happen in my games.  That and the Checkers jump are
preclusions 1 and 2.

Lariat, while interesting in its own right just for being canonical,
was kind of a stepping stone to Super Lariat.  Super Lariat does have
two win conditions.

Thanks for looking into it.  It's not a total surprise, but it does
underscore the need for the pie rule.
