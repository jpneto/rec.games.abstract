If Chess is garbage what are Shither or Connectishit or Cartezero?
Huge dropping!!!

I`m chess fan.
I started playing chess at 6 years old. My father and one of his friend were my teachers. It does not take 4 years that no one could be me in my neighborhood (we had 2 clubs on my neighborhood).
I left this wonderful game (no one could beat me so why continuing to play) and started inventing my own games.
I was kid and teen after being kid so I could not stay enslaved by any interest. From games to mathematics for maths to art from art to inventing machines from inventing machines to politics from politics to women from women to espionage and so on. I still did not find something very challenging. 
I`m now cancer free if we believe the results of my last scan.
If I live just 10 years from now be sure that my legacy will surprise the world.
