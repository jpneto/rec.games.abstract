 &gt;Here is a little puzzle.
 &gt;
 &gt;You have 10 stacks of 10 coins.  One whole stack of coins is counterfeit.
 &gt;Each real coin weighs 10 grams.  Each counterfeit coin weighs 11 grams. 
 &gt;You have the use of a scale ( not a balance ) that reads weight in grams. 
 &gt;Using only one weighing, how can you determine which stack is counterfeit.


  Couldn't you take 0 coins from one pile, 1 from the next, 2 from the 
 next, and so on up to 9 from the last, then weigh this "new" collection 
 and know from the number (n) in the singles column of the total 
 weight which is the stack of the counterfeits [answer being n+1]?
 For example:
 
 stack #               1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
 # of taken coins      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

  If stack #7 were the counterfeit one, the weight of the taken coins 
 would be:             0   10  20  30  40  50  66  70  80  90

 and the total sum = 456    thus, n=6 so n+1 = stack #7.

  This should work for all stacks (i.e. if the counterfeits were in stack 
 #1, the total weight of the taken coins would end in a 0 and 0+1= stack #1)
