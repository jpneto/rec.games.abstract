Hi everybody !


Could you please repost the article which contained the
address of the http site dedicated to Renju ?
I've lost it by accident.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The renju Web page is not yet finished. Still there are no http address.
As soon as it is finished (within a few weeks I will tell about it in
this newsgroup.

By now you  can get two files at ftp.pi.se drectories pub/pc/games/renju.
It is my letter (r1rulhis.doc) about the rules and history of renju,
pente, and other five in a row games written in Mocrosoft Word 6.0
(the figures are right which was not the fact in my letter sent to this
newsgroup) and a DOS-program including more than 1000 renjugames 
(r2dafree.zip)for example all games played by the World Champions
 in the three last World Championships.If you try it
press F1,F8,F3 and browse with the arrows between the games. Maybe you do
not understand all the games but it is a good way to learn to try to
understand.
I also plan to put at the same directory (within a week) pictures of
some of the players involved in the World Championship games.

Friendly Yours,

Tommy Maltell, President of Renju International Federation
