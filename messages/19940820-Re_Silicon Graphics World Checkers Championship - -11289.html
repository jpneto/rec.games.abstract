|&gt;     What a swell victory.  Chinook is "world champion" without winning a
|&gt; single game.  USUALLY a challenger has to have a + score to claim the title.
|&gt;     Resigning the match sounds like typical Tinsley sportsmanship.  After
|&gt; all, in the previous match, he bent over backwards to give Chinook a chance,
|&gt; then played under conditions that were highly favorable to the machine ---
|&gt; which after all never suffers from fatigue.
|&gt;     Too bad the Chinook team doesn't have such sportsmanship.  IMO the match
|&gt; should have been declared a draw with the champion retaining his title until
|&gt; his health improved enough for a rematch.  Tinsley gave you guys every
|&gt; possible break, and IMO you're just taking advantage of his overdeveloped
|&gt; sense of fair play.  Guess that's just another area where machines are
|&gt; superior, they don't suffer from that human weakness.
|&gt; 
|&gt; &gt;This is not the way we wanted the match to end.  While we wish the
|&gt; &gt;best for Tinsley's health, nevertheless, we are all very, very
|&gt; &gt;disappointed.
|&gt;     But you can console yourselves with your undeserved and meaningless title.
|&gt; 
I disagree.  Dr. Tinsley was quite correct to resign the match, though it
was certainly very sad that he could not continue it.  Any match rules I've
ever heard of stipulate showing up for scheduled games, and allow a certain
number of postponements.  Too bad, but there it is. 

I think accusing the Chinook lot of poor sportsmanship is out of line.

I agree that the Chinook team did not show poor sportsmanship and were
in no way obligated to do anything more than they had.

However, considering the sacrifices Tinsley made to make the matches
possible, it would have been good form if they had not accepted the
title.
