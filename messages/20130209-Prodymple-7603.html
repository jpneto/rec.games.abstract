Chat copied from Game Site X:

MarkSteere&gt; Christ I'm tired of recombined old ideas. I'd come up with some new ideas if I could, but I think I've reached the end of the line.  But I'd rather just see nothing than recombined stuff.

Zurround&gt; its a GREAT idea... hexxagon moves with Ketchup win of biggest GROUP

MarkSteere&gt; No doubt... AMAZING!!!!

Zurround&gt; dont be sarcastic

MarkSteere&gt; I tried to tell you I'm sick of recombined crap. Now Christian is announcing Symple/Produto. Just shoot me. No, that'd be too easy. Kill me with torture.

Zurround&gt; what the hell is Symple/Produto??? i do not understand that term?

MarkSteere&gt; Produto is a game of Nick Bentley that so far four people have copied. Symple is a nauseating game. Put 'em together and you have an over-copied game with nausea that exceeds the sum of it's nauseating parts.

Zurround&gt; never heard of them

MarkSteere&gt; Clue in. Read rec.games.abstract.

christianF&gt; If Mark ever develops a malignant brain tumor, it will blend in so perfectly that it won't even show up in an X-ray

MarkSteere&gt; lol, I don't get it but it's funny anyway

All kidding aside, I really do find Prodymple sickening.  I'm tired of recombined old game ideas which is all we're seeing now, and I'm fucking tired of Symple.  Luis' last two games were copy pasted.  First he ran off with my Tripen, adapting it from a Hex board to a square board.  The fact that he had to be pressured into grudgingly acknowledging the similarity (outside the rule sheet) doesn't bother me as much as just the fact that it's recycled.  

Then Luis became the third person (after Bill Taylor and Nestor the filthy plagiarist) to run off with Nick Bentley's Produto, without crediting Nick of course.  Now, as if three Produto rip-offs weren't enough, Christian Freeling has leapt into the fray with Prodymple.  At least Christian had the decency to credit Nick.

I am so tired of Symple.  There's nothing about Symple itself that's irksome.  Not even the fact that it's based on a complicated, inelegant, kludgy mechanism designed to balance an utterly opaque game.  It's the fact that Christian relentlessly touted Symple as "perfect", "quintessential", and "great".

Now Christian has moved into Phase II - blending the Symple mechanism with other existing games.  This isn't ordinary torture.  It's "please let me die" torture.

Finally we have Prodymple.  The over-copied Produto combined with the over-promoted Symple mechanism produces a nausea synergy where you can't stop dry heaving.
