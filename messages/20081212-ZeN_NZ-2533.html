It seems you are correct Mr. Anonymous.  But . . . I still don't
care.  The premise of mutually exclusive horizontal and vertical loops
on a torus is very obvious to anyone familiar with Hex and the 2D,
square depiction of a torus.  It jumps out at you like Alien spawn.
With scant investigation, the helical component eagerly reveals itself
as well.  It would be outlandish for either me or Bill to claim to be
the first to stumble onto these principles.  A skilled researcher
could undoubtedly uncover a number of textual references to the
mutually exclusive vertical/horizontal loops principle, including
Torben Mogensen's Torex announced here in r.g.a. in January 2008.  The
application of these principles to a game couldn't possibly be more
obvious to anyone involved in the art of connection game design.

The problem with ZeN/NZ is that being Quax based, it misses the boat
entirely.  It depends on awkward, inelegant "bridge" rules to fill the
board. The order of filling the board must be observed and the bridge
rules applied throughout.  Auto Quax, Quicky Quax and Quax Flambe all
suffer from this problem as well.  Bill thrashed the Quax bush so
thoroughly that the only thing left standing was the stump of the
obvious: the octagon/square tessellation.

My version of the torus game, which uses the octagon/square
tessellation, is a true win loss complementary, equal goals game in
which all possible connections can be formed randomly, in any order,
without restriction.  In fact in my version there simply <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>aren't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> any
connection rules, except that you claim any unoccupied cell on your
turn.  All adjacent cells are connected cells.  There's no need for
awkward, inelegant bridges.

Because of the obviousness of the torus game principles, and because
of the monumental simplification represented by playing the game on an
octagon/square tessellation (eliminating all placement order/
connection rules), and because it achieves the coveted win loss
complementary property - with totally random, rule independent board
filling - I'm still claiming my version of the torus game as my own.
