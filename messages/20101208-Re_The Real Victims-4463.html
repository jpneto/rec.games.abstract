Bill, I think the readership knows what your problem with the emails is.  
And it's not your ridiculous assertion that I've pestered your colleagues
with my "crackpot" self.   When one of your colleagues, Jan Evans-Freeman,
says "Thank you for alerting me to this... I have forwarded it to [Bill's]
head of department to follow up urgently," is that a euphemism for "Get away
from me, crackpot!"?  I don't think so.

Your other attempted diversion - that I embarrassed your colleagues by
posting their emails to rec.games.abstract is also ridiculous.  For one
thing, they didn't say anything even remotely embarrassing!  Are we to
believe, Bill, that my posting of your colleague Richard Brown's statement
"I can assure you that whatever's going on in your newsgroup is the action
of Bill alone, not our department or university," to rec.games.abstract
embarrassed him?  No, Bill.  It didn't embarrass Richard Brown.  It
embarrassed you!

Do you think we're stupid?
