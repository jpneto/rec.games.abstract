This is technically off-topic, but I've disappointingly received zero responses on rec.puzzles, so I thought I'd try posting it here.  The iOS app for BoxOff has been updated and now includes an interactive tutorial as well as 4 new puzzle packs.

BoxOff is a solitaire board game where the object is to clear all the stones off the board.  There is only one rule:  a same-colored pair may be removed if they share a rectangle containing no other stones.  In my opinion it has a complexity that is comparable to many 2-player games.

There is also a very nice Windows program for BoxOff written by Greg Schmidt.  It is part of his Axiom game system and is also available for Zillions.
