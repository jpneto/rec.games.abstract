<br>the very least, to work it out over the board.

<br>What you're doing is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>increasing<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the amount of memorization required to
<br>play good chess.&nbsp; By insisting that players keep going to the bitter end,
<br>you're turning chess into a competition to get into a known position and
<br>reel off the known winning/drawing moves.&nbsp; You're making people play a
<br>game of chess to what is currently felt to be its natural conclusion and
<br>then play a game of `pretend to be the computer' to decide who wins.&nbsp; 
Frankly, I don't see the point.

<br>I'm sure you are partly correct. But some sneaky bastards will be smart 
enough to take this 'known sewuence' and insert at just the right point 
a different move, and the other (first time he encounters it) will make 
his automatic move, and lose.
<br>
<br>Thus we make sure they all have to think carefully during their 
'automatic' sequence, hence not making it automatic anymore.
<br>The game plays on till a draw is truly inevitable.
<br>
<br>There's this rule about the three moves that are repeating that creates 
a draw. We need to get rid of that draw as well. Simply make it not be 
allowed to repeat a move after moving a piece back to it's original 
position. And yes, that will force players into a loss, thus making for 
less draws, and of course less positions that are agreed upon as being a 
draw.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Certain positions have been `proved' to be drawn by exhaustive computer

<br>computer programs.)&nbsp; You come up with the winning line and I'm sure we'll
<br>all cheer you as the saviour of chess.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I won't come up with it. I suck at memory games.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite>Since the majority of chess games end up a draw anyway, they might as 
well agree a draw right after the first move. Would that make it any
<br>better?
<br></blockquote>
<br>If that were the best strategy, don't you think more grandmasters would
<br>use it?
<br></blockquote>
<br>I'm amazed really how they sit there playing for 3 hours then agree to 
draw. I really think it's a waste of time.
<br>
<br>I'd rather lose trying to go for the win then waste my time getting a draw.
