If you aren't Mark Steere, this may not be interesting, but feel free to read anyway.

My initial impression of Redstone, from having played it twice now, is one of interest. Strategically, it's basically Go, but with a few twists. Tactically, it has an inherent system that I'm inclined to believe increases the depth of complexity quite a bit. This will have an impact on strategy, but I'm not entirely sure what yet.

One thing I haven't analysed in enough detail is life and death common shapes. In Go, there are a number of sequences, shapes, and combinations that are known to be even or good for one side. Some of these retain their qualities more or less in Redstone, some are turned upside down. That has some interesting effects. In Go, having 4 or 5 options that you can pick based on whole board circumstances makes the game interesting, and one in which enhanced knowledge bears fruit. If 1 or 2 of those options become non-options, this adjusts the breadth of "good play options", which sounds like Redstone would risk becoming the strategically weaker game. However, coupled with this is life and death. When someone allows their opponent to live in the corner in return for outside thickness, that's a strategic decision based on balancing outcomes. If that corner is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>also<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> dead because of Redstones capture mechanics, it's an outright good result for the person developing the thickness. As a result, a few joseki ideas and invasion ideas will suddenly become non-viable, and I suspect some of the strategic depth will increase again, most likely balancing out some of the other decreases.

Until there's a reasonable understanding of living shapes and dead shapes and sekis (notice there are no ko shapes in Redstone), it will be easier to assess what Redstone's strategy is like, but we aren't there yet. My game against illluck was an eye-opener, as I fabricated a living group out of thin air inside my opponent's territory. There are a number of hane / crosscut situations which simply don't work in Go, but do in redstone, as you can end up with eyes appearing out of nowhere when red stones hit the board. It's also clear that two point eyes are frequently not eyes at all, and single stone self atari sacrifice play has gained a lot of leverage.

All of this impacts my feeling on the desired board size. A few days ago, I said 15x15 would probably be ideal, and I still feel it's well worth trying out. However, the reason for 19x19 in Go is that the corner sequences are well understood, and the results of the sequences reasonably closely theorised. Make the board too small, and the sides are not interesting enough once the corners are played out. Make the board too big, and no corner sequence can exert enough influence on the sides to make the balance between corners and sides interesting. It's a funny tightrope, and it's not clear whether 21x21 may end up superior, but current professional opinion is still that it wouldn't.

In Redstone, I suspect the nature of captures will expand the value of influential plays, as kills seem more common and playable on internal eye shapes, particularly bulky ones. As a result, it may be more viable on a 19x19 board to play 3-5, 4-5, and 4-4 stones than corner orientated ones, and as the cause of this change would be the size of a group required to feel confident of life, it's possible that would mean that there's still not enough scope for side play on a 19x19 board, and an ideal board size would be more like 23x23 to maintain the strategic depth that Go enjoys.

As with anything deep and interesting, there's more questions here than answers, but that's some of my thoughts so far.

It certainly feels a very interesting variant, and I'd happily put it alongside Go for depth and value, but how deep that rabbit hole goes is still unanswered.
