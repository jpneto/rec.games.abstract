Introduction:

  Xong[tm] is an abstract game for 2 players or, in special arrangements,
  more players.  It is a Territory game.  Xong was invented in 1996.  I
  was trying to find out what the australian aborigine word for those
  dried-up lakes that make a tesselated caked mud surface and a friend
  was suggesting "billabong", which was a dried-up oxbow kind of thing
  and, POW just like that, the sport clothing line came out!  :-D  - so
  i have named my game Xong.  Xong is also a vietnamese word for the end
  of an exam when i google it, along with various proper names on other
  hits.  ==&gt; Pronounce that "zong".

  Where Go has been compared to an entire campaign of war and Chess,
  perhaps, to one of it's battles, Xong might then be analogous to a
  single swordfight down on the battlefield.  Typically Go games take
  hundreds of moves to determine a victor while chess may take 80 or so
  moves.  Xong takes around 31 moves.  I am not sure what this may have
  to do with the game's complexity.  I find the complexity quite enough
  to have kept me up long hours of the night working out variations.


Description:

  Xong is played with pieces, called Xoids, made out of the sides of
  hexagons, connected together in a rigid 2-dimensional form that are
  placed over vacant sides of a 2-d field of hexagons connected along
  their edges.  Each Xoid can only be used once.  In order to be a new
  Xoid, it cannot be rotated and/or flipped over into the shape of a Xoid
  already played.  As long as the Xoid can be placed over the board on
  only vacant legs, any Xoid shape is legal.  The object is to wall off
  more hexagons than your opponent with legs of your own color.  You
  neednt fill all 6 sides, but rather just make it impossible for your
  opponent to touch any of those 6 sides.  If both sides touch a hexagon
  it doesnt count for either player and is said to be "greened out".

  Xong is a position game, but there is no capturing.  Xong never gets
  into a repetitive impasse or deadlock.  However, Xong also has a defect
  in it's Ruleset:  at the end of play, when one player is unable to give
  a new Xoid to the other, instead, as a means of compensation, he gives
  1 point.  This prevents ties, but is philosophically an artificial
  construct outside of the geometry of the board &amp; piece patterns.  This
  is called the Xong point.

  You may have noticed i referred to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>giving<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> new pieces.  This is
  central to the operation of the game.  It is like baseball in that you
  give a piece to the other player to play.  Then after it is played,
  you are given back a new piece to play.  It's like hitting a pitch.
  Naturally, you want to give your opponent the piece that does the least
  damage to you.  The Xoids given begin with the smallest ones and
  gradually increase in size &amp; complexity until there is no more room on
  the board for any new piece.  Each piece can only appear once in a
  game.  Since secured hexagons are worth 2 points, at the end of the
  game one player will have an even score and the other will have an odd
  score including the Xong point.  Thus there cannot be a tie game.  And
  the gradual increase in size, with jumps located at the 2nd player's
  turn, have made this game similar to progressive Chess and also
  extremely neutral to the first or second player.

  There are currently 2 active versions of Xong - a Standard game of 61
  hexagons arranged in an order-5 hexagonal grid, and a Random variant
  that generates random boards of about 57-68 hexagons arranged in one
  blobby weird shape that is never the same way twice.  The random
  version might seem to violate the letter of law regarding abstract
  games by introducing an element of chance, but once the board is
  created, both players are in possession of 100% of the game
  information.  Nothing is hidden.  The Random variation was created to
  head off any stockpiling of memorized openings, such as has happened
  in Go and Chess.  Even Standard Xong already has an Audrey Gambit
  Declined opening.  The Standard game is still using an obsolete,
  slightly buggy java applet, so i wouldnt recommend trying it right now.


Some Elements of Strategy:

  At the beginning you give your opponent the smallest Xoids you can.
  There are 19 that touch 5 or less hexagons.  The 1st peice is just one
  leg, which touches 2.  You avoid double touching hexes you have already
  touched and you avoid touching the wall around the board which doesnt
  count for anybody.  The cold value of a move can be calculated by
  adding up how many new hexagons it touches for you, how many of yours
  it cashes (walls off) and how many of your opponent's hexagons it
  touches (greening out that hex for nobody).

  At some point, you may want to construct a long serpentine Xoid that
  can only fit around the outside edge where a lot of greened-out hexes
  are.  I've called these Wall-Crawlers.  They can suddenly crop up in
  the batting order around turns 15-25.  It is best to keep a good eye
  out for the conditions where they come into play.  A number of times
  you may give one of the 19 to your opponent and it will be placed in
  a way that creates a wall-crawler situation.

  I've also termed this general concept of the shrinking of possible
  playable places Habitat Extinction.  Often you can construct a piece
  that can only go in one place.  Once you have identified the salient
  leg shape that accomplishes this, you can then add other legs that
  block off access to your hexagons or ruin your opponent's niches by
  ballooning the niche into a place that can take many other Xoids than
  the one planned.  I call that process Festooning.

  Sometimes a sizeable area gets left behind as the players cannot bear
  to give the other a piece that fits in there for the score it will
  make.  They instead find wall-crawlers or similar awkward shapes that
  cannot go in there.  When this happens, i call it a Ko fight.
  Eventually someone will get to play in this vacant area, winning the
  Ko.

  Another development that can occur in the late going will be walling
  off a spot that only one new Xoid can fit in.  If your opponent gives
  you this piece you can play it in some other region of the board
  (tenuki) and then that seals the space as is!  So you can "remotely"
  cash some hexes in this manner.  Hence you will probably not be given
  this piece for awhile.  You can give it to your opponent if the remote
  cashing is favorable to you, because then to play it elsewhere works
  against the cold value for tenuki and to your advantage, while playing
  it in the spot may also be a low cold value.  There are other cases
  where a spot may have a different value depending on who plays in it.
  During the course of the game, you'll want to create as many of these
  asymmetrical spots as you can, as long as you're keeping up with all
  of the other things going on.

  As the game winds down to the end, there is often an opportunity to
  control who will have the last move.  Remembering that the player to
  gets the last move must then give the other the Xong Point, certain
  cool things can happen, if you are paying attention.


The Website as of now:

  I have a website with some java applets (j2sdk1.4.0_01 applets) for
  single workstation play.  There are new-window browser links to the 7
  rules, an example Standard game replayed with a java applet, a table
  of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the pieces, the buggy Standard game playing java applet
  and the newest state-of-the-art Random game playing java applet.  These
  playing applets automatically keep a running score &amp; shade in hexagons
  for each side, greening out hexes touched by both colors &amp; cashing
  hexes that are roped off as they occur during play.  The old Standard
  applet is buggy still and no longer supported for the current interim.
  The random version represents the best representation i have to offer
  at the moment and has fixed the bug that led to a rare occurance of
  faulty cashing during play.

  I still do not have a way to play against an opponent live over the net
  like the go &amp; chess servers do.  I am working on this and hope to
  unveil the world's first Internet Xong Server someday soon.  In the
  meantime, i can explain how to play over the net via email and the
  java appletviewer.  Just ask me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:greystone@net1plus.com">greystone@net1plus.com</a>.

  In order to play this on your web browser, you'll need to be able to
  run java applets, either via Java Web Start or by plugins within your
  browser.  Some browsers can get the applet running, but for some
  strange reason, despite all claims to the contrary in the java toolkit
  descriptions, the text comes out too small to read.  Perhaps screen
  resolutions finer than 1024x768 lead to this.  perhaps some font files
  may be damaged.  Xong applets use Helvetica which is a pretty standard
  default font.  I developed it on my Linux side and can view it fine
  there as well as in my Mozilla browser on my Windows XP side.  A
  brother of mine can view it on a Mac.  If you are firewalled off from
  the outside world with applets, then perhaps i can work out the email
  solution.


Invitation:

  You are welcome to check out Random Xong at:


     <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/xonghome.html">http://users.net1plus.com/greystone/xong/xonghome.html</a>


  Scroll down to the bottom and click the Random Xong link.  This should
  open a new browser window so you can do other things and keep this
  active on the sidelines.

  But you should also view the Example Game just to get a quick heads-up.
  The commentary in it is ancient.  But there are still some points.

  I would like to know if you have any problems AND if you dont
  seem to have any problems.  Feedback <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> way is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>good<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.
