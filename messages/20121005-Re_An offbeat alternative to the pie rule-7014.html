(I'm not sure if this is a typo, but, just in case, one piece isn't enough. You should be able to move any or all of them.)



The balancing mechanism featured in Shintai is very interesting, but I'm not sure if it's more elegant than Connect6. After all, you have you keep track of how many stones have been placed after the last "shintai" move.

Well, I didn't mean that Shintai was more elegant than Connect6, it's definitely not. However, Connect6 is definitely also not Gomoku, as the gameplay is significantly different. For Shintai, my aim was to make the simplest material balancing mechanism possible, while still keeping the general Gomoku framework in place - I think I did end up making the most balanced Gomoku variant yet, but Connect6 trumps it in simplicity for sure.

It's not a typo - I would only move one at first, and see how the balance plays out. You may have noticed that I didn't say any adjacent point.

White: Concede material advantage in exchange for one powerful move.
Black: Lose material advantage to prevent a single powerful move from White..

If you were able to move all of your pieces with the special move, I have a hunch that it stops becoming special and wouldn't effectively balance the game. Each player would be afraid of the massive shift afforded by the move, and might trigger it too early for it to do any true balancing (just to keep their opponent from doing it next).
