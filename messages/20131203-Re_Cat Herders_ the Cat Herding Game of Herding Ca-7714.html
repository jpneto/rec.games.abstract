This looks like fun.  My wife is a Grumpy Cat fan and I'll show her the game when she gets home :)

The theme is playful and non-serious, but I wonder if this game would actually be fairly deep if played on a large grid.  Some games scale well, and some do not.  Have you tried it on a big board?

You mentioned in your rules that Cat Herders can be played on grids other than hexagonal.  I had a thought:  What if it were played on a square grid with the following rule: a cat may move orthogonally or diagonally, but a herder can only move orthogonally.  This would simulate the fact that cats are slippery little customers and can dart in and out.  Don't know if this idea would work in practice, though.
