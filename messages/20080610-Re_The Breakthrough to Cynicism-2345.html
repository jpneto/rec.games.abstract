Fair enough, but I don't think in this day and age the fact that you're
mail ordering from Quebec, Canada or somewhere in NL or wherever is
actually a major barrier compared to ordering from some bit of the US
you don't live in.  International shipping really isn't that exceptional
any more.

Right, but the language barrier is significant. I searched the net a
long time for 10x10 boards, and on boardgamegeek forums you also see
several other people asking for it. Right now, I suspect most people
who don't speak French, Dutch or Russian will never find a board
online, even if they go looking for it.

I suppose this really means that the International Draughts community,
despite the name of the game, make very little effort to market the
game outside their individual countries.
