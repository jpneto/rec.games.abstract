This is clearly a blow to my idea.  But I don't think it would make
much practical difference.  What I am imagining is a three-player
variant of chess (BTW -- has anyone seen such a critter?) in which all
draws are three-way, so that teaming up cannot accomplish much.  Your
example shows that in a N-player game, if Player 1 chooses poorly the
advantage goes to Player N.  The same holds true for the 2-player
version.  Presumably, Player 1 is trying to win and hence will not
knowingly make a move which gives a major advantage to any color. 
Whether that is in practice possible is of course the test of whether
or not this method is actually an equalization.

I also am suspicious of your hypothesis.  What can it conceivably mean
to say both that the chances of victory are independent of the second
move and that they are equal to (Blue 70%, Red 20%, Yellow 10%)?  In a
2-player setting, of course, that would be nonsense; the theoretic
chance of winning in a given position is either 0 or 100%.  And it is
quite unlikely early on that that chance is independent of the move
selected.  I cannot see how an N-player game is likely to change this
latter fact.  (Of course I don't have a very good grasp of the
stategies involved in N-player games.)  I suppose I could imagine that
there might be positions in which the best efforts of two players
cannot defeat a third one, but if that is the case from early on, the
game wouldn't be very interesting.
