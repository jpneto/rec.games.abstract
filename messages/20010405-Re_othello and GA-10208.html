I tested my program with a teacher first. I mean I had a sample program
which plays othello (but not so good :(( ) .
So my population played games with this teacher. So I had clear fitness
function. I could also see
non - relatively (definitely) if my population grows up or not. Of course I
can not reach more than just a teacher can play.
So I want to eliminate outside teacher. I tried to put a best chromosome
(the one who won all games with previous teacher)
as a teacher and repeat testing. Problem is that every teacher is diffrent
(maybe better) so I cannot compare results to see progress.
I try again with position from initial game to endgame as you wrote.

It sounds like you are selecting only one for the others to play against.
It would probably give you better results to schedule a round-robin style
tournament and chose your breeding stock from the top scorers plus a
few chosen at random. The random start positions are a good idea also, although
I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to create new ones only once per
generation to keep good players from being eliminated by hopeless positions.
