lol, It's only logical.  If everyone's having such a hard time with judges
we all accept...  Christian now wants future contests to be judged by pack
animals.  What next??  I was hoping to distinguish this contest from a
typical bgg contest with quality.  Better quality.

Btw, I squabble with Christian but, just for the record, I'm glad he's here.
 Basically, if you look at the timeline, Christian Freeling replaced Bill
Taylor.  The impact of that is staggering.  Quite simply, rec.games.abstract
is now relevant and before it was not.

And I hold Christian in high regard, even when he's complaining incessantly.
 Bill Taylor, in comparison, isn't fit to lick a clump of shit off the back
of Christian Freeling's boot heel.  Harald Korneliussen has to scrape it
off, dip it in white chocolate, and feed it to Bill Taylor (after
blindfolding him and stroking his nipples of course).

Christian has added two of my games to MindSports - Oust and Monkey Queen. 
How many of my games has Bill Taylor added to his game site?  Wait a
minute...  Bill Taylor doesn't even have a game site!  Bill Taylor doesn't
have shit!!

Thanks Nate  :)  I don't have many fans, but I wouldn't trade them for all
the me-tooers on bgg.
