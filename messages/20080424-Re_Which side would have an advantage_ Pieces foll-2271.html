This should be very easy to check. All chess programs worth a penny
let you set up arbitrary positions, from your description, that
would be sufficient (when setting up a king on the second row, it
naturally won't be able to castle, and a pawn on the third row won't
be able to move to the fifth). Take a seriously strong program, make
it play without an opening book, and see which side wins more often.

Actually, you don't need to disable the opening book -- no opening
book will contain any of the positions that arise in the first twenty
or so moves of this game so having the opening book switched on will
make no difference.  This is just the same as your observation that
castling and double pawn moves don't need to be explicitly disabled.

Ok, so it looks like Near and Near vs Normal are two variants that can
be played with just about any chess program by reconfiguring the
starting positions.  Well, Near Chess is ALMOST near chess, due to the
pawn promotion rules.  Call it SM Near Chess then (SM standards for
Slightly Modified, and Scheming Mind, which is likely one of the first
sites to have it up with the normal chess pawn promotion rules).
