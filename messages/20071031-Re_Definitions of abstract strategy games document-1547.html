Yet there's plenty of that in your initial document.  What I'm asking is
why you need that level of detail in your definition of an abstract
strategy game?  Who does it help?

Would you rather the categorization of the games be called: "Chatrang
Variants"?

No, because it doesn't tell me anything without considerable further
reference work on my part.  "Chess and its cousins" if you don't like
"chess variants", perhaps?
"Cousin" works both ways, it doesn't imply either cousin is superior to
the other.

The World Chess and Its Cousins Champion?  Not sure that sounds right.

If someone is going to play a series of chess like games, for a range
of games derived from Chatrang, please come up with what you feel
would be a better name for that category of games.
