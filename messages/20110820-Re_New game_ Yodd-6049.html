I never imagined that coining the term game architecture would cause such a
ruckus.  People have expressed curiosity over the years about "how I do it"
- believe it or not.  I never pretended to have a precise definition for
game architecture.  It's just a term I use to sum up how I look at game
design.  The rule set as something to behold.  With an emphasis on
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>organics<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  When I first saw that term, I was like, Wtf?  Then I realized,
Oh yeah - that's what the fuck I do.  Organic design.

Originality is central of course.  Maybe that's what makes architecture such
a burr in Christian's bikini.

Game architecture must seem a little "Emperor" like to some, lol  
Especially to those who can never see it.
