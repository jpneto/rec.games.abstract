Interesting! What's the algorithm, standard alpha-beta? I suspect
you'd need more skill than I have at visualizing 4D space to defeat
the program. (Has anyone done so yet?)

There's no look-ahead,  I figured the branching was too much
(625 first moves).  The The algorithm for rating a move is
that it assigns a "score" for each row that the square includes
and just adds them.  I didn't try to hard to optimize what the
"scores" were, I just wanted to make sure that the "score"
for a row that already contains 4 of your guys is much higher than
anything else (so the computer iswill win if it can),  the score
for a row with 4 of the enemy's guys is high enough that it will
block your attempts at winning, and so on.  A row that has
at least one of each type already is worth nothing,  but an
empty row is worth a little so it will preferentially make moves
that are part of more rows.  The center square is part of
40 different rows!

Not yet, although I had it on the run for about 20 moves until I hurried a
move and got blindsided. Generally, though, I'm playing total defense. It
seems that the limitation is that whenever you make an offensive move, the
computer pretty easily gets to block it at the far end or middle. In 3dTTT
or 2dTTT your opponent doesn't have that much time to stop your strategy.
I'm willing to bet that there are fewer ways to win this (total games) than
there are in 3dTTT.

There are an awful lot of rows.  Let's see,  there are 500 "straight"
wins,  I think 300 "diag-1's",  4 * 5 * 4 "diag-2's" and 8 "diag-3s"
(diag-1 means keeping 2 dimensions constant,  diag-2 keesp
1 constant,  and diag3 0).
