It's a great idea for a game!  But alas it fails where all
attempts to construct continuous-region games fail - it is,
ultimately, an ill-defined game, which means an undefined game.
To define it properly, one would have to cover the board with
pixel-like cells to determine unambiguously what was connected
to what, (which is probably done in the screen implewmentation!),
which just makes it a grid game again, with an enormous grid.

It would be an intriguing game-design challemge (HELLO NICK!),
to design a game which was "clearly" a connection game "in spirit",
but had no grid at all!  I'm not sure how one could go about it
in view of the remarks above, but there seems no a priori problem.

Depends how you define "ill-defined".


We've played the game many times and it works in the real world. We use
poker chips on a small coffee table. There is no guessing if two pieces are
connected -- when placing a piece, the moving player <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>states<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that they are
touching and marks them as so by placing another poker chip directly over
the point where they kiss. (Matchsticks could be used as well.)


But of course you are right. Though placement that connects a new piece to
ONE other piece or a goal can always be handled unambiguously, that is NOT
always the case when placing (or sliding) a piece between two other pieces
or a piece and the goal. A real world judgment has to be made and agreed
upon by the players. "Touching" only really exists in mathematics.

Well, there's no denying the Atoll idea is a good one
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


The 1975 book "Mudcrack Y and Poly Y" by Craige Schensted &amp; Charles Titus
has the rules for "Poly-Join" ("Join" being their name for standard Hex)
which is played on a board with 4x goals. The rules are identical to Atoll
with different win criteria. They interpreted the object of Hex (Join)
differently. Rather than "connect your goals" or "connect the opposite sides
of the board", they saw it as joining goals into as few groups as possible.
On a standard Hex board, there is no difference. On an 8 or more sided
poly-join board it isn't.


If the diagram below were a game of Atoll, White has won. If it were a game
of Poly-Join, Black has won by reducing her goals to two groups while White
has three.

In this next example, given on page 181 of their book, by the rules of
Poly-Join, "*" wins by a score of 3 to 4, having reduced her 6 goals to 3
groups. In this case, she also wins by the rules of Atoll or (Modified)
Free-Y. If cell #1 were to belong to "." rather than "*", "*" would LOSE the
game of Poly-Join while the results of Atoll would be unchanged.

Poly-Join may be longer than Atoll on the same boards; more so as the number
of goals is increased.


Poly-Join is to Atoll as Go is to Gonnect.


(By the way, the first sentence in their description of Poly-Join is
"Poly-Join is a generalization of Join".)

the case of "Free Y"
shows - this is clearly a connection game, but there are NO
personally-owned areas at all!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Played on an ODD board (one with a odd number of cells in the perimeter)
this is the case.

Played on an Evenly Even board (4x perimeter cells) as above, you need the
ring of goal areas with a half-cell twist.

Oddly Even boards (2x+2 perimeter cells) won't work as it is possible for
both players to have simultaneous winning paths and you've got a race game.
