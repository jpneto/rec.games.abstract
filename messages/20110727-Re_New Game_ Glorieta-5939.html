En España, la palabra "glorieta" es de uso corriente. Debemos de estar
anticuados... :-P

Now seriously, it looks like a great improvement on Coil. Also:

This sentence inspires me a little drawless game:

- Players take turns to place stones of their own color (Black or
White) on vacant cells.
- When a loop of stones of any color (Black, White or both) is formed,
the player with more stones in it wins. In case of a tie, the playing
completing the loop loses.
- A loop is defined as the smallest subset of a chain of stones which
surround at least one cell.

In case you're interested, I once mentioned here a game of mine (Vogo)
which used this mechanism to claim territories. Unfortunately, I felt
it was too easy to prevent the opponent from making territories, but I
fixed it long ago with the forced use of neutral stones which could be
part of them. I didn't publish this revised version out of apathy or
insecurity, I guess. Maybe I should reconsider it.
