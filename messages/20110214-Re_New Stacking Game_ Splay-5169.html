I have posted the rules along with an Axiom PC game which allows both
human and computer play.

If you're reading this message and have already downloaded these
files, please download them once again as I have recently made some
corrections to the game instructions.

Thank you.

This is a nice game.  I played the Axiom program several times and I
like the general feel.  It took me two games to realize that
interfering with your own towers is just as bad as allowing your
opponent to collapse your towers.  I like the balance between starting
new towers on the board and strenthening existing towers.  My only
criticism is that the long-range influence of pieces seems to be
minimal and thus strategizing seems difficult; however this is not a
big problem because of the relatively small board size you have
chosen. From a tactical standpoint this game is interesting and a lot
of fun.  Good work!
