"The" philosophy for designing games? From on high? Listen pal, you're deluded. You're in no place to even be publishing personal musings about philosophy on designing games, never mind the definitive one.

If you believed this you wouldn't accuse people of running off with your idea for Hex with bisected cells which was barely more than a conversation piece.

Before you were kissing Luis' ass, what happened to those days? I doubt you are going to find a friend here even from the less reactionary elements on RGA. I'm sure Luis is as sick of your shit as anyone else just too polite and sensible to involve himself in this farce. Hazen you're like a sideshow attraction, a midget they throw into a wrestling ring to have his ass kicked before the main event. You aren't just punching above your weight, you aren't even in a weight class to begin with.

Why are you trying to put "absurd constaints" on games?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">



these "absurd constaints" as you so eloquently put it are there to give game designing some structure. You counted yourself a fan of Luis and he deals in "absurd constaints". When you don't have absurd constaints you end up designing something ridiculous like Blokus.

A game could be easy to master but with 10.000 of was to win. If the game is fun then where is the problem. Any language is composed with words syntax and so on but anyone interesting can change the way you talk. Nothing is eternal.

I'm tired of listening to people characterize the concept of "fun" as somehow remote from the competitive aspects of an abstract game. Hazen maybe you find clipping clothespins to you labia fun, that's not the sort of fun an abstract game is supposed to provide. Its supposed to be an intellectual interactive challenge.

A game with cycles? why not yes if the goal of the game is to try to solve the cycles. When a cycle occur the 2 players try to solve it. What is really a problem is that only one of the players can force the cycle. If one of the players can break it then it is not a cycle. Building a game on cycles is a big challenge. Any rule used to prohibit the cycle for example is the kind of "botched" solution. It take time to find the right rule.

we also didn't realize practically acyclic games existed either, thanks for pointing it out...

Well perhaps you would directly like to address those "botched solutions" created by your pal Luis or his use of the "botched" solution in Crossway and Slither. Like I said, don't think that anyone here accepts your presence as anything more than the unfortunate circumstance of a forum without moderation. If there were moderators here like there are at xkcd you would have been banned in advance. Even Mark tried to symbolically ban you. Hazen, buddy, you just don't get it, you suck, please go away and never return (kind of like you promised you would).

Schakovitz aka Clarkrappy,

I read some of your posts. You are mentally ill dumb and racist.
Why are you insulting Luis?
Look at your Slither no one want to play it.
It is a crappy crapipi game.
What is new on the game?
NOTHING!!!
People who are not dumb prefer to play Hex rather than your crappy game.
Only the maffiosi-game-designers like you are rating well your game.
I defend your game and you defend my game that is what a gang of crappy designers are doing : congratulating one another.

YOU ARE FAKE DESIGNERS (DES IMPOSTEURS!!!).
