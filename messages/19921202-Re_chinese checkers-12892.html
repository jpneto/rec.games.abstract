Last night my 9-year-old pretty much conceded loss and kept his playing
piece in my home until he had no other move except his home pieces.  Is
this actually legal?  Except for his blockage, I would have won.  He was
pretty pleased to thwart my efforts, if he couldn't win.

No, this is illegal.   (It might be a good idea to stay flexible on this
issue in your position, however.)

I have a rules question of my own.  The rules that came with the set 
I have been using say that multiple jumps must be in a straight line
(no zig-zags).  I've never played that way, though, and neither has
anyone else I've talked to.  Does anyone out there use this rule?

Does anyone know if there is a set of "official" rules, and if so, 
who decides them, and what they are?

And just out of curiosity, what is this game called in Chinese (or
other languages)?
