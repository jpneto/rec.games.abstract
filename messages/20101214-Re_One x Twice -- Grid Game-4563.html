I've had a certain problem most of my life,
though it seems to be getting worse lately.

Thank you.

I don't think in words; ignored Leroy's 1/2 distinction as soon as
I realized it was irrelevant; used "Odd" all by myself as an
abbreviation for "Player who seeks Odd total"; forgot to clarify
when I changed my thoughts back into English for posting here.

I don't blame quasi, as I've been having this problem in
almost 99% of the threads where I post lately.   :-(

But just out of curiosity, would you have troubled to take
the time to figure out "what James must have intended" if
you'd known a priori that James is "a very bright guy"?  :-)

Sure, except I'm always low on time these days. 

I automatically interpreted the player you called "Odd" as the one
with who wins on an odd move, i.e. Player 1. It didn't occur to me
that by "Odd", you meant the player who wins on an odd total, i.e.
Player 2. Had I read your reply more carefully, I would have seen that
your players were the switched versions of mine. 

Thus, it was my error, not yours -- sorry.
