This ain't the right group. Puzzles of this sort are fun, but not very
abstract. Go directly to rec.puzzles, do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

Righto.  However, if anyone is interested in Situation Puzzles, I
have a listing of 79 of them and their solutions, so mail me if you
want it.  Post puzzles in rec.puzzles AFTER reading the FAQ there.
(Look for FAQs in news.answers; they're easier to ferret out there.)

I know ya'll know this, but nobody's said it this week for newbies:
Rec.games.abstract is for the discussion of games without hidden or
random factors, commonly described as games which take "a moment to
learn, a lifetime to master."  These would include games like chess,
othello(reversi), noughts and crosses, checkers, TwiXT, mancala and
variants, and many others.  Some of these have their own newsgroups.
In an abstract game, each player has equal information (ie complete)
and there are no dice or other random elements.  Pure strategy. . .
