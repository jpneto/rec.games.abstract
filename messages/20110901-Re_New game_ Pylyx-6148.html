I quote from the rules:
"Player Two next decides whether he wants to move first, in which case
Player One chooses color, or play with a particular color, in which
case Player One moves first.

So yes, if Player Two wants to play first, Player One decides color.
You can't have it both ways. It may not be a pie, but it is a
balancing mechanism. Of course it is open to prepared opening
positions.

In 19th century France there was a Draughts player who had devised a
very cunning endgame that survived as "the position of the Marquis".
It provided a similar choice. He knew to handle it from both sides and
his bet was that he would win. And of course he often did. Nowadays
you could find the correct play with a smartphone :)

Here's a dutch link - it's rather obscure, even for Draughts:

Anyway, that's what it is, more or less. Nothing new and it works fine
in actual play.

Regarding 'generic herding': it's not difficult to isolate a single
with a wider enclosure, but it's far more difficult to keep other
pieces from getting in. I'm aware of the concept, but not convinced it
harbors a big problem. There aren't that many pieces to use in a
herding strategy.
