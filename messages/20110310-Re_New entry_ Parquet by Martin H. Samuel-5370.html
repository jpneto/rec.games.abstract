that's right :).  It might be harder to get into the contest after
tonight though.  I've organized a games night tonight at a friend's
house specifically for this contest, and I'll be bringing them to the
Dresden juggling convention this weekend hoping to get potential
players of every game.

 From the rules concerning movement:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A piece is moved in an advancing direction to an unoccupied adjacent tile or,
it may leap diagonally over another piece to an unoccupied tile immediately beyond.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Advancing = towards one's own rear rank goal?  Is the restriction like
the non-attacking baby in Monkey queen has to the opponent's queen?
Or must you always advance in rank with every movement regardless of
lateral distance?

Adjacent = both diagonal and straight? ie is a diagonal movement
without a jump allowed?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Players alternately either move or leap one piece at a time to an unoccupied tile then
slide an unoccupied tile orthogonally to an adjacent void ... or, slide an unoccupied tile
orthogonally to an adjacent void then move or leap a piece.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Otherwise, sounds good.  If anyone else sees the answer to my
questions.  ie. they're obviously explained and I'm just reading
wrong.
let me know!  And the sooner the better.

Daniel
