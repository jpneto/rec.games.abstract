I elect myself Arbiter of Style, and award game, set and match to
Crimson.  Crimson was speaking for all of us, I think, with the
observation that "I lost my marbles earlier in the game."

Obviously this theme has struck a chord with many of the readers.  It's
reminiscent of "Calvin Ball" (from the Calvin &amp; Hobbes cartoon, by
Waterson (sp?)), and Mornington Crescent (from ?).  For those who
aren't familiar with Calvin and Hobbes, the only permanent rule to
Calvin Ball is that you can't play it the same way twice.  I won't try
to sumarize Mornington Crescent, except to note that the first player
to say "Mornington Crescent" wins.

Other examples of this sort of game:  TEGWAR - "The Exciting Game
WIthout Any Rules" (objective: To convince bystanders that it IS a real
game); something from a star trek episode; the poker varient in Robert
Asprin's Myth Series; and many more I'm sure.

This being rec.games.abstract, why doesn't somebody draw up rules that
would have moves like those quoted above for a real game?  Something
that would give direction and goal to the game...  while rewarding
creativity and silliness :-).

(And, seriously, I really do think Crimson's move was the best played
of the above.  Runner up:  White's second move.  The Arbiter of Style
has spoken!).
