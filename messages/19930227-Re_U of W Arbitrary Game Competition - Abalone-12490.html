Greetings!

In article <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:1993Feb25.150340.2987@news.sara.nl">&lt;1993Feb25.150340.2987@news.sara.nl&gt;</a> <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:a512hjal@diamond.sara.nl">a512hjal@diamond.sara.nl</a> (;;diamond) writes:

Q: Why do you want to include both the head and the tail in
your notation for line/push moves? this is implicit by the rules!

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Abalone was discussed before in this newsgroup, and supposedly the notation
I specified is the standard of the international group that organizes things
like Abalone tournaments. Thus, I decided to try to stick to their notation.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Q: Does the program HAVE to support the notational convention
you described (and how would this work, with a text file exchanged
between the programs or differently?), or is it OK to just submit
a program with a decent graphical interface as well?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It would make life a lot easier for the people who have to run the programs
if a consistent notation is accepted and outputted by all the programs in
the competition. By all means, have a nifty graphics interface :-), but
please also use the notation.

Q: Is a Macintosh in your eyes a 'normal' computer, and if so,
how powerful a Mac would you use to run the program on?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I think we can run it on a Macintosh II/FS (I am not quite sure of the
designations of these machines. I will try to send more information via
e-mail).

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
R: The Macintosh program I made can relatively easy be used to
incorporate new strategies. (This would mean implementing the 
strategy in C as a "BoardJudgeProc", a function with the board,
the current player and the recursion level as input, and a numeric
value as the result, put it in the source and recompile; a standard
minimax strategy is used to find the move the BoardJudgeProc
thinks best. The program in is written in MPW C. Three strategies
are currently included, so it should be relatively easy to get
started, provided you have a Mac and MPW or Think C.)
If anyone is interested in the source code for the program, please
let me know. The program I posted on the net is just the program
(not the source code) and I put a copyright notice in it.
I'm willing to give the source code to anyone interested in it,
provided it's for use in this tournament, not to make a shareware
or commercial version of the program.
I think this competition is a nice idea, and I probably will join it,
if I can find the time to update the program to support you notation
(if I have to).
