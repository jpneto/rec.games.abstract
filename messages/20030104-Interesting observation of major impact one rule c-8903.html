Someone recently ported my game Groups over to Zillions:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/7537/groups.htm">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/7537/groups.htm</a>

The port can be found at:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Groups.html">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/Groups.html</a>

I had been playing it and found that it eventually bogged down with
defensive play.  I wanted to speed it up some, so I added a rule that
a piece was allowed to jump over another piece to an empty space.  I
thought this would open the game up more.

What I had found is that the game grew immensely more dynamic, and
much more offensive, and finished a LOT faster.  What would go on from
30 turns for a game usually now finished up in under 10.  The play
balance seems the same now, but the game is a lot faster.

Another side effect is that the basic king's move version, adding the
jump move, greatly improved Zillion's ability to play the game.  What
was a hopeless cause regarding Zillions, now has the AI putting up a
fight.

Anyone else have examples of a rules change like this greatly
impacting things?
