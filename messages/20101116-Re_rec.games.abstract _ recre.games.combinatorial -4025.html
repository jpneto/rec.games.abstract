Now what does Mediocrity want:

- That everything coming from anyone not respecting Mediocrity should
be viewed with the utmost suspicion.
- That having thoughts should qualify as thinking.
- That all opinions should be considered equal.
- That no-one should try to rise above Mediocrity.
- That calling a spade a spade is offensive.
- That offensive behaviour towards Mediocrity should not be tolerated.
- That discussing perceived offensive behaviour has the highest
priority, especially if it points away from the subject matter at
hand.
- And company: Mediocrity craves Company.

Great, now we have our own personal David Icke! Really Christian it's
time to close the book on this high school science project of yours.
Did you test the PH levels of rec.bile.insult? Their off the map!!!
But really what the fuck are you talking about? Mediocrity!
Rec.bile.insult is mediocre, at best. No, there's no post too stupid,
inane, pointless or absurd for RBI. Now that's mediocre. I mean  You
old guys in your ivory towers! It's hilarious what you come up with.
Equating respect with mediocrity is just so unbelievably dopey. I
should just drop Bill Taylor like a hot potato before we incur anymore
collateral damage. Would that make you happy Christian? I guess Nick
Bentley's pretty mediocre too, he doesn't have dozens of games either.
Okay so he's out. Oh and of course, how could I be so stupid, myself!
I'm the one hit wonder! All I did in my life is make Particle Bond! Oh
woe is me... Okay cya internet, it's been fun!
