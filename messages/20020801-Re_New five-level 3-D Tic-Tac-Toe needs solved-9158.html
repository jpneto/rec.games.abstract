James, please post the moves of one of the games you've played over
the years so that we may follow along and see how the winning player
forces the win.

Well since it's five levels, the ability of the first player to mount a
defense by using offense seems to be the neutralizing force. There are an
equal number of secondary value spaces of 16, which is analgous to the
opening moves of a chess game. Then the game really starts, which means the
players both have the same strategic positioning. This 8 piece matrix must
be worked with to create a fork.

Secondary value spaces of 16? Say what now? I may have missed
something .. I was busy working with my 8 piece matrix ...

When play gets up into 50 or 60 moves, the 5x5x5 matrix reveals it's
superiority from the 4x4x4 martix, in providing the three dimensional win
sequences. That is where the completion of a row forces the opponent plus
completes the second of a dual 3-way fork making the next move the
completion of the fork. This is kind of like a 3 move checkmate.

If this is true, please demonstrate -- post a game in which this
happens.

Again, unless one player continually gets extra-turns, these forks you
speak of cannot appear in a game between wide awake players.

At 62 moves, half the cells will be filled. Long before this point is
reached, each of the 109 rows will contain at least one of each
players pieces. Game over.

You claim this game is superior to the 4x4x4 game. Although 4x4x4 has
been solved and is a first person win, there is no obvious or
automatic way for a human player to do this -- so the game is still
playable, especially if one uses a 3-move-equalization or other pie
type rule. Bigger does not imply better; in this case, just more
tedious. 

Again, I challenge you to a play game -- you go first and take the
first 3 moves unopposed (or 4 moves with no free cell) and I will
easily force a draw.

This is not to say that the game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be playable in certain
contexts, for example, if you are playing 10 second per move. Or as
you suggest, it could be good for kids -- it won't be obvious for
several games is a draw. (LOTS of games out there are actually either
easy wins or forced draws once you've discovered the key.) Or if you
experiment with different rules -- off the top of my head, for
instance, vastly increase the number of 'free' cells, or allow 2 non
co-linear moves per turn, or provide for some type of captures, or
increase the board size.

I do stand corrected on the number of winning combinations. I had errantly
taken the number of wins per plane by the number of planes = 252, not
accounting for overlap!. Now I think it is more like 75 straight lines + 20
diagonals + 4 transversals = 99?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There are 30 2d diagonals, not 20. Each 5x5 has two. There are 5 5x5s
in each of 3 orientations. 2x5x3=30.

Many of us know the feeling of sitting down with what at first seems
to be an interesting new game, having our interest increase, only to
find that the game has a fatal flaw that allows a novice to draw
against a grandmaster.


One way to look at the problem: There aren't enough possible winning
rows. 125 cells, only 109 rows. Compare to Go Moku: 225 cells, 462
possible rows of 5.

The average number of potential winning rows through each cell of a Go
Moku board is 12.71. (This is misleading, since most of the play takes
place in the central region, so that average rows per cell in those
cells actually used in a typical game will be quite close to 20.)

Number of rows of five through each of 
the 225 cells of a 15x15 Go Moku board:
3  4  5  6  8  8  8  8  8  8  8  6  5  4  3
4  6  7  9 11 11 11 11 11 11 11  9  7  6  4

On a 5x5x5 board, the average number of potential 
winning rows through each cell is only 4.15.

Number of rows of five through each of the 125 cells (d=13):
