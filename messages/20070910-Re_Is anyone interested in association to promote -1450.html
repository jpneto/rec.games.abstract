The main difficulty that springs to mind is numbers.  On the Internet
it seems like there are a lot of us abstract gamers and there are a
lot of us.  But percentagewise we barely exist if game clubs are any
indication.  There are a number of such clubs in California.  I was
enthused about my new game (at the time) Cephalopod and, since it
hadn't been programmed for online play yet, I got the brilliant idea
of taking it to a game club.  At the first one I went to, admittedly a
small one, nobody wanted to play.  Instead we spent the evening
playing a Carcasonne-like game.  At one point when I brought up the
topic of Cephalopod, one lady said she liked every kind of game except
abstract games.  Judging from the blank stares and nodding heads she
seemed to be speaking for the group.  It was unanimous.

I think you will run into this a lot.  The end result is the
association may end up being mostly internet based.  The idea is to
have sufficiently large numbers that it is worthwhile, and also
produce a tournament structure that has abstracts as a category that
people compete in as a collective whole.  You don't just have it so
that you master one game, but are a master of many.  In this would fit
chess variants.  Due to a single game not being able to build up a
critical mass, you attempt to build them up collectively.

Later I found a much larger club.  Every game being played had some sort of colorful
colorful theme such as vampires, coal miners, space monsters . . . you
get the idea.  I did actually manage to play Cephalopod a couple of
times, after suffering though the worlds longest game of Vampires at
Night (I forget the actual name).  I began to wonder what would happen
if the sun were to actually come up in real life.  Interest in
Cephalopod dropped off pretty quick.  The stacks of picture cards,
move cards, animated story lines, 14 page rule books written in fine
print that required a PhD to fully understand, etc. were all torture
for me.  I learned my lesson.  Percentagewise "second class citizens"
would be a high honor.  In reality it's more like "abstract who?".

There are people who play games for competitive reasons.  And a lot
who are theme driven.  People tend to go with themes, but not all.

Anyhow, I believe there is hope, if people work together here.  A
possibility will to come up with a standard set of equipment for group
members to have, and then games get designed around this standard set
of equipment.
