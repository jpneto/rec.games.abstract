As far as i see, that is heavily in favour of pie rule, so i'm not
sure where you thought the analysis failed.

I didn't, rather I just wanted to provide more color/cotext for it.
The main difference between havannah and hex is point two. Draws <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
occur in havannah, albeit mostly in the large number of base-4 bot
versus bot games. As far as human play is concerned, draws play no
role in the decision making.

Another difference is scalability. Hex is 'infinitely scalable', but
in havannah the relations between ring, bridge and fork change,
because the lengths of the latter two change where rings are
invariant.

Lastly, separation, non-existent in hex, plays a big role in havannah.
Have a look at "Ring von Fehler" against "Castro" in this game:

which is discussed at the bottom of this thread:

White has a frame and what seems to be a winning position.

So I think your arguments are excellent, but at the same time a game
not wholly fulfilling your criteria, benefits in the same degree from
the pie than hex. I thinks that's noteworthy.

My center opening move in havannah is part lazyness. In fact it is a
bit too weak and when someone offers it I usually decline. If I offer
it and my opponent declines, I'm not quite comfortable with it. But it
beats choosing between a number of delicate options close to the
middle of a side.

P.S. How did you arrive at such precise percentages in MQ (i.e. 75%
and 72%). Certainly, considering the number and variety of the games
played so far, they cannot be more that very rough estimates?
