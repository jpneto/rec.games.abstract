  There I was, there I was, there I was
  Scribbling around with pen and paper, when I sort of came up with a 
  new (to me) game. It has some of the flavour of sprouts, and I haven't
  analyzed it much yet, but here it is:

    The board: A MxN rectangle of dots.         
    The play : Players alternate making moves, last one able to move wins
    A move: A move in this game consists of drawing a straight line 
       connecting two (previously untouched) dots. The line may not cross
       any previously drawn line, nor can it pass thru one dot on the way
       to another. Each dot can have at most one line touching it.

  The 3x3 game is trivial, and at 4x4 it starts to get a bit interesting. I
  think it would become playable 6x6 and up.  

  My (limited) analysis: Like sprouts, you know the maximum length of the
    game will be INT(MN/2) moves. Also like sprouts, you know you've 
    decreased the length of the game by one move if certain conditions
    hold. For this game, you've decreased the length of the game by 1 
    move every time you divide the board in two pieces, such that there
    are an odd number of untouched dots in each piece. (I guess you actually
    decrease it by 2 moves if M or N are even....)

  Anyway, has anyone ever heard of a game like this? Thoughts?
