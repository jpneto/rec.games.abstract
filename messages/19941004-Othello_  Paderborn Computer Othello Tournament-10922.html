The 2nd Paderborn Computer Othello Tournament was held over the weekend in
Paderborn, Germany.  All of the games were played over the Internet Othello
Server, which made it possible to have programmers and any other interested
people watch the games as they happened.   

The common consensus of most human Othello players is that the top computer
programs are playing at a higher level than the top humans.  This was fairly
evident during the tournament; the poor programmers (myself included) were 
often struggling to understand why their programs were playing the way that 
they were!

After the first round-robin, four programs clearly emerged ahead of the 
others.  Eclipse (Mike Giles and Colin Springer), Logistello (Michael Buro),
Kitty (Igor Durdanovic), and Bugs (Jean-Christophe Weill) were leading the
other six programs.  To determine the champion, the top four programs played
a smaller round-robin between themselves.  The programs reversed colours for
their second meeting; computer programs of equivalent strength tend to favour
the White pieces over the Black pieces. 

Logistello came back and won three games in the last round-robin to tie
Eclipse.  The two programs had only lost to each other during the tournament,
and the title was given to Logistello on disc differential.  Kitty finished
in third place.

The final ordering, as given by Michael Buro (the tournament director) is
given below.  Selected games from the tournament will be posted in a 
separate article.
