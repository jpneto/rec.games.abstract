The Scoop: I'm fishing around for a Masters Thesis Topic in Computer Science.
I'm interested in working up a program for a game, but not of the typical
search variety.  One vague idea that I've been toying with is to work on a
game where each piece could have a mind of its own and limited information
about the overall game.  Centralized-but-slow strategies could be contrasted
with strategies where less information is shared between pieces, so small
groups can act fairly independently and quickly.

You know, my first thought was "Aha, Icehouse." But I see you've noticed
that. Have you considered RoboCup? (Robotic Soccer?) There is a 'simulated'
category. Each piece has limited information (a 'field of vision'), pieces
can 'shout' messages to other pieces (but too much shouting causes messages
to be lost).

RoboCup does use a physics engine, so it may be too real world.

Back to board games, perhaps taking something like the old 3M/AH
Feudal, a chess like game where each piece can move each turn, and
forcing <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>EACH Piece<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to decide where to move on each turn. Of course,
each piece should not have full information on the battle, otherwise
they could presumably use the same altorithm to 'coordinate' making it
no different from an overall decision maker.

One of the Dvonn-family of games uses hourglass timers as pieces, but
I think it is still turn based.

For simultaneous movement, Blue Max is very good. I'm sure that the
dogfighting genre has other games (Ace of Aces, etc).

And many games probably could be converted to simul-move or time based
decision making. Don't know if they'd be interesting games anymore,
but that doesn't mean they wouldn't be interesting projects...

So what I'm asking you, dear reader, is for interesting games (from an AI
standpoint) with simultaneous movement or time-sensitive games in which
several pieces have the option of moving on any given turn.  Also of interest
are other nondiscreet positional games, where there aren't "spaces" per se.

Thank you for your insights interesting pointers.
