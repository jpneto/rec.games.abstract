How about an update, Daniel?  The last we heard from you, May 1 was the
aniticipated contest finish date.  Now we're at May 9 and we've heard shit
squat from you.

If you're abandoning the contest, Daniel, after hijacking it, the least you
could do is have the fucking balls to let us know, so we can set about
finding a reliable contest coordinator.

I hope you prove me wrong and announce the results but I'm starting to
suspect you're flaking out, big time.  You invested as much time as anyone.
Actually more.  So I don't get it.  But can you at least have the fucking
decency to let us know what the fuck you're doing after keeping everyone on
ice all this time??
