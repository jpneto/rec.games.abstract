An interesting article (not sure just how scholarly it really is) is
available at the link below:

It purports to examine the variants, goes into a bit of detail on
Linnaeus' description, and also talks about the Roman games that might
ultimately be the ancestors to tafl.

I'll check this later - thanks for the link.
This is the second reference to table games being descended from Rome. If
anyone has other references for this I'd be interested in knowing about
them.

Here's what I gather from my reading so far (excerpted from an article I
wrote on Fidchell and the Ballenderry game board generally thought to have
been a "Tafl" game):

There are some opinions which argue that Irish game Fidchell was not a
Tafl-style game. One argument suggests that it was not any game that is
currently known. The other theory is that it was a British variant of
Latrunculorum. Although it is recorded as early as the first century B.C.,
Latrunculorum itself is a subject of debate among classical scholars. A
number of Roman-era game boards in both square and rectangular shapes and
in varying sizes are believed to be examples of it...

�Gwyddbwyll� and �Tawlbyrdd� are both referred to in Welsh sagas.
Fortunately, a manuscript from 1587 in the Welsh National Library solves
the mystery in regard to Tawlbwrdd. The description is unmistakably a
Tafl-style game set on an 11x11 grid: �The king in the center of the board
and twelve men in the place next to him, and twenty-four lie in wait to
capture him� -with the 24 attackers equally spaced on the four edges of the
board. The term Gwyddbwyll seems to be older than Tawlbwrdd. Part of the
theory in regard to Latrunculorum is that Gwyddbwyll was its Welsh
counterpart, and that Tawlbwrdd may have been imported by Norse and/or
Saxon invaders and therefore gradually replaced Gwyddbwyll.

P.S. we sell our own Fidchell game directly based on the Ballinderry game
board if you'll excuse a commercial note... <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.historicgames.com/wood.html">http://www.historicgames.com/wood.html</a>
