: Well, it seems that what you need is a method of easily representing two
: different values on each piece, one ranging from 1 to 11, and the other
: being in the set {1,2,3,5,8}.

: First, each piece must be identified as having a side. Checkers pieces are
: a good size, and come already color-coded for two sides, so I'll use one
: of those as a starter.

Yes, but checkers have another feature: they stack...

: Next, each piece has a rank. Write a rank on the top of the checkers
: piece. When a piece changes rank, change the piece to one with an
: appropriate number on the top. I forget how many pieces existed in the
: game, but this means that you will need 5 * (number of pieces) different
: pieces to cover all possible situations.

How about this: instead of writing the number on the top, why not just
stack up n checkers to represent the strength.  That would give a much
more visual representation, and be easy to manipulate.

: Finally, you need to indicate decay. Drill a hole in each piece, big enough
: to fit a toothpick. Make a number of little flags out of toothpicks. Write
: a letter from A to K on each flag. For starters, each piece has an A flag
: put in it.

: Make a row of boxes along one side of the board, lettered from A to K.
: Put a marker in the A box to start with. At the end of every round, move
: the marker one letter forwards. When it passes K, it wraps around to A.
: If, after moving the marker, a piece has the same letter on it's flag as
: the letter the marker now indicates, it has expired.

: Whenever you move a piece, update it's flag to the letter the marker is
: currently indicating.

Alternatively, how about little stickies like post-its that have the numbers
1-99.  Each time you move a piece, you stick the move number on top.  The
current move is the lowest sticky you still have.  The only thing I don't
like is that it is hard to tell when a piece is going critical.  Maybe you
could use the color wheel for this.  Make the stickies from 1-11 go from
red to violet and back to red for #12.  Then you could tell by color which
ones were decaying.  (You'd still need the numbers of course but the color
would be a reminder of which pieces are going bad.)

My 2 cents.
