Someone has put a fair bit of effort into that web site, but carefully

I think it tells us more about the marketing strategy than the quality of
the game. The rules can probably be written on a single page. The board
could probably be photocopied. The game may (and may not be) great, but how
do you make money from that? The way the game developer has chosen to try is
to bundle the intellectual creation with an expensive home-decorating
object. Explaining the game in a public forum would thwart that strategy.

I also found the mumbo-jumbo off putting, however. If the game is good,
players will develop their own symbolic relationships with the aspects of
its play. I found some of the designer's comments akin to telling a new
chess player that he should envision knights as loose cavalry formations
that can penetrate enemy lines, bishops as powerful clerics whose mutual
excommunications can have devastating effects on the half of the world that
follows their sect, but no effect on the other half of the world, etc. Those
are plausible personifications, but they can't compete with what players
come up with for themselves.
