Go equipment is a marvel of ancient engineering for a lot of reasons.

1. Eye shaped cross section of the Go stone.

a. It's the minimal volume shape which is self stablizing and which holds an
easily graspable, elevated edge horizontal. It's always right side up of
course. The minimal volume matters because 181 stones have to fit
comfortably in a bowl, not a bucket. Besides the stone's shape being of
minimal volume, it has to fit together well with like shapes. Go stones fit
together more snugly, i.e. with less airspace per stone, than do marbles for
example.

b. Go stones absorb energy from board and stone collisions by rolling, and
then release the energy as friction from continued back and forth rocking on
the board while possibly brushing against neighboring stones.

2. The board is undersized in the latitudinal direction, why? Is it to make
the board appear more square from a seated position?

No. For one thing, the stones, the focus of the game, appear less round from
a seated position. A square looking board is little consolation.

Visual overlap. Like-colored stones in a group appear more group-like when
they visually overlap. Like-colored stones in longitudinal sequences tend to
visually overlap because of the seated angle of view. But the seated angle
of view has no affect on the appearance of a latitudinal stone sequence. By
making the board too small in the latitudinal direction, the stones are
forced to zigzag slightly, resulting in visual overlap from a seated
position.

3. Black stones are slightly larger, why?

A gap between adjacent white stones isn't nearly as unsightly and
distracting as the same size gap between black stones because of the light
board color. White gives up a little of his stone diameter to Black to
compensate.

4. Stones of both colors have more room than they need in the longitudinal
direction, why?

Ergonomics. More room can be allowed for the easy placement of stones since
the stone height is sufficient to provide visual overlap, even with a little
longitudinal space between the stones.

Moreover, any zigzagging in the longitudinal direction would appear
exaggerated from a seated position. Zigzagging in the latitudinal direction
creates the opposite effect. Latitudinal zigzagging appears scaled down when
viewed from a seated position.

When you look at the ancient design of Go equipment from the perspective of
visual balance, and from the perspective of a seated player, the relative
stone and board dimensions fall into place.

4. The Goban - huge block of wood. Tables and chairs of the time weren't
tree stumps. Why the goban? Inertia. If you stub your toe on a goban, you
get a stubbed toe. This would speak to the severity of ancient Go play. The
crime of disrupting a game in progress must have been a serious one.

5. No "frame". The stones are flush with the board edge, why? Economy
perhaps, in the usual sense. You'd want to make the most of the giant wood
block you created. But I think economy of form would have been more
important. Go is a study in minimalism. 5 faces of the block are blank and
the sixth face is lines and stones - not lines, stones, and a frame.

6. Philosophical considerations were undoubtedly paramount in the ancient
design of Go stones. The clam comes from the ocean. It's white and alive.
Slate comes from underground, etc.

How would you improve on the Go stone? It's like the wedge. Go equipment has
been optimized in every way possible, not the least of which being aesthetic
and ergonomic.

ADDITIONAL NOTE

I saw the black/white stone diameter disparity explained as compensation for
the optical illusion of black objects appearing smaller (witlesspedia). The
problem with this theory is that there's only a difference of about .3mm out
of 22mm, making black stones 1.3% larger than white stones. This minute
difference is absolutely imperceptible, even between two different color
stones pressed together in your fingers, never mind out on the board.
However, .3mm goes a long way toward closing tiny, but conspicuous, gaps
between adjacent black stones in a group, against the light wood background.


ADDITIONAL NOTE 2

I first posted the above article on bgg a few months back, before the then
new abstract games forum was overrun with mindless me-tooers.
