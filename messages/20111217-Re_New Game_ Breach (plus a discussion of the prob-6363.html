The idea has a good deal of Ketchup and Slither written over it. I
feared you might have forced a reluctant idea into a fashionable
implementation. But on second reading that's not the case.

The 2x3 negative feedback principle is there, be it that one doesn't
get to move one extra, but remove one of the opponent instead. And
that's where it becomes 'slithery'. But hey, those aren't the worst of
ancestors, and this theme and its implementation are sufficiently
unique and natural. Seems like a very promising game.

Pente is brilliant indeed, and you're right about the 5 captures.
Hexade doesn't have this additional object for, from your perspective,
all the wrong reasons: it's even more tactical. Remember however that
many people like or even prefer tactical games. And most inventors
keep players in mind. ;-)

As an afterthought regarding the pylon problem: Medusa has a movement
option for groups that tend to become less efficiently placed in the
course of the game. The games are in no way related, but the objective
to let more stones 'live' is the same.

Yes, I feel kind of lame for the similarity, but the problem has
proven so difficult that I just want create a good game (I abandoned
the constraint of originality).

And yes, I agree that there's nothing inherently wrong with tactical
games. I'm pursuing a personal preference. I should have made that
clear.

I'll check out Medusa
