Note there are no interior intersections between the altitudes and
the circle, only at the tangent points where they triply intersect
with the sides as well.

I will leave it as a fun exercise for fans to compile a list,
hopefully exhaustive, of all the "N positions" (Next player wins),
and all the "P positions" (Previous player wins).

And note, too, that if one too quickly learns the correct optimal

(though it is not as straightforward as regular Nim), one can easily
extend it to larger projective geometries; (the next one has 13 lines
comprising 4 vertices each and meeting four at a vertex.)

It can, OC, be played on any 2D geometry at all; but the projective
nature of the game ensures that the winning condition is equivalent
to producing a line of zeros, which is a nice target to aim for!

I haven't had the time to look at this but here's another
interesting diagram the game could be played (but the winning
condition for the misere game is not equivalent to producing
a line of zeroes).

Pappus Matroid: nine vertices, nine lines of three with every
vertex being on three lines.


A-------B-------C
 \"    / \    "/
  \ " /   \ " /
   \ /"   "\ /
    D---E---F
   / \"   "/ \
  / " \   / " \
 /"    \ /    "\
G-------H-------I


AEI and CEG are supposed to be lines.


Another possibility is M(K5), the cycle matroid induced by
the complete graph on five vertices but I don't want to draw
this in ascii. (it has ten vertices, ten lines of three with
every vertex being on three lines.)

I added rec.puzzles and removed sci.math from the groups
because it seems more appropriate to me.
