Don't we have enough soccer games already?  What a lame, draw prone
concept to keep designing endless new games around.  Now we have
Robosoccer, being described on bgg as "One of the coolest games out
there."  No doubt.

The first one, Penguin Soccer, was lovely but was also more than
sufficient to represent the class.

Well I think the ultimate soccer game is Christian Freeling's,
Hanniball. I've played penguin soccer with my Treehouse set and there
aren't enough options to really keep it interesting (for me at least).
In general I think abstracts should not be designed around narratives,
whether they be sporting events or galactic wars. Abstract games
should ultimately be designed around mathematical and spatial
relationships.  "I'm going to simulate going out on a blind date with
a dragon." is a terrible starting point for designing an abstract, you
can write a book or make a movie about that shit, but the
architecture, as you call it Mark, has to be at the forefront of the
design of an abstract game. If it isn't, what you have is an arbitrary
collection of rules with no organic flow or elegance. If the folks on
BGG are telling me that reducing draw rates, limiting turn order
advantages, creating elegant rule sets and adding depth to a game are
not the necessary skills that an abstract designer needs to make a
good game, then I think just about anybody could design abstract
games. This brings me back to Hanniball. I think Hanniball's success
as a design is its clear direction. It was not conceived as a soccer
simulation but rather an attempt to improve on the shortcomings of the
fundamentally broken Jeson Mor, one of the worst games hosted on iggc.
The soccer theme was just a nice way to appeal to our whimsical
nature. So my summation statement is that while soccer themed games
can be great, abstract designers who cannot appreciate the abstract
nature of this discipline, deserve to fail.
