(Maybe the coin toss, or they could auction the game throw between
them in advance, with an agreed signal when it's invoked by mutual
agreement. That solves most of the problems you raise, even though a
simple coin toss is mostly good enough.)

It's important that the coin is tossed in the drawn position, not at
the start of play.  If it's done at the start of play, the winner of
the toss will actively play for the draw, which is much easier than
trying to win.

And finally, what's the problem with draws? Apart from that draws
can be instructive and interesting, let's just suppose they aren't,
and that 80% of games are draws (I think it's slightly less than
that). So only 20% of games are interesting. Who has time to
watch even that 20%? The only people who'd have to watch draws
are people watching a single game, live.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's a very good point.  The only situation where one is `forced' to
watch a draw is in a match, as distinct from a tournament.  However,
in a match, it doesn't matter whether draws are scored at a half-point
each, a third of a point each or even twenty points each.  Only an
asymmetric scoring system for draws would affect matches.
