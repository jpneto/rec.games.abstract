We are getting a bit off-topic, but Macysburg is a game unlike any other that I've ever seen. Yes it has roots in both chess and wargames, but all games have roots in other things. Nothing arises de novo. So I would question your assertion of "totally new" as possible. 

The 3 shatranj variants I offered above were closely followed by by a side-step to the direct ancestor of Command and Maneuver, namely Chieftain Chess: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSchieftainchess">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSchieftainchess</a> and I offer this game as something reasonably new. It certainly got me thinking along different lines, and led to concepts like chesimals, chess animals. <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/the-games:chesimals-1">http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/the-games:chesimals-1</a>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/chesimals-2">http://chessvariants.wikidot.com/chesimals-2</a> Would these qualify as a reasonably new idea? 

You see, I'm not sure what you mean by "totally new". In discussions with others and numerous internet searches, I've found others had somewhat similar ideas to the games I linked in this thread, but nothing that indicated somebody did any of these before. Truthfully, I'm surprised by this, because to me, once I started working on the games, they seemed to be perfectly simple and logical extensions of what I'd seen before. Thus I was surprised no one had done them before I did them.

What is totally new for example is :
My invention of capturing by "topological" symmetry! No one invented it before.
Or my idea to build an abstract game using real animals (mouse, cats, dogs) combined to kind of devices. 
Or using water in a game (gravity forces and so on)
I have hundreds of ideas never imagined before.
Anyway what you are considering as new is just some improvement.
What if you create game where building the arena play (board) is itself a part of the game?
What if each player can imagine under some constraints the pieces he will use their moves their way of capturing and so on?

Okay. Would you be kind enough to give me links to those games?

Sozee (here in rec abstracts) for the capturing by topological symmetry.
For the use of water you could find it in BGDF 
For the animals I had never publish it.
Keep in mind that I used more than 100 nicks in different forums to publish my games (I want to be anonymous. I`m not running for money or glory).
At least 200 games invented by me were published on Internet(BGDF,BGG,Trictrac,rec abstracts, my blogs, etc...).
And 100`s were never ever published.
All my games are stored in papers and some in one of my computers which is NOT connected to internet.
