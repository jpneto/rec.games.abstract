Apologies to all Morninton Crescent ludophiles for the previous
posting. The Topovian Faction was exculpated at last year's MC AGM in
Regensburg and in no way speak for the current High Table.

Although I begrudgingly admit that many of the points made in the
previous post are fair, one cannot allow the historical section to
stand, given the obvious errors made.

Mornington Crescent of course refers to a faction of the Knights
Templar and has clear roots in Malta. What began as a medieval
discourse and secret method for communication amongst the fraternity
has morphed over the years into something entirely different. That
difference is considered by many to break into several parts each of
which, while fully self sufficient, contribute moreso to the whole.
The saying "The sum is greater than the parts" is one clue as to the
importance of Mornington Crescent on the original Latin, now English,
language in which the game is played.
