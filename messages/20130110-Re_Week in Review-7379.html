Corey, you're totally coming unhinged.  I told you it was a joke.  Just for the record, I'm totally against the exploitation of children in any way.  In Toddlers and Tiaras the moms totally sexualize their kids.  It's disgusting.  Did you watch season 4?  It was outrageous.  I totally don't watch that anymore hardly.

Dude you're a ranting lunatic.  What are you - Hazen?  You're a weasel.  It blew up in your face, just like I said, and now you're coming unglued.  You got exactly what you deserved, weasel.  Btw, you never responded to my "underground dungeon" charge.  Hoping nobody noticed?  Or is this something I supposedly fabricated like your dog carcass thrill?

Lets just analyze the logic (or lack thereof) here. Under what
circumstances would I mention on iggc that the decaying corpse 
of an animal aroused me?

Maybe you were totally drunk, as usual.  All I remember is the revolting image of you standing over an animal corpse getting your jollies, "you sick fuck".

Mark, you've only been a thorn in my side providing variable degrees

Why, because I shit on you as a designer?  And because I serve as a painful reminder of your fizzled plans to show me up?  I didn't get where I am whiling away the hours on a Playstation 3.  Get off your lazy ass and do something with your life.  Stop blaming the 1% for your self inflicted woes and wallowing in self pity, you crybaby.

Good analogy, because you're the Rhesus monkey here, rattling your own cage..  I can't be the only one amused by your retarded histrionics, monkey boy  :D
