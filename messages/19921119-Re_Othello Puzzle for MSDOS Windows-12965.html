Well, WINDOWS ships with an Othello called "reversi".
It has four levels of difficulty.
It is possible to win ALL 64 pieces at the first three levels.
What are the moves ?

It's possible to do it on the last level as well.  As for the moves, I dunno,
I play when I see it.

Is it me, or is the Expert level quite a ways less competent than the Master

I don't know if they've improved it since then, but a few years ago I
played a C64 version (can't remember what it was called) against the
Windows player. The C64 was on level 3 (out of 8). Windows was on its
highest level. Can you guess who won?
I wasn't very impressed by that Windows player.
