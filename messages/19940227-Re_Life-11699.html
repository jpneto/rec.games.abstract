: It referenced a Scientific American article by Martin Gardiner
: way back in Oct. 1970.  This article speaks of the works of 
: John Horton Conway, Univ of Cambridge.  John started the game

: Anyway, those are my sources, here is my attempt to explain
: how it is played...

: ---
: Using a grid, with flat pieces of two colors, you lay down a
: pattern and then apply some 'genetic laws' to determine how
: pieces are born, killed, or survive.  You apply X number of
: generations and watch.  The rules are:

:  1. Every counter with two or three neighboring counters (out
:     of the 8 possible) survives to the next generation.

:  2. Every counter with &gt;= 4 counters dies. (overpopulation)
:     Every counter with &lt;= 1 counter dies. (isolation)

:  3. Every empty cell next to exactly 3 counters is a birth cell.
: ---

: After following these rules patterns may emerge.  In the book,
: it is played as a game with one team working against another.

: My problem is that I know nothing about programing.  And I am
: sure that this is already out there somewhere.  Anyone know
: where? [Well, I do know some basic...]

: Particularally, is there a program with variables for grid 
: size, and the possibility to program how many generations you
: can jump to, and even for changing the numbers related to
: live, die, be born?

: Thanks for your time,
: Jeffrey S. Davidson
FYI there are two good books on the subject (at least two), Martin 
Gardners Wheels, Life and other mathematical amusements and The recursive 
universe (cosmic complexity and the limits of scientific knowledge) by 
Willaim Poundstone.
Hope this helps
