Hello Canada,

After downloading your posting and reading the rules a little better,
I have some more questions.
But first, a remark for those who have a Macintosh and did not read my
earlier posting: read it, there is a source code offer in it.
And now my questions:

Q: Why the KO rule? I have the original board version of Abalone,
and there is no such rule in the board version of the game.
If it has been added to avoid endless repetitions, what's the problem?
It's up to the programmer to put some randomnesss in his program
if he wants to avoid draws this way. When neihter of the programs
does anything to avoid endless repetitions, it's a fair draw, isn't it?

Q: What about the maximum # of moves: does white lose at move 201,
or is it a draw? (I think a draw would be the most fairest rule)
