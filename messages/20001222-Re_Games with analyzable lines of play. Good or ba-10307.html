The RULES of bridge are well defined. When bidding which bids are legal
is well defined. When playing which cards are legal is well defined.
What is not covered by the rules are conventions -- both during bidding
and card play.  I tend to equate the conventions to be components of the
strategy and tactics of bridge.  The fact that bidding conventions exist
is acknowledged by the rule requiring the partner of the bidder to
explain the meaning of the bid if the opponents ask.

Ok, initially I thought you meant just the mechanics of the game were
well-defined without the issue of alerts, but then you used the word "rule"
in your last sentence. Please make that rule well-defined, particularly the
"meaning of the bid."

1) If your partner knows that you make psychic bids, your partner
should alert essentially everything or otherwise make this clear.
2) Your partnership's bidding conventions are supposed to be
symmetric.
Does your partner make psychic bids the same way you do, and do you
thus alert your opponents?

Unless you have a convention on psychic bids (the partner knows when a
particular bid is/will be psychic), a simple general warning that your
partnership uses psychics is enough.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

It is the usually accepted thing to do. I did play with psychic fiends,
though, and I had substantially more information about their tendencies
than the simple warning conveyed. In particular, that they did not make a
psychic bid in certain circumstances carried enough information to be
alertable, in my opinion. Our solution was to restrict the psychics
somewhat and turn them into a convention, which meant that I had to do
them, too.

For those who do not play enough bridge to know what a psychic bid is, my
definition is a bid that willfully and grossly violates the accepted
conventions of the partnership, that is, a lie to your partner and your
opponents. For example, if to open 1 spade promises 5 spades and a decent
hand, then it would be a psychic bid if I said it with 2 spades and a weak
hand.

Such a rule would be illegal, except as a convention and the opponents
would never be bound by it.

Context:
"Ahh, your talking about strange extra rules that tournament organizers
add to the game.  -- That is an entirely different problem, you have a
problem with house rules.  The not helpful advice is 'if you don't like
the rules, don't play'."

See the previous citation allowing sponsoring organizations to restrict
bidding conventions and the following discussion that I just randomly found
with google:

I constructed a neat (IMO) destructive system which was declared illegal
(locally). I'm sure it would be accepted in some places, though.

Bridge assumes a high level of ethics. However, a partnership used to
playing a bad but complicated set of conventions will have an unfair
advantage over those who are not familiar with the proper defenses
against those conventions. Thankfully, there is a lot more to bridge
than exploiting strange conventions, but I would like to see at least
some tournaments have no restrictions or alerts on the bidding
whatsoever beyond constraints on passing extra information.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The ethics here is that having an undisclosed (to the opponents)
convention is considered cheating.  There is no trival way to prove that
a partnership is in fact using an undisclosed convention.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The fact is that the amount of information a player has about his/her
partner's tendencies or any complicated unusual convention exceeds what can
be explained to the opponents in a reasonable amount of time. I don't think
how much information is supposed to be divulged is well-defined.

Of course, there are many other terms that are not well-defined that do not
bother me, such as "hesitation."
