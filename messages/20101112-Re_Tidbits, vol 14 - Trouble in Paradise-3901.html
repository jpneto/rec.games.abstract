You can call someone a right fucker with no repercussions whatsoever,

I can't tell very well if posters are at all interested in my
contributions. You mirrored my post at r.g.c. and there's little
reaction. If I had posted there myself, some, I fear, would have
thought "what a conceited little brat" - and at best would have
ignored it likewise.

And indeed, if Bill writes "Corners have always been a slight
annoyance in connection games ..." , then he indicates they are
'special'. If he follows up with "Havannah grasps the nettle firmly
and makes them a complete special case. Rather ugly, though." then he
obviously argues that it is 'ugly' to treat something special as such.

It's clear that I cannot be the only one to find that wanting of
logic. And Bill obviously doesn't read what he writes. What does he
really think is 'ugly' about Havannah, I wonder?
