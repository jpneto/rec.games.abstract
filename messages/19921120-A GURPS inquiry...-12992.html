I am posting on this board due to the fact that this seems to be the
closest board I can find to answer my questions.  GURPS, Generic
Universal RolePlaying System, by Steve Jackson Games is a form of
abstract roleplaying.  Anyway, here goes.

I am currently betweent adventures in my current campaign.  The
campaign 'universe' is called Space Fantasy.  It contains elements of
science fiction (hi-technology, starships, weird alien races,
futuristic weapons, psionics, etc.) and fantasy (magic, melee weapons,
fantasy races, etc.).  I have also thrown in a bit of cyberpunk to add
tension.  There is much more to it than this, but I don't want to bore
you to tears.

I am just asking to find out if any of you can give some new plot ideas 
for adventures.  I have acquired several used copies of AD &amp; D
adventures, but I prefer to write my own.  My gaming group is very
advanced, meaning they haved gamed for a number of years.  I am
running out of original ideas for adventures.

If you want more information, I can e-mail the basic, overview
document.  Any questions, comments, thoughts, and ideas will be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
