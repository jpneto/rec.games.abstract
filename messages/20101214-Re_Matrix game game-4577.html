I believe that the following game should be in the spirit of rec games
abstract.

The game is called "The Abstract Game Matrix Game"

1) There are two players, R and C.
2) Plays are made on a rectangular mxn grid (initially empty). 2 &lt;= m,n
&lt;= 5.
3) Each player starts with one (1.0) points.
4) At each of m*n turns, both players simultaneously 'bid' some fraction
of their remaining points and name the row and column of an empty square
in the grid.
5) The player with the highest bid, writes the value of the bid in their
square (prepended by a '+' in case of player R, or by '-' in case of
player C). If the bids are identical then both players write their bid
in their chosen squares (unless they also both choose the same square,
in which case 0 is writen into the square). For simplicity, bids could
be limited to 6 decimal places after the '0.', perhaps.
6) The winning player's points (i.e. the winner of the bidding round)
are reduced by their bid, the losing player's points are reduced by half
their bid (in case of a tie in bidding, both players lose the value of
their bid)/ Play continues from step 4 until the grid is filled.
7) If one player runs out of points, the other player continues to bid
and fill squares. If both players run out of points then the remaining
squares are filled with 0.
8) When the grid is filled then either
  a) a matrix game solver is used to solve the matrix game defined by
the grid, and the players are awarded the appropriate game value (i.e.
the optimal strategy score), or
  b) the players, without access to any matrix solving software, play k
rounds of the game (10 &lt; k &lt; 100 perhaps), to determine a winner.

It's terrible to get slightly out bid.
It would be more enjoyable to play if players bid integers and had
fewer than 100 to start. I don't like the rule of the losing bid
losing half thier bid.
