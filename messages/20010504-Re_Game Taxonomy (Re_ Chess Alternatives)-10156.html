Each axis or attribute of the classification should be a hierarchical
taxonomy.  In the case of animals, there is in principle a single
underlying genetic taxonomy.  Morphologically, however, there are
multiple taxonomies depending on what one tries to study.  In medicine,
there is an interesting multi-axis framework called SNOWMED.  I find
it useful to "factor" the search space into a product of taxonomies,
just like mathematics.

I don't believe abstract strategy games can be harder to classify
than the real world :-)  Panther has said they aren't.

They ought to be;  the set of things one can conceive of is obviously
much larger than the set of things which happen to actually exist.

Besides,  it's the fact that there is such a thing as speciation and
that species evolved from other species is essential for there being
such a thing as an objective taxonomy for animals.  Classifying
animals is,  I think,  trivial compared to classifying books.
Games are probably somewhere in the middle.

There are many different criteria by which to classify a set of things.
Can the human population be classified?  Sure, by gender (easy).  Or by
their knowledge of Chess (harder).  Or by intelligence (ha, try that!).
A reasonably useful classification of abstract games is by their known,
written rules.  This ought to be easier than classification according
to more complex criteria like strategy, tactics, depth, clarity, origin,
community, etc.  Classification is "hard" means it is difficult to
define and disentangle the important criteria by which to classify, to
suit a purpose.  Mathematically, difficult (or impossible) to find and
apply an "orthogonal basis" so that each "thing" has a unique set of
coordinates and "similar things" are geometrically close.  Again, for
abstract games one reasonably useful orthogonal basis is the set of
criteria I laid out earlier:

  OBJECT ENDING CAPTURE MOVEMENT PLACEMENT FORMAT

Where each "coordinate" is not a number but a node in a hierarchical
taxonomy for that attribute.  This classification only addresses the
surface complexity of abstract games; hence, I included also

  STRATEGY TACTICS

as the beginning of a deeper, more interesting analysis and
classification.  Similarly, while the animal kingdom can be classified
"simply" according to their genomes, this doesn't address most of the
really interesting problems of biology -- why is a cheetah faster
than an man? how is the human brain different? why is someone more
susceptible to cancer? which type of cancer?

If by classification you are specifically referring to origin/evolution,
then yes books are terribly difficult if not impossible to classify
except trivially (by author/edition as opposed to by ideas/influences).
But if you are only thinking in terms of organization in a library,
well of course that's been done since books first existed.  Without
specifying purpose and secondarily criteria -- "why" and "how" -- there
is no "how hard".
