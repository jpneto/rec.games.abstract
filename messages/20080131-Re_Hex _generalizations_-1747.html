I'm disappointed not to see any further explanation why you think the
three examples I gave are not generalizations of Hex.  I agree with
the final sentence, but I believe that each of my examples has far
more than "one little item in common with Hex".

You want to see a real nice example of a generalization?  Look no

Great.  I hear it's the gold standard of Hex generalizations, so I'll
see how my examples stand up to it.

Seems true for Atoll and true for my examples.

Seems true for Atoll and true for my examples (except that one of
examples parameterizes "black" and "white"-- do you find that crucial
to Hex and Hex generalizations?)

The only difference between the games in the set is the number of

What is the only difference between Colorful Hex and Hex?  Is there a
member of Colorful Hex that is equivalent to Hex?  Is Hex a special
case of the more general Colorful Hex?

How about the other two games?  The answers there are more
interesting.

Is any of this making sense?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No.  The points you listed to support your claim that Atoll is the
only generalization of Hex also appear to apply to the three examples
I defined.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Let's approach this from another angle.  [...]  Oh, and the really
magnificent thing about Whopper 100 is that it's actually a
generalization of Chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

So... this is sarcasm?  Because Whopper 100 (or Whopper 101, I
suppose) would just as validly be a generalization of Hex as a
generalization of Chess, and you state that the only valid
generalization of Hex is Atoll.

I'd like to focus on the questions I posed.  I thought you gave me a
sincere yet uncompelling argument, then followed it with an equally
uncompelling sarcastic one.  It makes me wonder if I misread your
sincerity.
