"Winning the race" like that isn't nearly as satisfying as winning by

Of course  :)  My point was not that I like to sadistically beat my opponent
as badly as I possibly can.  It's just that in Quadrature, normally a brutal
game of annihilation, when an opportunity presents itself to cut and run for
the goal, you do it, unhesitatingly.  And it kind of seems like a cop out in
a sense.  Hard to explain.  I've got a challenge open at GamesByEmail
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamesbyemail.com/">http://www.gamesbyemail.com/</a>) if you're willing to give Quadrature a try. 
You will almost certainly be brutally annihilated though, lol

I was fortunate enough, by the way, to make a first game so full of
complicated crap that I vowed for simplicity ever after.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Simplicity is important to me too.  Not so important that every game has to
be like Mad Bishops, but pretty important.  I generally just allow what's
needed.  I won't tack on shit like a doubling cube in Backgammon.  Bad
example though.  The doubling cube is important to cut off dreadful,
God-give-me-cancer endgame races.

Well, before Havannah landed at LG and the computer guys came in,
there was only a rumour of a draw that had once occurred.
When the programs started on base-4 boards, and eventually got better,
the first real draws would tickle in (both bot v bot and bot v human).
Now we've had them at base-5 too, and one base-6 if I recall
correctly. Still thousands of games base-7 and up, without a single
draw. That's interesting I think.

Yes, I agree.

[DISCLAIMER: Christian, if it ever seems like I'm picking on you or your
games or your principles here, I'm not.   I may have strong views which
directly contradict yours, but they aren't intended to diminish.  Consider
Amazons by Walter Zamkauskas.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>love<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> Amazons, but I would never have
markers being placed on squares.  Not intended as a put-down.  It's just
that I can appreciate things that aren't my thing.  I'd be bored to death if
everything was my thing.]

In my high school there was a weird kid with bug eyes studying to be a Chess
grandmaster.  One day I sat down across from him and played.  I used a total
blitzkrieg strategy, capturing at every possibility.  Would you believe I
won?  If you (a general you) did, you'd be a fucking idiot.  Of course he
won, but I think I had him off balance momentarily.

If you (Christian) had a bunch of grandmaster hopefuls studying your game,
that base-8 base-9 business would be going through the roof.  More than
that, even if it works in a practical sense, it's an aesthetic problem.

Some people <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>loathe<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> draws.  I've met them.  I'm not alone.  I can't release
a game in which my playership even <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have to endure a cyclic draw -
even once!

Sorry about the rambling nature of this, but - that being said - I'm not
repulsed by infinite games.  Conjecture: This is hard to express so I'll try
by way of example.  Let's say you take a finite subset of the infinite game
Chess - all games less than 200 moves that conclude in checkmate.  This game
would be richer, i.e. its game tree would have a larger "practical use" area
than a "comparable", naturally finite game (not requiring superko), whatever
that game might be.  Just rule of thumb kind of shit.  I'm sure there will
be examples that contradict this.

There's nothing at all I can do against the notion that my life is

As do I  :)  There's something very compelling about games.  I can't quite
put my finger on it, but why fight it?
