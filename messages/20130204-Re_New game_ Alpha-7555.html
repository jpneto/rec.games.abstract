I'm curious about the relative values of opening moves. There are two determining characteristics, the largest group and the number of groups. Both count fairly heavily. Say you've got a largest ten-group and also ten groups, then adding to the ten-group and starting a new (own) group result in the same increase. Starting a new group matters little in terms of where you place it. Positional considerations aside, the might be placed anywhere and count the same. So determining the relative value of opening moves isn't immediately clear to me - and the use of a pie depends on precisely that.

You've expressed the same concern about Redstone, but I don't quite understand it in either case, unless you mean that all first moves should be swapped because there are no bad ones available, which I guess it's a possibility in both games. If you mean, instead, that the first moves of the game have a negligible value, turn order advantage should be equally negligible, and therefore the pie rule wouldn't even be necessary. Using it wouldn't harm, either.

I think you meant "which I guess isn't a possibility" - but that;s a guess indeed. It may be that not all opening moves are equally good, but that they're all good enough to swap. In Havannah it's leaning that way, the philosophy being that a stone is a stone and that you can always make it 'work'. I have little problem accepting any first stone for a swap against a more or less equally strong opponent. But in Havannah it's also clear that the advantage must come from 'speed'. Havannah is essentially a race game: speed dictates who has the initiative and the first move is a tempo, however awkwardly positioned.

In Alpha I can't quite see the nature of the advantage one would derive from say making a first move in the center or near the edge. Small groups count for 1, whatever their number or wherever they are positioned.
