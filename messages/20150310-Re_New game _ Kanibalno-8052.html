And let me wrap up this post with a question about the actual purposes of this site. Is this actually a site where people are invited and encouraged to discuss abstracts, or is it strictly a site for the self-aggrandizement of a few, primarily by insulting others?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

lol, good question.

A little historical context:

When I first got here years ago, rga was being lorded over by Bill Taylor and other math professors to discuss Nim variants.  I don't remember Taylor ever designing anything while he was here.  Instead he would remind everyone of games he had designed in the past and how they were "the world's simplest game" and other such braggadocio nonsense.  As with the insults, there was never any shortage of self-aggrandizement here.  At my peak I was announcing a new game here like every other month.  Taylor and his cronies would either ignore them, or make some snotty little condescending comment - and then ignore them.

Yes, insults were flying, as they do at every unmoderated site.  An unmoderated site is no place for pussies (not to suggest that you are one).  Long story short, me and Taylor eventually had a showdown, and he left the group, taking his math cronies, who knew jack squat about abstract game design, with him.  After that there was a surge in new game announcements from me, Nick Bentley and a bunch of other guys.  There have been periods of relatively high activity as well as low.  Right now it's pretty much me and Hazen.  I'm just here to shoot the shit since I've burned out on game design.  The other designers have pretty much dropped out too as far as I know.  Case in point, Nick.  He hasn't produced anything new in a long while - just minor tweaks to his existing games.  I think Christian Freeling may still be somewhat active in design but he doesn't come here because he takes self-aggrandizement to never before seen extremes, and no serious designer can stomach that.  I only invited Christian here to help chase out Bill Taylor, and he actually did a commendable job of that (thanks, Christian).  

Hazen is a fairly prolific inventor, mainly specializing in new mechanisms that can be used in other games.  Yes, you will be insulted by Hazen.  You will "win" not with counter-aggression, but with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>succinct<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> persuasive argument.  I.e., (no offense) not treatises or references to treatises.  Nobody has time for that.  If you've had enough, I for one wouldn't blame you.  I would just thank you for stoppin' in.

I would discuss Chess variants with you but I've proven not to be a Chess variant kind of guy.  At least not variants with all the kings, queens, pawns, checkmates, and all the things normally associated with Chess.  If you had a simple game, I'd discuss that with you, but I think you said you're not into simple games.

Hope this helps.  Off to my two hour, Chinese massage.  Ahhh, much needed :D

Enjoy! The massage, I mean. They busted 6 of the Chinese massage parlors near me, but I'm guessing that's just a drop in the bucket, considering I live in the geographical center of the NYC metro area - based on the aiming point for Soviet missiles in the past and, I strongly suspect, current Russian missiles - if they can get out of their silos and make it across the ocean. 

I'm into games with simple rules, but I designed my way right out of chess variants with the CaM series, and since I do wish to make a little to cover costs of prototyping, I may have designed my way out of abstracts completely. Dunno, we'll see what comes to mind in the future, but I have a few ideas to pursue that aren't at all abstracts. 

I freely admit I tend to be circumloquacious. And I can spell the word without looking it up... which is part of the problem. Fwiw, hyperchess came about because I was having trouble with linear differential equations - found out I was visualizing my math, and couldn't visualize the 4th dimension. So to help with the problem, I drew a small bit of 4D graph paper, and studied that. Didn't do damn all for my math skills, but I realized it'd make a hell of a chess board... 35 or more years later, it led me to chessvariants..org, and I got sucked in. After a few years as a member, then some more as an editor, I learned a lot about the first step of design, and had written 2 treatises, the 4D one and another called the ShortRange Project, based on a series of designs that became an alternate history of chess. CaM, and with it my best design, the Battle of Macysburg, came out of that series. 

I'm into simple rules that give complex games, if you consider chess and abstract strategy wargames to be reasonably complex. So it depends on your definition of "simple". I think Border War, the first CaM design that crossed the border from chess variant into wargame, to be simple, and there is a VASSAL implementation for that. It uses 5 different piece types, none of which moves more than 3 squares/turn. Leaders activate pieces within 2 squares of themselves (including themselves) and move 1 or 2 squares. They may change direction between the first and 2nd step. Infantry steps 1 in any (of the 8) directions. Skirmishers move like knights, and jump anythin in their way. Cavalry moves up to 3 squares orthogonally. Cannons move up to 3 squares diagonally. SImple chess moves. Capture is by replacement - move onto an opposing piece with a legal move and stop there, and the opposing piece is removed from the game. Terrain is very abstract. Pieces (except skirmishers) stop next to terrain they wish to enter, and move into terrain squares at the rate of 1 square/turn. Cannon can't move into trees. Cavalry can't move into hills - a standard heavy cavalry horse could not move effectively up or down a slope of over 7 degrees. And that, in brief, is all the basic rules. An amazing number of things just fall out of those basic rules. Players MUST keep a lot of reserves. Terrain offers a strong defensive position. Etc, etc. Very simple and streamlined, but it simulates a wargame better than a lot of wargames do! 

It took me about 50 iterations and several years to get from the original shatranj to Macysburg. Along the way, it taught me something about design. Despite what hazy thinks. And I'm fully capable of anything from a calm discussion of design to a knock down, drag out fight. On this site, I'd prefer the discussion. I'll stick around for as long as I can get that decent discussion. But I am a lumper, and you and hazmat are splitters; this will likely prove a source of some disagreements. ;)
