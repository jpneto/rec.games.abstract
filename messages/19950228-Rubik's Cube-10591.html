Hi,

I have some books about the Cube. The only problem is that they are written
in Dutch. One of the books is a translation from a book by David Singmaster
but I don't have the original title, ISBN number, publisher etc ... If anyone
is interested in the ISBN numbers/publishers of the books, mail me!

(M = Twist the slice between R and L in a way that the centre square that
     was in the U layer ends up in the F layer.
 E = Twist the slice between U and D in a way that the centre square that
     was in the F layer ends up in the R layer.
 S = Twist the slice between F and B in a way that the centre square that
     was in the U layer ents up in the R layer.
 A formula between bracets and with a number behind it means : Apply the
 formula n times where n is the number behind the formula)

A nice pattern:
1. E- M E M-
2. (B- U2 B R- D2 R)2
3. (R E)4 U- (R E)4 U
4. (L E-)4 D (L E-)4 D-
5. L2 (R S-)4 F2 (R S-)4 F2 L2
And now you must have a pattern that the author (Anneke Treep) calls
'Knot of Wool'

This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.                            FEAR
I must master it as I must master my life.                          FACTORY
Without me my rifle is useless. Without my rifle I am useless.
