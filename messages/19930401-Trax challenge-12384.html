Jon Ferro: sorry, the game you described is called 'Connections'.


My thanks to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:M.Nicholson@pioneer.arc.nasa.gov">M.Nicholson@pioneer.arc.nasa.gov</a> for solving a problem we
had - how to pictorially describe a Trax layout in ansi characters! The 
problem with the standard method of describing games is that too many
people still get their left &amp; rights mixed up. If you'e interested in 
the official notation (I don't know if it was included in the overseas
sets (by the way, Trax was invented in New Zealand 1980)) here it is
for Mels contrived example game.



      White(x) Black(o)

+x+   1. A1S          In order to keep to the        +x+      +x+
o o                   3-digit format the rules       o o  or  x/o
+x+                   require as the first tile      +x+      +o+
                                                     
                       S=straights, C=curves         A1S      A1C


+x+       2. 1AS  If played on top or        &lt;- 1A to avoid confusion with
o o       2. A2S  If played under.                playing to left (A1n)
+x+
o o
+x+

+o+
o/x
+x+   3. 1AR       played in position 1A, track taken to the right
o o
+x+
o o
+x+


+o+o+
o/x\o
+x+x+
o o\x
+x+o+      4. B2D   played in position B2, bending track down
o o/x
+x+x+
o\x/o
+o+o+


+o+o+
o/x\o
+x+x+
o o\x
+x+o+  5. A4R       White's silly move
o o/x
+x+x+
o\x/o
+o+o+
o\x/o
+o+o+

       so:
      
      1. A1S    2. 1AS
      3. 1AR    4. B2D
      5. A4R    5. WIN  &lt;- beginners: where? Two places!


As o shows up lighter than x on the screen, I suggest white be o
and black be x.

Thanks Mel.

So how about it Mel? Darcy? Any one else out there?
I challange you to a game by email. I propose that replies be posted 
within 1/2 hour after reading the move.

Also are you interested in the next World Championships (1994)?

By the way (again!) our club consists of 20 members, approx 10 have
email/news access
