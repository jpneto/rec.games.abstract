Nobody but you has yet spoken in favor of Symple in all these years. Your fellow Dutchmen have programmed it out of Dutch loyalty. And you've convinced fellow European ninnyhammer, Luis, that Symple is "perfect" in some perversely misguided sense. But everyone else simply ignores Symple, in spite of you relentlessly prodding and browbeating them for failing to understand how "great" it is.

I play it a lot, you're the one that is rattling on about it. That has a reason and it couldn't be that you don't care, because obviously you lose sleep over it. Are you afraid people might like it?

Do you recognize creative genius when you see it, Christian?

Not necessarily, it depends on how knowledgeable I am in any particular field. Besides, only a few are considered geniuses by concensus, none of them an inventor of abstract games. Well, come to think of it, John Forbes Nash and Piet Hein may have been geniuses, but not for inventing Hex.

Do you have a thousand mirrors in your burrow Mark, or none at all (for fear of recognizing a hopeless case).

Now tell us more about Symple. You're the most Knowledgeable One who never played it :)
