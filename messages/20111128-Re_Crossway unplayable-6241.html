There isn't any sort of "huge imbalance" in Crossway.  Not with the
pie rule.  Just as in Hex, the center point is an excellent first
move, the corners are terrible first moves, and there's a range of
possibilities in between, including some very equitable ones.

You didn't answer my question about your knowledge of the pie rule,
Nihlis, and you still seem to have no knowledge of the pie rule.  If
you want to comport yourself as an authority on connection games, you
might want to learn about the pie rule.  Rare is the connection game
(Atoll, Fractal) that doesn't need it.
