RALF GERING a.k.a. Mr_Mancala

"I admire Mark Steere.  He is one of the most brilliant people who ever
lived on our planet.  He invented Impasse and Tanbo.  Tanbo is like a game
from another universe, absolutely fascinating.  Now he has created Byte:

Try it!

Ralf"

Ralf Gering, a.k.a. Mr_Mancala, posted these words in a public discussion
forum, the Yahoo group abstractgames in message #821 on November 11, 2005. 
Ralf later removed the message, but not before it had been backed up by
various Internet archiving services.  Later, in February 2009, Ralf Gering
had this to say about me and my games:

"His rising productivity is accompanied with the declining quality of his
designs.  (One could even postulate that his ever-accelerating pace is a
symptom of his more and more deteriorating health.) . . . A common critisicm
[sic]of his games is that they lack clarity. . .  Tanbo (1993), Steere's
second game and the one most widely known, has a powerful first move
advantage (67%), which turns it unplayable in serious competition.  Even
worse, it can be extremely lengthy . . .  His games are usually not very
much appreciated by players of abstract strategy games."

As you read the scathing condemnation of me and my games, you begin to
formulate a picture of the article's author, the emotionally unhinged Ralf
Gering.  The actual intent of the article, that I design terrible games,
goes unnoticed.  By the way, Tanbo is as fair as a game can possibly be. 
Move order advantage in Tanbo is statistically consistent with 0% as can be
verified with data publicly available from megasite ItsYourTurn.  Ralf
Gering's analytical ability is commensurate with his grammatical ability.

In 2005 Ralf Gering was apparently an anonymous fan of mine.  One day, out
of the blue, he mustered the courage to invite me to join a discussion group
for which he was an assistant moderator.  At the time I had no idea who Ralf
Gering was nor had I ever heard of said group.  But he was very enthusiastic
and seemed to have some connection to abstract games, so I accepted his
offer.  I would then behold the most dysfunctional discussion group I could
have imagined at that time.  Ralf Gering condescended to everyone in the
group.  But to question Ralf Gering's point of view on anything, no matter
how diplomatically, was to risk censorship and banishment - after which Ralf
Gering would forbid further discussion of the matter.

I don't like lording, even seeing it inflicted on others, and it didn't take
long before I'd had about enough.  Naturally I voiced my objection.  I asked
Ralf Gering to step down from his position as assistant moderator of the
group.  It wasn't even intended as an insult.  I just wanted him to be able
to freely join the debate without being compromised by his conflicting role
as assistant moderator.

Here I was, an up and coming abstract game designer that Ralf Gering had
made a big show of recruiting to his group two days earlier.  And now I was
doing the unthinkable - publicly calling Ralf Gering's ethical conflict into
question.  He couldn't very well censor and ban me at this point, but he
couldn't let the insult to his authority stand either, so he blew a gasket.
He angrily announced his resignation from the group and then vandalized the
group, scrambling members' settings and deleting as many files as he could
before the owner of the group caught on and kicked him out.  This was the
first of many game related groups that Ralf Gering would ultimately be
ejected from.

I was still somewhat new to the discussion of abstract games on the
Internet.  Shortly after Ralf Gering sabotaged the aforementioned group I
visited the Yahoo group abstractgames.  I'd been a member of abstractgames
since March 2005 but I'd never made a single post.  Now, eight months later,
I was confronted with a hysterical message calling for my ouster entitled
"Byte / Joao, I ASK YOU TO HELP!"  Ralf Gering was publicly imploring the
owner of a group I'd never even posted in to toss me out.  Incredibly, Ralf
Gering announced to the group that it was his birthday, suggesting that my
expulsion would make a fitting birthday present.  Yahoo group abstractgames
message #849, posted November 29, 2005 by Ralf Gering:

"If you don't remove Mark Steere from Yahoo! Groups I will report his
behavior to the police and also that Yahoo! is tolerating criminal acts.

Sincerely, RJG

-----------------

Joao, I ask you you to help [sic].  Any way It's my birthday today [sic].

Ralf"

Please understand that Ralf Gering was serious about this and that he was
about 45 years old at the time.  This message was actually fairly typical of
Ralf Gering with the shrieking, threatening, sniveling, and accusation of
"criminal acts".  It also typifies Ralf Gering's ongoing struggle with
reality.  Picture the police officer who fields the complaint about Yahoo's
toleration of criminal acts.

Ralf Gering is obviously not fluent in English.  His writing is peppered
with bad grammar.  You don't have to look far to find such gems as "his
ever-accelerating pace is a symptom of his more and more deteriorating
health," and "His rising productivity is accompanied with the declining
quality of his designs."  Like I said, it's peppered.  I don't fault Ralf
Gering for his bad grammar, but please don't lecture me on the correct use
of the English language.

Ralf Gering publicly demanded on various sites that Checkers must not be
considered a stacking game, unbelievably.  Equally absurd was his fanatical
insistence that Mancala games should be considered stacking games.  This is
not a misprint.  Ralf Gering had formulated a cockamamie, self-referential
system that explained away all the bad English (with more bad English).  The
"true" definition of stacking was actually the topic of a public debate,
instigated by a nitwit with a less than stellar command of the English
language.  Just for the record, Checkers was the original stacking game. 
Checkers (the pieces) have interlocking ridges for the sole purpose of
making them precisely stackable.  A stack of two checkers forms a single,
independent unit with a unique function in the game.  No game could possibly
be more qualified as a stacking game than Checkers.

Moving on to Mancala games, bizarrely posited to be stacking games by the
nitwit.  Where do I even begin?  This was the effect Ralf Gering had on the
forums he attended.  Obviously there are no stacks in Mancala games. 
Mancala stones are held in random piles within pits.  A stack has structure.
 A stack has order.  A stack has unobscured number.  A big pile of formless,
colorless Mancala stones has none of that.

Ralf Gering's stacking/piling nonsense was only a footnote in his ongoing
campaign to establish new, wildly absurd definitions of common English words
and phrases - new definitions that directly contradicted the existing
definitions.  Challenges to Ralf Gering's redefinitions were met with
vitriolic temper tantrums.  His frequent demands that native English
speakers recognize his "alternative" definitions started to piss everyone
off at Super Duper Games (see below) - even people who hadn't been paying
much attention to Ralf Gering up until then.  I believe that's what finally
got him kicked out of SDG.  The Ralf Gering lecture series on the correct
use of the English language had to be stopped.

Back in 2005 a couple of my games were implemented on Super Duper Games, at
the time a new game site.  These were my first games on the web.  I was
inspired to invent more games that were also added to SDG.  Ralf Gering
would later have two of his Mancala games added to SDG.  Typical Mancala
gameplay is fast and carefree.  It's a primitive game played in a primitive
manner, but it's fun.  It's entertaining.  You quickly take turns, scooping
and distributing stones, with little concern for the kind of accuracy you'd
expect in a more civilized game such as Go.

In one of Ralf Gering's games, what should have been the simple, fun part of
the game was instead an excruciating ritual of multiple stone placements to
be carried out slowly and in synchrony with your opponent's corresponding
move ritual, while simultaneously counting out loud.  It was inconceivable
that anyone other than Ralf Gering would find this type of gameplay
entertaining.  Ralf Gering stood by helplessly and watched his games drift
out onto the sea of oblivion, caught in a riptide of disinterest.  Soon he
began feverishly modifying his creations, demanding that the programmer keep
apace (publicly of course).

Eventually Ralf Gering came to suspect a conspiracy of some sort and lashed
out at SDG's owner and many of the active members with accusations of
unspecified "criminal activities".  Ralf Gering whipped himself into such a
lather it defies description.  I'd never seen anything like it from anybody
of any age.  Second place goes to a four year old I once saw throwing a
sustained, ear splitting temper tantrum in a library while his mother,
seemingly oblivious, used the copier.  Eventually Ralf Gering ground SDG to
a halt with his frothing hysteria, much but not all of which was directed at
me, calling for my ouster.  But this time it was different.  SDG was a site
that I had enjoyed socially for some time before Ralf Gering arrived.  At
one point early on, long before Ralf Gering followed me there, about 75% of
SDG's games were MSG games.  The notion of Ralf Gering ousting me from SDG
with a virulent tirade of hysterical spam, only a few days after his
arrival, was phenomenally ludicrous.

In the end, the only feasible option was that Ralf Gering had to go.  He
became the only member, before or since, to be ejected from SDG, very
publicly I might add.  For a designer to be kicked out of a game site where
his games are implemented is beyond unprecedented or unheard of.  It's
unimaginable.  When it gets to that point, you know that every avenue of
diplomacy has been explored and re-explored.

Later, after using other game related sites to conduct a smear campaign
against SDG's proprietor, Ralf Gering was caught sneaking back into SDG
under the guise of various aliases and awarding his own games the highest
ratings.  He had succeeded in raising his games' popularity rankings from
the bottom 3% to the bottom 5% before getting caught.  There's only one
reason to involve oneself with game design.  The love of design.  Not the
allure of popularity or professional recognition.  In every art, including
abstract game design, a sense of ethics is paramount.

I'm not the only person to have tangled with Ralf Gering.  Far from it. 
Ralf Gering's only real talent that I know of is being a cyberbully with a
penchant for making racial remarks.  Here is a sampling taken from the Yahoo
group abstractgames with the message numbers given in parentheses.

Ralf Gering to interrupt27 (#194): "Would you please stop to torture us
[sic] with this pseudo-intellectual nonsense! . . .  Again, please start to
use your brain (if you have one). . . .  Your rhetorics are disgusting and a
shame to you."

Ralf Gering about Wayne Schmidttberger, senior editor of Games magazine and
author of countless game books (#218): "I just said that this nonsense was
first suggested by Schmittberger. . . .  It's nonsense, because it wasn't
well thought out. . . .  American authors like Schmittberger and other
smatterers only produce a painful impression."

Ralf Gering to markthomps, renowned author (#220): "My comments to all
religious fantacis [sic] and white American racists: Would you please behave
like a 'normal' person and not like the member of a brainwashed Christian
cult or a Communist who is twisting words for reasons of propaganda?"

Ralf Gering about Wayne Schmidttberger (#221): "It would be good to correct
Schmittberger's exaggerated reputation he has as a game expert."

Ralf Gering to markthomps (#496): "You are a very stupid person.  The French
players are just the strongest players around."

Ralf Gering humor (#497): "a joke . . . 'So, you are Americans?!!'  'I hope
you don't mind, this is a French game.'  Most Europeans don't like
aggressors."

Ralf Gering on America, Nazis, and Jesus Christ (#502): "America has turned
into a rogue state, the most dangerous threat for world peace. . . .  The
majority of the American population is as deceived today as the Germans were
when they frantically shouted (in 1944?): 'We want the total war! [sic]' . .
..  Didn't Jesus say: 'You will harvest what you sow!'"

Ralf Gering to dtroyka, designer of the wildly popular Breakthrough (#505):
"Another blind American.  Too, sad!!!"

Ralf Gering to docreason, founder of IAGO [see below] (#1346): "It's very
easy to proof [sic] that you supported criminal behavior.  Come to Germany
and I will sue you."

Do you see a pattern here, besides a burning hatred for America?  The more
accomplished, the more successful, the more revered the individual - the
more vulnerable to vicious attacks by Ralf Gering.  Why is that, Ralf
Gering, a.k.a. Mr_Mancala?  I suppose I should be flattered by all the
vitriol you've spewed at me over the years.

In 2007 a newly formed discussion site called IAGO (International Abstract
Games Organization) preemptively banned Ralf Gering before he could even
join.  By this time Ralf Gering was well preceded by his reputation for
flooding discussion groups with hysterical spam.  IAGO was the only
remaining relevant group that Ralf Gering could be banned from, at least
that I know of.  Apparently the proprietor of IAGO saw the writing on the
wall and cut to the chase.

All in all, Ralf Gering has demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for getting
himself tossed out of game related sites.  Naturally he places the blame for
his troubled existence squarely on my shoulders.  But if I'm such an
instigator, how come I never got banned?  Like most decent, law abiding
citizens, I've never been banned from anything in my life, online or
offline, let alone a game site, of all things.

An obvious conclusion would be that Ralf Gering is narcissistic, paranoid
and psychotic.  But it's not even that complicated.  Ralf Gering was simply
born without a funny bone.  In a discussion at Board Game Geek, a popular
game database, Ralf Gering marked 17 of the messages as offensive, requiring
management to investigate each of the marked messages.  The response from
Octavian, the administrator in charge of forum moderation: "The vast
majority of posts you have flagged as being violations are in no way in
violation of our posting guidelines. Please stop abusing the system."  Ralf
Gering then started a new discussion on BGG complaining about Octavian's
lack of seriousness, and requesting thoughts from the membership.  Almost
all of the 100 responses denigrated Ralf as a self important oaf.

Here are some example comments from BGG members to Ralf Gering:

"You were completely off-base..." - BeyondMonopoly

"I entirely disagree with you." - boltongeordie

"How do you say "takes things too seriously" in german?" - hancock.tom

"This sight is not a militant information reporting site." - David Davies

"I think you need to unclench and get a sense of humor." - violentzen

"You must be alot of fun at partys. " - billyboy

"Lighten up if you are going to hang around here." - desertfox2004

"Go away and don't come back." - cbs42

"Some few people really deserve to be shown the door." - isaacc

The whole thread can be viewed here.  Ralf Gering has accused me at various
times of "defaming" him.  Is it really possible to defame someone who's
famous for being an asshole?

It's actually sad, looking back.  I almost feel responsible somehow.  But I
didn't kick Ralf Gering out of any of these groups.  I didn't have the
authority or influence to do so.  I wanted him kicked out of SDG as did many
others.  SDG was a harmonious site before Ralf Gering showed up and turned
it on its end.  Ultimately Ralf Gering's membership status was up to the
proprietors of these groups who really had no other choice but to expel him.
 It was either that or tolerate his unrelenting, crazed rampages flooding
their forums 24 hours a day.
