I can't help noticing r.g.c has withdrawn from the public scene. Isn't
that also a vacuum of sorts?
Mark touched on one similarity: neither of us is much of a player (now
there's an easy one for a quick remark ;-).

Concerning the balancing rule in Symple, Mark misses the point. Not
many mechanisms harbor their own 'pie rule', not as an explicit meta-
rule but as an internal balancing mechanism within the main mechanism.

Another phenomenon of theoretical interest (apart from its practical
applicability in games that employ the symple mechanism) that I would
have expected to be noted by the games community.
