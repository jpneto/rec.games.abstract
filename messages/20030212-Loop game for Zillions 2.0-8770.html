The Zillions website has my latest package, "Loop game," a 3-dimensional
connection game which Zillions plays pretty well, especially the smaller
board variant. I used the "create" command, which was a lot more convenient
than "cascade," "change-type," and "to," but which puts it out of reach of
Zillions 1.3.1 users. If you have 2.0, I would appreciate any feedback you
may care to send me, about the game.

I could send a Word document game description to anyone who asks, as soon as
I finish knocking it into shape.

David
