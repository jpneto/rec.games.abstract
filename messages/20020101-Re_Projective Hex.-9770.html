A little while ago I wrote on this topic.  It was an abstract board game
based on a board in the form of a projective plane, which consisted of cells
locally in hexagon tiling pattern, but with (necessarily) a few exceptions.

The boards I suggested were (with variable side length) of the following type:

|&gt; For the new Projective Hex, now probably the best abstract board game
|&gt; in the world (ha-ha!), the boards are similar to this as follows...
|&gt; 
|&gt;     A B C        As you see I've had to insert a 27th alphabet letter!
|&gt;    D E F G       Interior cells and interior-edge cells each have 6
|&gt;   H I J K L      neighbours, as in Hex; but the 6 corner cells have 5.
|&gt;  M N O # P Q
|&gt;   R S T U V      The side dimensions are always n and n+1.   Each edge
|&gt;    W X Y Z       is flipped end-to-end and laid alongside its opposite.
|&gt; 
|&gt; In this 3-&amp;-4-sided board, there are 15 edge cells which thus connect
|&gt; to their opposite cells via Projective connections as shown here...
|&gt; 
|&gt;     z_y_x_w
|&gt;    z/A B C\w     Each of the original edge/corner cells "re-appears"
|&gt;   v/D E F G\r    on the opposite side, in lower case letters.
|&gt;  q/H I J K L\m
|&gt; q&lt;M N O # P Q&gt;m  Note once again that each corner has only 5 neighbors.
|&gt;  l\R S T U V/h
|&gt;   g\W X Y Z/d
|&gt;    c~c~b~a~a
|&gt; 
|&gt; So on the original board, cell  H  is connected to D I N M Q V (in order).
|&gt; Whereas  M  is connected only to  N R L Q H.
|&gt; 
|&gt; The whole collection of 21 hexagons and 6 pentagons makes up a "standard"
|&gt; tiling of the Projective Plane.


So those boards have 6 cells with only 5 neighbours.


It later occurred to me that there is another, possibly simpler, way to
almost-hexagonally tile the projective plane, which would also do well.

The following type of tiling has 3 cells with just 4 neighbours each.

      a i h g         I haven't bothered to letter in the 19 central cells,
     b . . . f        though there are almost enough letters to do so!
    c . . . . e
   d . . . . . d      For this board, we do not need to imagine the pairs
    e . . . . c       of opposite sides dovetailed as before, because they
     f . . . b        are in fact <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>identified<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, as indicated by the letters.
      g h i a         So this board has a mere  19 + 9 = 28  cells.

As always for the projective plane, opposite sides connect in reversed
directions, as shown above.  All cells now have 6 neighbours, except for
cells  a d g  which have 4 each.  

e.g. cell a has neighbours b i and 2 internals;     and
e.g. cell i has neighbours a h and 4 internals, 2 "above" and two "below".

So in playing the game, when you fill an edge/corner cell you must remember
also to mark-as-filled the opposite one with the same letter (all as one move).


As before, the basic connection game to be played on such boards is like
the games "Hex" or "Y", the goal being to make a global loop of adjacent 
cells of your own colour.   For example here...

         x x . . 
        x o o . .       X has played 10 moves and O has played 9,
       . x x . x x      and X has just won with the loop-path from
      . o o x . . .     the top-left corner to the bottom-right, 
       x o x o o .      thus completing the loop.
        . o x o x 
         . . x x 

As always on the P-P the formation of a loop of one colour automatically
prevents any future loop of the other colour, so there is no "mere race"
element; it IS a race, but one whose completion cripples the opponent
as well!  Thus as explained earlier, the game is both equi-tasked and
mono-completable; both IMHO extremely desriable elements in an abstract game.

Of course the first player has a huge (indeed automatically winning)
advantage, and this can be dealt with in various ways, which is not
the main theme of this post, however.


It might even be possible to devise a commercial presentation that could
be played by ordinary folk with no idea of what a P-P was.  One would
have a plastic sphere, with holes appropriately arranged as above,
and a move consisting of sticking one of your coloured skewers through 
so that it poked out two opposite holes.  Then to win you must make
a loop that includes at least two opposite points in it!  The difficulty,
of course, is to find skewers that do this without all mangling up in
the centre of the ball!   Though I can't think of an answer to this,
I nevertheless claim, copyright and patent all commercial rights to
this game; though naturally anyone else is at liberty to play or make it
at any time providing they don't make any money for anyone in doing so!

Cheers,
