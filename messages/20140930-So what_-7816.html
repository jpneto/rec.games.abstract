I have no incentives posting games if no one is commenting.
No one will post any game if the situation remains unchanged.
Criticize negatively or positively it does not matter.
I know that the group is boycotted by the maffia-like ruling the BGG forum Abstracts Games.
Instead of thalking about creation they are spending their time on what is randomness what is an abstract game and so on.
Each one is trying to point out to his own games no matter what tthe debate is about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????????
Look at the guy who send a Cannonade. If we except Christian who is talking little bit about the game NO ONE is interested on what is the core of the game how to improve to make it better and so and so. And even Christian he tries each time to profit from posting to promote his activities!!!!!!!!!??????
Remember Hartunga!
Soon or later this guy will come with some interesting game.
I will not tell you why.
But remember what I said today about Hartunga.

I`m eager to start my drinking process even if I`m sick.
