Coil is a rare game of mine that I think is good.  It satisfies the
design constraints I hoped it would satisfy, and more importantly,
it's fun to play, for me anyway.

The goal was to design a game for a hex tiling, wherein the win
condition is a simple loop of stones.  However, the loop could not be
of the "wraparound" type on a projective board.  I love wraparound
loops as conceptual objects, but they have low clarity.  Take for
example Bill Taylor's Projex, one of the most conceptually pure games
ever invented, but incredibly hard to play for lack of clarity.

So, the most important constraint was that the loopy win condition be
a plain old loop that forms on a 2D board without wraparound.  The
other constraints were:

1. finite
2. drawless
3. mathematically fair (or as fair as a drawless game can be)
4. rules as simple as possible
5. as much clarity as possible

My solution: combine the contract mechanism from Jorge Gómez Arrausi's
Unlur (one of my favorite innovations of recent years) with the form
of win condition of my own Mind Ninja, applied specifically to a loop
pattern.

That said, here's the game:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coil is a game for two players, played with black and white stones, on
a hexhex board (hexhex7 is recommended). To understand the game, you
should know what a coil is:  A coil is any loop of stones that
surrounds at least one space. Note: A coil is a coil regardless of the
whats in the space(s) that it surrounds, whether it be stones of the
same color, the opposite color, or empty spaces.

Rules of the Game

1.      The board begins empty.   The game proceeds in 2 phases.

2.      Phase I
        a. The players take turns placing a black stone on any empty
space.
        b. On her turn, a player may pass instead of placing a stone.
        c. Phase I ends as soon as one player passes.
        d. The player who passed becomes Black, and the other player
becomes White.

3.      Phase II
        a. In this phase, Black must play black stones and White must
play white stones.
        b. Starting with White, the players take turns placing a stone
on any empty space.

4.      The game ends either when a coil of black stones has formed or
the board is full.

5.      If a coil of black stones has formed, Black wins.  White wins
otherwise.

6.      Note: White does not win if a coil of white stones forms.
White can only win by preventing a coil of black stones from forming.

In practice, it will become obvious to one player that she is going to
lose well before the game is complete, and in that case, she should
resign, so as not to delay matters.
