I had the same objection about themes being allowed.  In my mind, not
that I'm an authority on abstract games, but in my mind abstract games
are best defined by what they don't have: no random elements, no
hidden information (which would exclude simultaneous move games), and
(I always thought) no theme.

Back when I used to belong to a junior chess club, for a short while
(before it was discouraged as distracting from real chess) we played
some Kriegspiel - at which I was much better (relatively speaking)
than real chess. It's an interesting exercise trying to mate with e.g.
king and rook against king playing Kriegspiel (can't recall if it's
forced or not).

Kriegspiel has hidden information, but it's odd to classify it as not
an abstract game, when chess is.

(I believe how we played - which was from a well-defined source - very
slightly differed from the usual definition of the game in certain fine
details. But everything fundamental was the same. Note that we
aren't talking about the AH game of the same name.)

Backgammon and kriegspiel fit into what people consider "impure"
categories.  It is absurd kriegspiel wouldn't be part, so I ended up
adding the category "Fortuna" and hidden as a subcategory so that
Kriegspiel would have a home.
