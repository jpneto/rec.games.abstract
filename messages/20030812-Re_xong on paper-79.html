<br>I've read the rules since my last post, and Xong
<br>looks somewhat interesting.&nbsp; It probably is playable
<br>with paper and pencil (unlike my pentominoes

<br>Now the rules are getting fuzzy in my brain again,
<br>though.&nbsp; But I'm trying to keep this thread

<br>&nbsp;well, i have reams of sheets of Xong games on
<br>&nbsp;paper!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; i had 4 colored pencils for playing
<br>&nbsp;red &amp; blue for the legs, green to green out the
<br>&nbsp;killed hexes, and black for edging the pieces &amp;
<br>&nbsp;also drawing them on the margins with the turn
<br>&nbsp;number.&nbsp; i had the small xoids printed on the
<br>&nbsp;sidelines for easy reference, so you just had to
<br>&nbsp;write a turn number beside them at the beginning.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;problem is, the Random Xong version cant be done
<br>&nbsp;this way....
<br>
<br>&nbsp;well, thank you for taking a look!&nbsp; and i'll retitle
<br>&nbsp;this branch of the thread different, so we can keep
<br>&nbsp;pentominoes going in the main thread.
