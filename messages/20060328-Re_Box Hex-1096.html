|&gt;|I disagree.  Box Hex is essentially a three dimensional game.
|&gt;
|&gt;Suppose someone were to independently come up with the pattern of
|&gt;blue cells I show in the above link. That person might argue that
|&gt;such a board could be distorted into a box shape as you describe,
|&gt;but it does not change the essential two-dimensional nature of
|&gt;the game. How would such reasoning be different from yours?
|
|Mark's point here seems to be that, when the board is embedded in
|the surface of a cube, the game's distance metric for any given
|path closely matches the physical length of that path.

Okay, fair enough.

|&gt;|I'm not claiming that Box Hex is free of first (or second) move
|&gt;|advantage.  No game is.  My claim is that with Box Hex's four shortest
|&gt;|paths (two for each player), all of which travel around the center
|&gt;|(not through it), the simple symmetry of regular Hex is defeated,
|&gt;|and the overwhelming emphasis on regular Hex's center area is
|&gt;|greatly alleviated, as is Hex's powerful first move advantage.
|&gt;
|&gt;How does changing the importance of the central
|&gt;area have any effect at all on the first move advantage?
|
|It seems (I am no kind of expert) that, in regular Hex, the
|better shortest-paths are the ones in the middle (because it's
|harder to box you in against an edge); hence, there's a single
|area (the middle) of primary importance.  In Box Hex, you have
|two shortest-paths, equally good; the more a given move hinders
|one, the less it hinders the other; hence, there's no single
|area of primary importance.

If you look at hex games between strong players (and both Kurnik and
Little Golem archive ALL their tournament games,) you see the winning
path meanders like a river across a flat plain. If the central region
becomes less important, the river will merely flow around it. And I
still don't follow how this would have any effect on the advantage
of the first move. Let's not confuse the most popular way to use the
first move advantage with the advantage itself.
