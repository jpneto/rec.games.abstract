I would guess (and consider myself very well qualified to guess) that Maven
software would average over 400 points against the world's best player if
he used his normal style of play (in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary)

This is certainly true.  More generally, an average score doesn't mean much
of anything unless one specifies the competition.  Even then it's not an
ideal indicator because of varying styles of play, not to mention the
question of which dictionary one uses.

In answer to the original question, I would say that about 3-5 humans in
the world can (over a long period) break even or better against Maven
when the dictionary of reference is the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary.

a while back i was experimenting with Solitaire Scrabble.

all the tiles are face up, so you can draw whatever you want.
this is important - there is no element of chance involved.

the object is to make the Maximum Score.  only one player.

so you can arrange to have QUETZAL land on the triple word score with
the Z on the doubleletter score and so on....

has anyone else tried something like this?

- nate, who got as far as an incompleted 2342 i think (?), something
        like that, anyway....
