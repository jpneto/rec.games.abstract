This looks good.  I'm curious:  how often, if at all, is it advantageous to add a stone rather than spend a turn removing a dead group?  Can some dead groups simply be left until later to remove, due to the occasional urgency of adding a stone?

Its usually a good idea to hold a dead group as long as possible since any of the points adjacent to it will be off limits for your opponent's other groups and growing the already dead one is going to likely be a waste of time. By leaving the group on the board he is usually compelled to create some sort of mutual threat so it needs to be removed which uses up time he could spend developing his position elsewhere. However this is not axiomatic because often a dead group can impede the movement of your own groups and he might be developing a strong position behind his dead group or even ensuring captures following its removal. Odd tactical situations like this are even more common in Hex Rampart.
