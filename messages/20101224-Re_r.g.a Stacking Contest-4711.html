Well, I guess that about does it for existing stacking games.  Glad we got
that out of the way  ;D

not quite :)

Two of my favorite stacking games:
Chroma - which is based on the Four-Color Theoremhttp://www.cameronius.com/games/chroma/
Boche -http://www.cameronius.com/games/boche/

I guess Akron would also be a stacking game:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cameronius.com/games/akron/">http://www.cameronius.com/games/akron/</a>

Do you know if anyone has written a book on stacking games?  It's
looking pretty vast with fairly open parameters.  Connection Games did
a good job of analyzing that genre of games.  It would be great to see
someone undertake this behemoth.

We can accumulate them here and in Dieter's geeklist, if he would be
so kind. I read it rather sloppy obviously, not noticing that Bashni,
Emergo, Crossfire and Pilare were already in there :(

Anyway, there's a couple to follow, following the contest. My entry is
ready, came together nicely too. It's called "SOAR", but it'll be
after new year when I publish, because I want it to be accompanied by
Ed's applet, and he's away for the holidays.
