I do get the impression you waste more of your time in writing these
messages than you waste in deleting checkers articles or editing kill-files.

	How Peter spends his time is his own business.  He obviously wrote
	this message to persuade any of the resonable people who are cross-
	posting to rec.games.chess to stop.  You are obviously not a reasonable
	person and still insist on imposing your opinion that this thread is
	of interest to r.g.c readers.  This is just your opinion and yet you
	insist that you are right.  I think enough r.g.c readers have posted
	complaining that this thread is inappropriate and yet you still will
	not stop posting.  Just what gives you the right to decide that this
	thread is of interest ?  Because you read in a computer chess journal
	that they were related ?  If that is the case then those interested
	parties will subscribe to both r.g.chess and r.g.abstract.

	STOP POSTING ABOUT CHECKERS IN REC.GAMES.CHESS
