Monkey Queen's new official board size: 6x6

  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/index.html">http://www.marksteeregames.com/index.html</a>

I played 6x6 Monkey Queen three times by myself:
  1. checkmate on move 26
  2. checkmate on move 31
  3. burn-through in 74 moves

twice with Arty:
  1. checkmate on move 24
  2. burn-through in 52 moves

and once with Corey:
  1. checkmate on move 39

So, based on this extremely limited data, roughly two thirds of the games
end in checkmate on the 6x6 and the other third end in burn-through
(annihilation).

On the 8x8 board, the checkmate rate is around 20% and on a 4x4, which is
too small, the checkmate rate is 100%.

Gert, thanks again for mentioning the slowness problem.  I had kind of
noticed it myself but just dismissed it as a minor, sucky thing about the
game.  Your critique spurred me to action and the problem was easily fixed.
Monkey Queen gameplay is hugely improved on the smaller 6x6 board.  It's
more fighty and less racy.  No more cross-board trekking.

I don't have to deceive myself quite as much now in thinking of Monkey Queen
as an awesome game.

Note on playing style: My self test game that burned through (no checkmate)
was 74 moves, and my similar game with Arty was only 54.  Why?  Arty (who
won both times) played more aggressively than I normally would, forcing me
to play more aggressively in respone.  That makes the checkers churn faster.
 The game could be scaled up to 14 checker stacks I suppose, but let's leave
it at 12 for now since that fits the standard set.  Maybe experts will need
to scrounge up a couple extra checkers.  And experts there will be.  I've
got a real good feeling about Monkey Queen.
