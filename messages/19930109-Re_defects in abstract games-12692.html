While thinking about draws in Chess, I've decided that I probably don't
like the strict form of the 'no repeats' rule in general.  The problem
is that forcing repetition becomes an aggressive strategy.  It seems to
me that this would diverge from the spirit of most games.  For example,
I think that Abalone would have the same basic problem with prohibiting
repetition that Chess would.  By contrast, prohibiting repetition in Go
creates one of the central elements of the game, so this objection does
not apply in the case of Go.  On the other hand, repetition leading to a
draw is more intuitive (in games other than Go) because it implies that
neither player has anything better to do.
