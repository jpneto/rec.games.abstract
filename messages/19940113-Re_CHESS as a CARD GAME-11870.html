That's an interesting idea, but I just can't picture what the card
game would be like.  I have never heard of a card game which doesn't
involve any kind of luck.  I think it would be a necessary property
for our game.  Also, in virtually all card games, a player can see
some cards that his opponent cannot see.  Again, I think this cannot
be true of our game.

imagine following procedure at the beginning of the card game:

the cards are being mixed. the cardset is divided into two
halfes and given to the two players. now they have implicit rules,
which are responsible for mapping (combinations of) cards
onto chess parts. 
got the point? this way it would be possible to play the same
chess game with different cardsets. 

ok, following these meta-rules we can use the hidden-axiom you
mentioned before. the luck-part is harder; as chess is a
complete knowledge game, we are not really interested in schemes
like 'luck' or 'random'. but, if we introduce a kind of 'zero moves',
which do not change the state of the corresponding chess game,
then we are able to allow certain 'random moves'.

perhaps this moves could give signals to the other player,
meaning 'how about remis?' or other non-verbal communication stuff.

i know, this isn't a concept but only a collection of ideas;
but concepts can evolve!

I guess you could paint all the regular chess pieces on cards, get
a big enough board, and play chess with your cards :-)

this is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> trivial solution. another one is to have exactly one card
for every possible state of the chess board. every player has a very,
very lot of cards, and the game rules state which card can be played
after another. the overall game structure is very simple, then. you
only have to remember billions of rules and have to be able to carry
many, many cards at once.    :-)
