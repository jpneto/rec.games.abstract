Bear with me as I introduce Korneliussen's Rule (can also call it
Harald's Rule if you prefer), which is based on a post by Harald
Korneliussen regarding how to handle cases where players play a game
and don't know which side has an advantage.  It involves how to handle
choosing sides in a fair way that isn't random.  It is derived from
discussions about Chess960 and how to have it be an acceptable
standard abstract.  Anyhow, here is the post:

In a case, for example, where the

make it fair?  Only way is to have players play both sides.

There is also the way that boardspace.net handles it, by a pie rule.
Make the first move, or even rearrange the pieces as you see fit, and
let the other player decide which side to play. This preserves balance
excellently, and also tielessness.

----------------------------
So, the rule is, in the case of facing not knowing whether or not
sides are balanced, you use a pie-rule as a way to have players pick
what sides they will play.

Well, let me introduce it a variation on Korneliussen's Rule (call it
whatever, like The Hutnik Correlary to the Korneliussen's Rule).  It
involves a case where there is a timing mechanism used.  The variation
states that the starting player removes time from either side, and
then the second player picks what side they will play.  It is a pie
rule for the game clock in cases when it is unknown what side has an
advantage.

Any comments here?  Do people see this as a fair way to balance sides
that where balance is unknown?

When it's appropriate to the game, you can use negative feedback loops
to ensure that a game TENDS to remain competitive even if it is
unbalanced, and even if one player is better or luckier.

We have all seen the reverse situation - positive feedback in games
with exponential growth, where the rich get richer and it's nearly
impossible for a player who falls behind to catch up.  Acquire and
Stock Market come to mind.

Compare "Power Grid", an auction and network game where you pay money
to occupy nearby cities, bid to buy power plants, and must buy scarce
fuel to power the plants. At the start of each turn, you determine who
is in 1st/2nd/3rd position. (Player with most cities is considered
winning; value of best power plant is the unique tie breaker.) For
each action, the winning player gets the worst turn position (first or
last, depending on the phase).  This gives losers an advantage that
may keep them in the game.

These rules also encourage players to take actions that HIDE the fact
that they are winning, an example being that a cheap power plant is
sometimes worth more (and sometimes costs more at auction) than an
expensive power plant. That's not a bad thing, it's just another
interesting aspect of game play. And the general tendency is still to
keep things evened up.
