Right, but the language barrier is significant. I searched the net a
long time for 10x10 boards, and on boardgamegeek forums you also see
several other people asking for it. Right now, I suspect most people
who don't speak French, Dutch or Russian will never find a board
online, even if they go looking for it.

Stock joke comparing the Dutch to the British: they're taller than us,
and their English is better...  All you really have to do is ask.

How do you find a game store?  Well, I put aside my limited knowledge of
practical Dutch and Googled for holland games shop and that led me to a
couple of useful looking places on the first page, especially
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/15712">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/15712</a> which is a list of Dutch
game shops.  Even with no Dutch it shouldn't be too hard to find email
addresses on the sites suggested to ask about a 10 x 10 board in English
(I have some rudimentary Dutch, and soon found a selection of 10x10
boards at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.moenen-en-mariken.nl/producten/">http://www.moenen-en-mariken.nl/producten/</a> with prices as low
as â‚¬6.95 before shipping).

In other words, the practical barriers to a 10x10 board are not being
bothered to spend more than a brief time period armed with a web
browser.  It may be as much as an hour to find one... just how
interesting is it as a game if you can't spend that sort of time?  Just
how interesting is it as a game if you can't get some board and a magic
marker and make up your own? (I have a perfectly serviceable Go
half-board that took the back of a wooden chess board, though a bread
board would have been fine, a carpenter's square and rule and a magic
marker and a bit of time and care to make).

We're not the realm of having to hand-carve the pieces or anything like
that, it looks more like excuses being found to shelve the idea.

Pete.
