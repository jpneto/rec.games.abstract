   OK, a few months ago I saw this fascinating game at a relative's place.
   We found it in a dusty box in the cellar, and I have no idea where
   to buy it, and I've now forgotten its name, along with the phone number
   of my distant relative (who lives in Wisconsin.) So, perhaps one of
   you can help me out.

   The game pieces: over a hundred clear plastic hexagons, a little larger
   than a US silver dollar, and a bag to put them in. Each hexagon has
   thick colored lines (or curves) drawn on it, three or more separate
   curves, which travel from one of the six sides to another side. (Some
   tiles may have more than three curves, and I recall some
   of these curves on the tile go "over" or "under" others... some curves
   may even split, giving you a "y" junction. ) These curves are one of
   three colors: red, white, and blue, and different colored curves may
   be on the same tile. (Although, some tiles only had red curves on them, etc.)

   The game: each player pulls seven (or so) pieces out of the bag, 
   uses them, then pulls another seven from the bag (just like Scrabble?).
   The players take turns laying tiles down on the table, the object being
   to situate the tiles, (by adjoining edges), to form a closed loop of these
   thick colored lines. A player continues to play tiles so long
   as he is extending one particular colored path, or until he uses up all
   his tiles. If the player completes a path to form a closed loop, he gets
   points based on the complexity, length, etc. of the loop.  These loops can
   travel over many tiles, but the loop must be of one continuous color.

   Anyways, it was a fascinating game, and I'd really like to get hold of it.
   Can someone point me in the right direction... a phone number
   for a games store that carries this? The name of this game? Thanks.

I have seen and played similar games.  I can't remember the name
either, but I recall seeing a similar game in the children's games
section of the Wiz, a great game store in Westboro, MA.  To find their
number, call information at 508-555-1212.

I am sure there are big game stores in Texas.  Take a look around.

I hope that this was of some (marginal) help.
