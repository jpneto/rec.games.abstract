I recently read a paper called "Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search" by
Allis, van den Herik, and Huntjens and am very interested in their
algorithm (since I have written a very poor version of this game
myself).  However, they mention another algorithm called the
"Proof-Number Search" which was published in a paper by Allis, Meulen,
and Herik.  Does anyone know of an ftp site where I can get this paper?
Also, is there an ftp site that contains source code implementing
these algorithms?  (I learn faster by hacking).

Proof-number search will appear in one of the next numbers of
Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, I will make it available through
ftp, but have not come around to do it, since it requires some work
to put all in one file. I'll post to this group as soon as it is
available.

About sources for these algorithms. I do not mind making some available.
However, again it requires some work, and I am quite busy right now.
I could try around Easter, but I cannot promise anything.

Victor Allis.

P.S. The go-moku and connect-four papers are available through
     ftp.cs.vu.nl, in directory 'victor'.
