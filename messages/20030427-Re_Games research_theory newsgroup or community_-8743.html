<br>Huh. I never heard of "game researchers" before.

<br>There's actually quite a bit of research on mathematics of games, 
usually listed under the phrase "combinatorial game theory" (classical 
non-combinatorial game theory is more about economics and less about 
games people would play for recreation).
<br>
<br>See e.g. my page <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/</a> for some pointers.

<br>Wow! Nice collection of links. I was wondering if you'd know any magazines or
<br>journals that I could subscribe to about the subject. I'd be much more likely
<br>to find people who would be interested in forming a discussion group from the
<br>audience the publication is targeted at rather than scrambling for people over
<br>usenet. The closest I've found is Abstract Games ...
