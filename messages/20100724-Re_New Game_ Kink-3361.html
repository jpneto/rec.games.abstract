Great-looking game, Nick, and I can't wait to test it.

One thing, however, that makes me a little uncomfortable,
is why do you say this:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
The introduction of a Kink has two effects which I believe will make
the game richer and more strategic
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Now this may just be a mis-match on word usage, but as I see it,
this doesn't necessarily make the game more STRATEGIC,
just more TACTICAL.

I think you said you were bothered (as I am) by games that were
too tactical, and not strategic enough; (Reversi comes to mind).

Of course these two terms are vague.  I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>did<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> post a list
of distinctions once,; but the key elements were that
strategic concerns tended to be GLOBAL and LONG-term,
but tactical ones tended to be LOCAL and SHORT-term.

If we agree on this terminology, do you still insist that Kink
is noticeably more strategic than other N-in-a-row games?
