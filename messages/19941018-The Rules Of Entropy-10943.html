	The board has 25 squares, or spaces, arranged in a 5 x 5 grid,
	represented here as, 

                           S     S     S     S     S
     
                           S     .     .     .     S

                           .     .     .     .     .

                           O     .     .     .     O

                           O     O     O     O     O 

	                   Fig. 1  Starting Position
 
	where S, O represent two sets of pieces of different colors,
	seven to each player. The dots are empty squares.
	--&gt; RULES:
	1. A piece can move only if it is next (incl. diagonally) to one
	of its own color.  When this is satisfied, you may move it any
	number of empty squares, in a straight line, and in any one direction.

	2. If you have a piece that is next to neither one of its own, 
	nor one of the other color, then you are in check, and can play to 
	clear the check only. If it can't be done, you must pass.

	3. The objective is to disperse your pieces so that each one
	ends up next to pieces of the other color only, not their own.

	------------------------------------------------------------------
	EXAMPLES:


	S     .     O     .     S             S     .     O     .     O

	O     .     .     .     O             O     .     S     O     S

	O     S     S     O     S             S     .     .     .     .

	S     .     .     .     .             O     O     S     S     O

	.     .     O     O     S             S     .     .     .     .

	Fig 2. The O side is in check         Fig. 3. What's O's best move?
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Using the algebraic notation (Top row = 5; Left col.= a):
	In the example in Fig.2, the O side is in check, since the piece
	at c5 is isolated. One possible solution is for O to play a4-c4,
	clearing the check and creating one for S at the same time.

	Fig.3 shows S threatening to win with d2-e1. O can preempt this
	with b2-b4, which denies the piece at c2 its connection.

	NOTES:	
	By convention, the O's play first. The easiest way to start a
	gane is to just copy Fig.1 into your editor and proceed from there.

	"In check", as described in rule 2., applies only when you
	take your turn. This means you can put yourself in check in one
	turn, and then clear out of it in the next.
