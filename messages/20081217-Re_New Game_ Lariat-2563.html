 The center cell should be about as
strategically valuable as the average cell - that's the theory anyway.

Though "LARIAT, the winning condition" sounds very interesting at first,
"LARIAT, the game" without Unlur-type balancing, is flawed. No amount of
lengthening the cylinder and/or reducing the distance around will stop the
first player's simple winning strategy:


Take the center then take then mirror the second player's moves.


This will work for any length cylinder no matter how few cells are in the
rings. In your original board, you've got your center "key" cell, a ring of
6 cells and then 12 rings of 12 cells. Instead, use a key cell and then 100
rings of just TWO cells!


Putting an odd number of cells in the rings might make the winning strategy
the tiniest bit harder to state, but just as simple to play. Experiment with
a 1-3-3-3-3...


That center cell can't exist. It is equal to a ring around the cylinder. On
your original board, this is something like a six cell head start. If this
game were played on an half cylinder -- that key cell would be replaced with
an infinite series of rings. Then the game would be fair -- but infinite.
The 2nd player should be able to limit the first player to an infinite open
ended spiral, but never a loop around the tube.


"Andantino" (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/andantino.htm">http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/andantino.htm</a>) addresses
the possibility that even on an infinite hex board, it is simple to defend
against any of your pieces or groups being completely surrounded by the
opponent without some other win condition. Andantino has two win conditions
-- completely surround at least on enemy piece or get 5 in a row. Once a
player takes the center in Lariat, the other player must completely surround
him -- without benefit of some other type of threat.
