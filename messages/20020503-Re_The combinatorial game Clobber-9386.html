Thank you for the suggestions. I will check them out. I don't believe Dots-and-Boxes is considered
combinatorial because the winner is based on number of points, not who goes last.

My main interest is games that are fun to play. If they have a
combinatorial endgame that add to the flavor of the games, such as the
games I mentioned, then all the better.  To what I forgot last time:

Go - Berlekamp seems to like to analyze this one combinatorially. More
fun to play "for real" if you ask me, although the analysis is sort of
nice.

Zertz - This one could be argued about too, but the game has a very
combinatorial flavor, although the formal definitions would not
classify it as a combinatorial game. Lots of positions reduce to a
very interersting variant of Nim.


If you like suggestions of games that are boring to play but
interesting to analyze then I know a lot more ;). Check out the book
Winning ways for example. The book is interestingly enough written
that even if you don't actually find the games interesting, you will
enjoy the book and the analysis ;)
