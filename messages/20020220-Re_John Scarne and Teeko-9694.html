Teeko was the most popular abstract board game of the 1950s in the US.

One of my great finds at a used book store was "Scarne on Teeko" for a buck
and a quarter.  The book was published in 1955.  I had never heard of the
game.

As you note, it seems to have been very popular.  The last page of the book
discusses how "Teeko is Rapidly Sweeping the World".  What caused it to drop
in popularity?  Was some strategy discovered that rendered the game
uninteresting?

A few years ago I wrote a simple and stupid Teeko-program
in Turbo Pascal to get an opponent. It seems to be a pretty
drawish game - although I usually beat it, but only because
it doesn't look ahead, i.e., when I see a possible win there
is often a way to stop it that the program misses. That was
without the tournament rule with larger squares btw. Scarne
apparently could beat all his tournament opponents, but how
trained were they? I don't know, but I'm guessing it might
be too drawish to stay interesting for serious players.

Compare with Dao on <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.playdao.com">http://www.playdao.com</a>   This game is
related to Teeko, and it seems like "everybody loves it",
and they've had tournaments in it, but it is even more
drawish. Check for yourself with my analysis program:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/Dao.java">http://home.hia.no/~jkhaug00/Dao.java</a> - faster as of last
month and now with move retraction. ;-)

And then there's a related game that is not so drawish,
that I have started a few threads about...;-) New readers
are invited to visit my home page for details.
