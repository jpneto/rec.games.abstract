There's chess as an idea with 'checkmate' at its core, and there's
Chess as a game. That's why I call Shakti a 'chess variant' - that is:
based on the checkmate theme - and Grand Chess a 'variant of Chess'.

You can tamper with Chess as a game. Countless people did, including
yours truly. Despite a large number of examples this is a still a very
limited sub-field in the whole field of variants.
Shogi, a renown chess variant, but by no means a variant of Chess, may
well have even more offspring.

Then there's the other 98% of totally different chess variants in
every degree of exotism. Everyone can win! Every try a prize! Come and
join!

Saying Chess is already a study in arbitrariness is really the
understatement of the year.

Fact is the Encyclopedia is out of print and I can fully understand
why.
