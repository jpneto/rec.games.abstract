So here is the new kid on the block: Soar.

Interesting game.  Thanks Christian.  I don't want to be overly critical,
but this is a contest and ultimately I will have to render a numeric rating
for Soar, so a little advanced explanation might be in order.  I like the
elements of Soar - the Hexplode explode, the watermelon seed pinch, the
Dipole/Focus stack movement.  But it all seems like a lot in one game.  My
highest scores will probably go to games with less involved rule sets.

Rules are always clear to the inventor :)
So what should a more advanced explanation cover? The explosion
mechanism comes from a game published by Games &amp; Puzzles Magazine" in
the mid seventies. I also used a hexversion in Mu. 'Hexplode' is
unknown to me.

My problem is usually turning a mechanism into an organism, that is:
give it will and intent (Bill wouldn't know what I'm talking about,
sadly enough he couldn't resist farting all over the thread again). If
you let the rules sink in, you'll find it is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>one<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> organism, and
there's no separation between entering and movement. That's one thing
I aimed at.

The vote doesn't concern me all that much, I think it's a nice game
and once the applet is there, we may actually play it and find out for
sure :) .

My own vote only concerns the other entries (naturally - I don't think
we need a procedure for that).
