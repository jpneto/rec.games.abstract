For example, two like-colored, adjacent perimeter stones would by themselves form a loop.

Then life really would just be too easy :)

What position?

A kind of "interleaved combs" shape. Even allowing filled in loops wouldn't fix this.

I don't know what impartial means.

It is where both players always have the same type of moves available to them. So in this case it would be the ability to place either side's color with each move. Games like Yodd and Produto are good examples.

I don't see why you wouldn't want players filling in their own loops, though I'm far from being an expert in the playing of any game, especially Go.  But it seems like it doesn't change the game at all, especially if you terminate the game when no new loops of either color can be formed.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If players are allowed to have loops surrounding spaces occupied by their own color, then impartial play would be a meaningless option. It would be no different than Hex with the ability to place either color each turn, pointless. With the current requirement, the tactics in impartial play would need loops to surround at least two spaces instead of one, to prevent it being filled in immediately by your opponent. (or you could threaten a connection to a safe loop while simultaneously surrounding only one space, then fill the loop with your opponents color if they cut). 

I am drawn to ideas that allow for more variations. But as i said this was a very tough call for me, and sometimes i certainly think that i should have just had play technically last to a full board, and allowed loops to be filled with their own color (so players wouldn't be forced to kill their own groups in the endgame).

Of course it would be more of a "clump" than a "loop", but as you said allowing such clumps is very unlikely to affect the difficulty of making life in practice... So I just looked into it, and actually there is a tiny chance that such a sequence could occur. Therefore, making life in Loops-F IS ever so slightly easier.

I also really appreciate Atoll, and Cephalopod seems pretty cool as well.

Look at the Begird rule sheet
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Begird is definitely interesting, and i can see how it's related to Loops. A big part of how i came up with loops was thinking about the two primary problems a connection game could possibly have: races and draws. I was thinking about how the "ring" win-condition in Havannah would be super drawish on its own, but defining it the way i have would be super racy. Then it hit me that you could just take racy connection games and use Chinese-Go-scoring to turn them into territory games. (and of course i realized the same principle should apply to n-in-a-row games)

Technically, you could say Hex and Y are Loops variants where one player is guaranteed to get 100% of the territory :)
