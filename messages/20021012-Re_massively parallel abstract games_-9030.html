<div class="moz-text-flowed">It's a dream, I had for mamba when we build the website. As it's a kind 
of cellular automa, the basic rules who define the life of pieces are 
scallable.
<br>
<br>But I think that turn based games don't well suit for massively parallel 
application. The only way was to have an Observer who apply the 
life-rules at a defined rhythm. And players can do any actions, they 
want at any moment (like a real time game). I didn't manage to fix 
serious design pitfalls.
<br>
<br>As this idea motivates me a lot... I think that I will try to design one 
day a very simple abstract game who will be fully scalable... but it may 
stay a dream for a while ;-)

<br>The main problem with such games is that it is difficult for the players to
<br>have an overview of the board. If the player can not see/analyze the whole
<br>board, the game in effect becomes one of imperfect information.
<br>
<br>Another problem is that in a multi-player game in many cases either
<br>1. have the leader bashing problem (i.e. the other players may cooperate to
<br>stop the leader)
<br>2. have too little interaction between the players to make the game
<br>interesting.
<br>
<br>Also, again thinking of an abstract game as a strategic/tactical game where
<br>you can make long-term plans. With multiple players too much changes between
<br>the turns for this to be possible.

<br><blockquote type=cite>I just had a thought.&nbsp; Are there any such games?
<br>Well maybe not on the order of thousands like Ultima,
<br>but how about a game that could accommodate 10 or 20
<br>and yet be purely abstract.&nbsp; At the moment, the most
<br>I can think of is 6-bowl Abalone.
