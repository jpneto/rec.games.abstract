Me too.  Entering a popularity contest using my game as collateral wouldn't
be my idea of fun.

Ok, fine.  Stop endlessly campaigning for publicly voted future contests
then.   "Expert" in this case means the judges know the contest parameters
and they have to read the rule sheets and actually play the games before
voting on them, a lot better than we could expect from an ignorant public.

I don't! lol  I've already made it clear that I believe Dieter's game will
be the best and will probably win.  You'd kill everyone in a publicly voted
popularity contest though, Christian, regardless of the relative qualities
of the entries.

Btw, all of this is rehash.  Both me and Dieter registered our objections to
a publicly voted popularity contest and the consensus was that we'd use
judges.  There hasn't been any new evidence to indicate that future contests
should now be publicly voted.  Alex picking through parts of months old
discussion and reiterating worn out arguments in favor of public voting
doesn't constitute new evidence.

In all seriousness, if you want to have a publicly voted abstract game
contest, do it at bgg.  They're already set up for it with an abstract games
forum, polling capability and tons of public to take the polls.  Why the big
agenda to turn rec.games.abstract into a half-assed bgg Jr.?
