Hello everyone,

This is my first message in this group and I don't usually write/speak in English so, please, be gentle with any possible mistake.


1)-------------------

Some days ago one user of the BGG started a Geeklist with the goal of collect as many paper&amp;pencil games as possible and put them in a PocketMod to get a "survival game kit".

I think it's a great idea and even if I didn't agree with the "as many as possible" mindset (I would rather prefer putting just 8 well selected games) I'm trying to contribute.

You can read all the discussion here:

2)-------------------

As a result of the explained in (1), I've been thinking about a game I discovered long time ago in WOAG. It's credited to Gary Wong, a former member of this group (it seems he is no longer active) and, thus, called "Wong's Game".

You can read the rules here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/wong_game..htm">http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/wong_game..htm</a>

And the original messages here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=pt&amp;fromgroups#!topic/rec.games.abstract/DxV6yf9_uE8">https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=pt&amp;fromgroups#!topic/rec.games.abstract/DxV6yf9_uE8</a>

The problem I find with Wong's Game is that the first phase is waaaaaay too important. I mean, the second phase is just a bunch of races to control territory, but there are always few meaningful options and the decisions can be pretty straight forward in almost all the turns.

Maybe it's just my lack of skill playing this game what impedes me see its real deep. I would be very grateful to anyone who can prove me wrong.


3)-------------------

Trying to find a deeper variation of Wong's game, I've arrived to the following ruleset:

*  The board starts empty and players alternate turns playing pieces in free intersections until fill it up.

*  In his turn, a player can either:

   +  Play a single stone in any free intersection of the board

   OR
  
   +  Play 2 stones in free intersections of the board provided that, in both cases, the stones are touching (diagonally or orthogonally) at least 2 friendly stones (note that in this second case, you can count the first stone placed as a neighbor for the second one).

*  Passing is not allowed.

*  When the board is full the game ends and the winner will be the player with more stones on it.


The idea is to merge the first and the second phase of the Wong's game in order to avoid the drawbacks I've described in (2).

Several questions arise now:

a) Is this ruleset already invented? Can anyone point me a game that resembles what I've described in (3)?

b) Would the game improve if this rule is added? "A player cannot play in any region which is completely surrounded by enemy stones and (possibly) the edge of the board".

c) This ruleset is interesting enough and different enough from Wong's game to deserve a name of its own? Any suggestion?

Apart from this questions I would appreciate as much feedback as possible about this game and, of course, about the idea of make a PocketMod full of paper&amp;pencil games.

Thank you for your attention!
