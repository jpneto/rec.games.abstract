Imagine a reality where you could manage your own unwieldy ego, Corey. 
There you wouldn't have to lumber around colliding with things.

lol, You're really developing a flair for the dramatic, Corey.  I view Rive
as a total success, regardless of how popular it may become.

That wildcard element= low clarity, opacity.

Not exactly.  There's an element of psuedo luck in Rive and if you play well
you'll win most of the time.  It's a lot like Backgammon in that respect. 
You're playing the odds and if you play better, you'll usually win.  You
could get completely wiped out and fight your way back, a few times.  That's
pretty unique for a finite game.  Rive doesn't fit neatly into the
low-clarity-equals-bad-game pigeonhole.

As I said, I still enjoy playing Rive every day, long after the novelty has
worn off.  It's not a stupid, smacking baby blocks together kind of
enjoyment.  There's definitely something to Rive gameplay, IMO.  Otherwise I
wouldn't still be playing it.
