<div class="moz-text-flowed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June 29th, 2003 Announcing the Public Appearance of Xong [tm]!
<br>
<br>&nbsp;i have been keeping this game on ice for awhile, but i have now decided i
<br>&nbsp;cant wait any longer.&nbsp; this is the time, this is the place &amp; this is the
<br>&nbsp;group to finally publicize this game for feedback and criticism.&nbsp; so why
<br>&nbsp;have i been waiting in the weeds, cautiously removing my Lurker Shoes on
<br>&nbsp;isolated occasions?&nbsp; well...i must confess that i have been looking for
<br>&nbsp;a way to make some money with this game.&nbsp; yeah, right.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; it also helps
<br>&nbsp;now to be unemployed and away from an office where the Company could wind
<br>&nbsp;up owning the game by contract &amp; fine print.&nbsp; and i wanted to learn Java.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;so there is no way to make money without a big break.&nbsp; however, i have also
<br>&nbsp;have been thinking about intellectual property protection.&nbsp; by publishing a
<br>&nbsp;game on usenet's rec.games.abstract, thousands of computers around the globe
<br>&nbsp;will get time-stamped copies of this post.&nbsp; you may be able fake photos &amp;
<br>&nbsp;video these days, but dated files on thousands of computers is still hard to
<br>&nbsp;fake.&nbsp; so it's time to Publish! Publish! Publish!&nbsp; All rights reserved!&nbsp; well
<br>&nbsp;...i hope anyway.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong[tm] is an abstract game for 2 players or, in special arrangements, more
<br>&nbsp;players.&nbsp; it is a territory game.&nbsp; Xong was invented in 1996 - seven years
<br>&nbsp;ago.&nbsp; It is a mutant variant of an earlier invention of mine, QuintHex[tm].
<br>&nbsp;QuintHex is played on an order-4 hexagonal grid of hexagons.&nbsp; the pieces are
<br>&nbsp;made of the sides of the connected hexagons and the objective is to rope off
<br>&nbsp;hexagons with legs of your own color so that your opponent cannot place a
<br>&nbsp;piece in a way to make a leg touch your hexagons.&nbsp; there are 12 quintastix,
<br>&nbsp;pieces made of 5 joined legs.&nbsp; each player has a complete set of quintastix
<br>&nbsp;in their own color.&nbsp; you could box out areas of pieces the other player had
<br>&nbsp;already played &amp; get ahead.&nbsp; QuintHex suffered from one of the most common
<br>&nbsp;ailments of abstract games - the first player has an advantage.&nbsp; Xong is a
<br>&nbsp;real candidate solution to this problem, as far as i can see.&nbsp; note: to be
<br>&nbsp;completely above board, i must note that i have unvieled this game right here
<br>&nbsp;in rec.games.abstract years ago under a different name, Zoids.&nbsp; however, a
<br>&nbsp;search on Zoids produced a dinosaur model playset for children - completely
<br>&nbsp;different, but too close for comfort.&nbsp; i was trying to find out what the
<br>&nbsp;australian aborigine word for those dried-up lakes that make a tesselated
<br>&nbsp;caked mud surface and a friend was suggesting "billabong", which was a dried-
<br>&nbsp;up oxbow kind of thing and, POW just like that, the sport clothing line came
<br>&nbsp;out!&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; - so i have renamed my game Xong.&nbsp; Xong is also a vietnamese word
<br>&nbsp;meaning "end of an exam" when i google it, along with various proper names on
<br>&nbsp;other hits.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;currently, the world's best abstract game [IMO] is still Go and will probably
<br>&nbsp;remain so for the forseeable human future.&nbsp; Chess, counting the eastern world
<br>&nbsp;varieties as well as the western world's version, continues to be a very fine
<br>&nbsp;game.&nbsp; these two games suffer from the first move advantage and, in the case
<br>&nbsp;of Go, there are still lengthy ongoing efforts to determine a komi to offset
<br>&nbsp;this advantage perfectly.&nbsp; there are also some poorly worded versions of the
<br>&nbsp;Rules for Go that have led to misunderstandings, especially in the western
<br>&nbsp;hemisphere. Chess has undergone many revisions of it's Rules and, in the case
<br>&nbsp;of western chess, has retained some peculiar features, like En Passant.
<br>&nbsp;Chess suffers from being rather drawish and infact has developed a small
<br>&nbsp;battery of tools to bring to bear when it reaches an impasse or repetitive
<br>&nbsp;gridlock situation.&nbsp; Go has a marvelous defect in it's crystalline Ruleset
<br>&nbsp;regarding the Ko.&nbsp; this defect is truly marvelous, lending a vast rich wealth
<br>&nbsp;of interesting play to the action.&nbsp; but it arises naturally out of the board
<br>&nbsp;&amp; stone patterns.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there are many other noble abstract games out there.&nbsp; r.g.a. knows them.
<br>&nbsp;some of them have been invented by contributors to this group, infact.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong is by no means an attempt to challenge these games.&nbsp; whereas Go has
<br>&nbsp;been compared to an entire campaign of war and Chess to perhaps one of it's
<br>&nbsp;battles, Xong might then be analogous to a swordfight on the battlefield.
<br>&nbsp;typically Go games take hundreds of moves to determine a victor while chess
<br>&nbsp;may take 80 or so moves.&nbsp; Xong takes around 31 moves.&nbsp; i am not sure what
<br>&nbsp;this may have to do with the game's complexity.&nbsp; i find the complexity quite
<br>&nbsp;enough to have kept me up long hours of the night working out variations.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong is a position game, but there is no capturing.&nbsp; Xong never gets into a
<br>&nbsp;repetitive impasse or deadlock.&nbsp; however, Xong also has a defect in it's
<br>&nbsp;Ruleset:&nbsp; at the end of play, when one player is unable to give a new Xoid
<br>&nbsp;to the other, instead, as a means of compensation, he gives 1 point.&nbsp; this
<br>&nbsp;prevents ties, but is philosophically an artificial construct outside of the
<br>&nbsp;geometry of the board &amp; piece patterns.&nbsp; this is called the Xong point.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;you may have noticed i referred to giving new pieces.&nbsp; this is central to the
<br>&nbsp;operation of the game.&nbsp; it is like baseball in that you give a piece to the
<br>&nbsp;other player to play.&nbsp; then after it is played, you are given back a new
<br>&nbsp;piece to play.&nbsp; it's like hitting a pitch.&nbsp; naturally you want to give your
<br>&nbsp;opponent the piece that does the least damage to you.&nbsp; the pieces, called
<br>&nbsp;xoids, begin with the smallest ones and gradually increase in size and
<br>&nbsp;complexity until there is no more room on the board for any new piece.&nbsp; each
<br>&nbsp;piece can only appear once in a game.&nbsp; since secured hexagons are worth 2
<br>&nbsp;points, at the end of the game one player will have an even score and the
<br>&nbsp;other will have an odd score because of the Xong point.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;there are currently 2 active versions of Xong - a Standard game of 61
<br>&nbsp;hexagons arranged in an order-5 hexagonal grid, and a Random variant that
<br>&nbsp;generates random boards of about 57-68 hexagons arranged in one blobby weird
<br>&nbsp;shape that is never the same.&nbsp; the random version might seem to violate the
<br>&nbsp;letter of law regarding abstract games by introducing an element of chance,
<br>&nbsp;but once the board is created, both players are in possession of 100% of the
<br>&nbsp;game information.&nbsp; so nothing is hidden.&nbsp; the Random variation was created to
<br>&nbsp;head off any stockpiling of memorized openings, such as has happened in Go
<br>&nbsp;and Chess.&nbsp; --&gt;Standard Xong already has an Audrey Gambit Declined opening.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;i have a website with some java applets (j2sdk1.4.0_01 applets) for single
<br>&nbsp;workstation play.&nbsp; there are new-window browser links to the 7 rules, a full
<br>&nbsp;example Standard game replayable with a java applet, a table of some of the
<br>&nbsp;pieces, a Standard game playing java applet and a Random game playing java
<br>&nbsp;applet.&nbsp; these playing applets automatically keep a running score &amp; shade in
<br>&nbsp;hexagons for each side, greening out hexes touched by both colors &amp; cashing
<br>&nbsp;hexes* that are roped off as they occur during play.&nbsp; i do not have a way to
<br>&nbsp;play against an opponent live over the net like the go &amp; chess servers do.&nbsp; i
<br>&nbsp;am working on this and hope to unveil the world's first Internet Xong Server
<br>&nbsp;someday soon.&nbsp; also, someday i will implement double buffered imaging to make
<br>&nbsp;dragging xoids around on the board not so blinkety-blinkety all the time.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;you are welcome to check out the game at:

<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;please let me now if there are problems with your browsers or with
<br>&nbsp;the java virtual machine plug-in compatibilities.&nbsp; there will likely
<br>&nbsp;be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> troubles.&nbsp; ;-)
<br>
<br>
<br>* cashing hexes isnt bug-free yet, but bugs rarely occur &amp; when they
<br>&nbsp;do, they can be ignored &amp; the game can continue anyway.
