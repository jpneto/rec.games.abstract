Cool.  Looks good now but I look forward to the update.  When are you
planning to add Oust?  :)  It would actually be interesting to play it
without the convenience of group size rollover.  I.e. having to count your
own stones.

We'll have to catch up on the applets, but first I must get in the
Draughts groove again, because the "On the Evolution of Draughts
Variants" project was interrupted twice, first by two months of
lethargy and next by a couple of intrusive new games.

There's some applet work involved there too (even Draughts itself,
because the Evolution will have alphabetic coordinates throughout).
And Ed makes all the applets, and he does so in his own tempo because
he has his job, and just moved to a new location, and has all sorts of
priorities resulting from that.
But HexOust will be added as soon as possible, that I can promise.
Somewhere during the winter, next spring at the latest, cause that's
the timeline for the whole update.
