The only point I am trying to make here is that procreation is ultimately just an excuse when one accomplishes fuck-all. "Hmm, I did fuck all with my life so maybe this asshole here can immortalize me". I really doubt humanity will care to preserve the resume of sophisticated games I've devised because not unlike yourself yourself they are navel-gazing ingrates. But the salient point here is that if you really want to leave something behind, its better for it to be a groundbreaking board game than some more mouths to feed. And good god, I really hope we don't develop the kind of AI you spoke of because then we would be proliferating consciousness in new and yet more odious ways.
