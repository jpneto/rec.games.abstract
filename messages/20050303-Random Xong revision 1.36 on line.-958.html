<br>Introduction:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong[tm] is an abstract game for 2 players or, in special arrangements,
<br>&nbsp;more players.&nbsp; It is a Territory game.&nbsp; Xong was invented in 1996.&nbsp; I
<br>&nbsp;was trying to find out what the australian aborigine word for those
<br>&nbsp;dried-up lakes that make a tesselated caked mud surface and a friend
<br>&nbsp;was suggesting "billabong", which was a dried-up oxbow kind of thing
<br>&nbsp;and, POW just like that, the sport clothing line came out!&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; - so
<br>&nbsp;i have named my game Xong.&nbsp; Xong is also a vietnamese word for the end
<br>&nbsp;of an exam when i google it, along with various proper names on other
<br>&nbsp;hits.&nbsp; ==&gt; Pronounce that "zong".
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Where Go has been compared to an entire campaign of war and Chess,
<br>&nbsp;perhaps, to one of it's battles, Xong might then be analogous to a
<br>&nbsp;single swordfight down on the battlefield.&nbsp; Typically Go games take
<br>&nbsp;hundreds of moves to determine a victor while chess may take 80 or so
<br>&nbsp;moves.&nbsp; Xong takes around 31 moves.&nbsp; I am not sure what this may have
<br>&nbsp;to do with the game's complexity.&nbsp; I find the complexity quite enough
<br>&nbsp;to have kept me up long hours of the night working out variations.
<br>
<br>
<br>Description:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong is played with pieces, called Xoids, made out of the sides of
<br>&nbsp;hexagons, connected together in a rigid 2-dimensional form that are
<br>&nbsp;placed over vacant sides of a 2-d field of hexagons connected along
<br>&nbsp;their edges.&nbsp; Each Xoid can only be used once.&nbsp; In order to be a new
<br>&nbsp;Xoid, it cannot be rotated and/or flipped over into the shape of a Xoid
<br>&nbsp;already played.&nbsp; As long as the Xoid can be placed over the board on
<br>&nbsp;only vacant legs, any Xoid shape is legal.&nbsp; The object is to wall off
<br>&nbsp;more hexagons than your opponent with legs of your own color.&nbsp; You
<br>&nbsp;neednt fill all 6 sides, but rather just make it impossible for your
<br>&nbsp;opponent to touch any of those 6 sides.&nbsp; If both sides touch a hexagon
<br>&nbsp;it doesnt count for either player and is said to be "greened out".
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Xong is a position game, but there is no capturing.&nbsp; Xong never gets
<br>&nbsp;into a repetitive impasse or deadlock.&nbsp; However, Xong also has a defect
<br>&nbsp;in it's Ruleset:&nbsp; at the end of play, when one player is unable to give
<br>&nbsp;a new Xoid to the other, instead, as a means of compensation, he gives
<br>&nbsp;1 point.&nbsp; This prevents ties, but is philosophically an artificial
<br>&nbsp;construct outside of the geometry of the board &amp; piece patterns.&nbsp; This
<br>&nbsp;is called the Xong point.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;You may have noticed i referred to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>giving<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> new pieces.&nbsp; This is
<br>&nbsp;central to the operation of the game.&nbsp; It is like baseball in that you
<br>&nbsp;give a piece to the other player to play.&nbsp; Then after it is played,
<br>&nbsp;you are given back a new piece to play.&nbsp; It's like hitting a pitch.
<br>&nbsp;Naturally, you want to give your opponent the piece that does the least
<br>&nbsp;damage to you.&nbsp; The Xoids given begin with the smallest ones and
<br>&nbsp;gradually increase in size &amp; complexity until there is no more room on
<br>&nbsp;the board for any new piece.&nbsp; Each piece can only appear once in a
<br>&nbsp;game.&nbsp; Since secured hexagons are worth 2 points, at the end of the
<br>&nbsp;game one player will have an even score and the other will have an odd
<br>&nbsp;score including the Xong point.&nbsp; Thus there cannot be a tie game.&nbsp; And
<br>&nbsp;the gradual increase in size, with jumps located at the 2nd player's
<br>&nbsp;turn, have made this game similar to progressive Chess and also
<br>&nbsp;extremely neutral to the first or second player.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;There are currently 2 active versions of Xong - a Standard game of 61
<br>&nbsp;hexagons arranged in an order-5 hexagonal grid, and a Random variant
<br>&nbsp;that generates random boards of about 57-68 hexagons arranged in one
<br>&nbsp;blobby weird shape that is never the same way twice.&nbsp; The random
<br>&nbsp;version might seem to violate the letter of law regarding abstract
<br>&nbsp;games by introducing an element of chance, but once the board is
<br>&nbsp;created, both players are in possession of 100% of the game
<br>&nbsp;information.&nbsp; Nothing is hidden.&nbsp; The Random variation was created to
<br>&nbsp;head off any stockpiling of memorized openings, such as has happened
<br>&nbsp;in Go and Chess.&nbsp; Even Standard Xong already has an Audrey Gambit
<br>&nbsp;Declined opening.&nbsp; The Standard game is still using an obsolete,
<br>&nbsp;slightly buggy java applet, so i wouldnt recommend trying it right now.
<br>
<br>
<br>Some Elements of Strategy:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;At the beginning you give your opponent the smallest Xoids you can.
<br>&nbsp;There are 19 that touch 5 or less hexagons.&nbsp; The 1st peice is just one
<br>&nbsp;leg, which touches 2.&nbsp; You avoid double touching hexes you have already
<br>&nbsp;touched and you avoid touching the wall around the board which doesnt
<br>&nbsp;count for anybody.&nbsp; The cold value of a move can be calculated by
<br>&nbsp;adding up how many new hexagons it touches for you, how many of yours
<br>&nbsp;it cashes (walls off) and how many of your opponent's hexagons it
<br>&nbsp;touches (greening out that hex for nobody).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;At some point, you may want to construct a long serpentine Xoid that
<br>&nbsp;can only fit around the outside edge where a lot of greened-out hexes
<br>&nbsp;are.&nbsp; I've called these Wall-Crawlers.&nbsp; They can suddenly crop up in
<br>&nbsp;the batting order around turns 15-25.&nbsp; It is best to keep a good eye
<br>&nbsp;out for the conditions where they come into play.&nbsp; A number of times
<br>&nbsp;you may give one of the 19 to your opponent and it will be placed in
<br>&nbsp;a way that creates a wall-crawler situation.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;I've also termed this general concept of the shrinking of possible
<br>&nbsp;playable places Habitat Extinction.&nbsp; Often you can construct a piece
<br>&nbsp;that can only go in one place.&nbsp; Once you have identified the salient
<br>&nbsp;leg shape that accomplishes this, you can then add other legs that
<br>&nbsp;block off access to your hexagons or ruin your opponent's niches by
<br>&nbsp;ballooning the niche into a place that can take many other Xoids than
<br>&nbsp;the one planned.&nbsp; I call that process Festooning.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Sometimes a sizeable area gets left behind as the players cannot bear
<br>&nbsp;to give the other a piece that fits in there for the score it will
<br>&nbsp;make.&nbsp; They instead find wall-crawlers or similar awkward shapes that
<br>&nbsp;cannot go in there.&nbsp; When this happens, i call it a Ko fight.
<br>&nbsp;Eventually someone will get to play in this vacant area, winning the
<br>&nbsp;Ko.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Another development that can occur in the late going will be walling
<br>&nbsp;off a spot that only one new Xoid can fit in.&nbsp; If your opponent gives
<br>&nbsp;you this piece you can play it in some other region of the board
<br>&nbsp;(tenuki) and then that seals the space as is!&nbsp; So you can "remotely"
<br>&nbsp;cash some hexes in this manner.&nbsp; Hence you will probably not be given
<br>&nbsp;this piece for awhile.&nbsp; You can give it to your opponent if the remote
<br>&nbsp;cashing is favorable to you, because then to play it elsewhere works
<br>&nbsp;against the cold value for tenuki and to your advantage, while playing
<br>&nbsp;it in the spot may also be a low cold value.&nbsp; There are other cases
<br>&nbsp;where a spot may have a different value depending on who plays in it.
<br>&nbsp;During the course of the game, you'll want to create as many of these
<br>&nbsp;asymmetrical spots as you can, as long as you're keeping up with all
<br>&nbsp;of the other things going on.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;As the game winds down to the end, there is often an opportunity to
<br>&nbsp;control who will have the last move.&nbsp; Remembering that the player to
<br>&nbsp;gets the last move must then give the other the Xong Point, certain
<br>&nbsp;cool things can happen, if you are paying attention.
<br>
<br>
<br>The Website as of now:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;I have a website with some java applets (j2sdk1.4.0_01 applets) for
<br>&nbsp;single workstation play.&nbsp; There are new-window browser links to the 7
<br>&nbsp;rules, an example Standard game replayed with a java applet, a table
<br>&nbsp;of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of the pieces, the buggy Standard game playing java applet
<br>&nbsp;and the newest state-of-the-art Random game playing java applet.&nbsp; These
<br>&nbsp;playing applets automatically keep a running score &amp; shade in hexagons
<br>&nbsp;for each side, greening out hexes touched by both colors &amp; cashing
<br>&nbsp;hexes that are roped off as they occur during play.&nbsp; The old Standard
<br>&nbsp;applet is buggy still and no longer supported for the current interim.
<br>&nbsp;The random version represents the best representation i have to offer
<br>&nbsp;at the moment and has fixed the bug that led to a rare occurance of
<br>&nbsp;faulty cashing during play.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;I still do not have a way to play against an opponent live over the net
<br>&nbsp;like the go &amp; chess servers do.&nbsp; I am working on this and hope to
<br>&nbsp;unveil the world's first Internet Xong Server someday soon.&nbsp; In the
<br>&nbsp;meantime, i can explain how to play over the net via email and the
<br>&nbsp;java appletviewer.&nbsp; Just ask me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:greystone@net1plus.com">greystone@net1plus.com</a>.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;In order to play this on your web browser, you'll need to be able to
<br>&nbsp;run java applets, either via Java Web Start or by plugins within your
<br>&nbsp;browser.&nbsp; Some browsers can get the applet running, but for some
<br>&nbsp;strange reason, despite all claims to the contrary in the java toolkit
<br>&nbsp;descriptions, the text comes out too small to read.&nbsp; Perhaps screen
<br>&nbsp;resolutions finer than 1024x768 lead to this.&nbsp; perhaps some font files
<br>&nbsp;may be damaged.&nbsp; Xong applets use Helvetica which is a pretty standard
<br>&nbsp;default font.&nbsp; I developed it on my Linux side and can view it fine
<br>&nbsp;there as well as in my Mozilla browser on my Windows XP side.&nbsp; A
<br>&nbsp;brother of mine can view it on a Mac.&nbsp; If you are firewalled off from
<br>&nbsp;the outside world with applets, then perhaps i can work out the email
<br>&nbsp;solution.

<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Scroll down to the bottom and click the Random Xong link.&nbsp; This should
<br>&nbsp;open a new browser window so you can do other things and keep this
<br>&nbsp;active on the sidelines.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;But you should also view the Example Game just to get a quick heads-up.
<br>&nbsp;The commentary in it is ancient.&nbsp; But there are still some points.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;I would like to know if you have any problems AND if you dont
<br>&nbsp;seem to have any problems.&nbsp; Feedback <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>either<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> way is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>good<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.
