I'll just say it: Mark Steere you're the most artful troll I've ever
known. There was one other I've seen who matched you for skill but
lacked anywhere near the stamina. I used to be annoyed, but that
feeling was long ago replaced by a kind of reverent awe. You either
need help or you're an Andy Kaufman level comic ninja. I pray to sweet
baby jesus that it's the latter.

I want to know more.
What do you do for a living?
If I were to go out for a beer with you, would I recognize your
personality, or would you be totally different in real life?
Do you have a spouse? kids?
