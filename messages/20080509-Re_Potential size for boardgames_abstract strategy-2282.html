This is just the electronic variety.  This is a large market.  Should
be enough to justify there being a table games network actually.

There are many, of course. Recently, Arty Sandler of iggamecenter.com
has implemented real-time playable version of a stunning number of
nice, little-known abstracts.

But about market share: If you think Abstracts as something people
have as a hobby, then it's small... but as soon as you branch out a
little, the market grows a lot. Take Gigamic, for instance. How can
they afford to sell fine, polished abstracts in solid wood? Because
they look nice at a coffee table. And the market for coffee table
decorations is so much greater than the market for abstract games,
that if you capture even a tiny slice of it, you double your sales.

(At least that's my theory how a company solely focused on making
expensive-component abstracts can survive)

Whether this causes abstracts to be played more I don't know...
probably a little. But not so much as to be terribly important - it
doesn't turn people into hobbyists.
