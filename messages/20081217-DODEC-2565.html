While thinking about the recent matter of connection games
with cells with vertices of valency greater than 3, and their
connection protocols, the thought occurred to me that for
odd-degree vertices, a simple and play-order-independent
method of decision would be simply, "majority rules".
This is as catchy a phrase as "1st come 1st connected",
and seems perhaps fairer - less obvious advantage to
(say) the first player.

OC there aren't many standard boards with all-odd vertices,
but indefinitely large boards of regular appearance involving
entirely 5- and 7-valent vertices can be constructed.
Perhaps it might be worth thinking about them?

The only board with all-5-valent-vertices is the icosahedron,
and it would thus be possible to play some sort of connection
game on that, (or on the vertices of its dual, the dodecahedron).

With such a small board all games might be too trivial;
but while thinking about it, I just thought, "Well, why not
drop the connections altogether, and make it a pure `majorities'
game, (similar to my `Majority' game on Rognlie's pbem server)".

SO, here it is.  To equalise initial advantage, I have made it
a 1-2-2-2-move game; this modifier often tends to spritz up
(as well as equalise) many regular games, as it happens.
Also, to avoid draws, one needs to remove one of the 20
vertices, which also helps to make it planar-representable!

DODEC
=====
Played on the vertices of a dodecahedron, (or cells of an icosa),
where one vertex has been deleted.

The opening player fills in one vertex with his colour,
then players successively fill two vertices per turn,
until the board is full.

When play has ended, each cell is coloured by
the majority colour of its surrounding vertices.

Whoever has 10 or more cells is the winner.

I've no idea whether it will be trivial or not.

If anyone wants to test try it out,
just email me and we'll get a game or two going!
