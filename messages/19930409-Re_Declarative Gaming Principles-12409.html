Does this fit the category of "declarative game"?

Somehow, it does. Since I am still struggling for a clear-cut definition I
don't really know. That's what I came here for. The big point about decl.
gaming IMHO is, that the player has IN THEORY to be able to access every
bit of data the game is comprised of and change it according to some meta-
rules. Just like in your game of chess. But could I, for instance, intro-
duce new pieces that don't move, but teleport? Could I change the goal of
the game, i.e. what to do to win? And could I change the meta-rules? Like
making a new rule on a roll of 1-6? Like making a new rule about making
new rules?
Questions over questions. You see that a really decl. game can become very
chaotic in no time at all and thus become boring. So, that's why I contend
that a truly decl. game has to be an abstract one, where it doesn't matter
so much when suddenly things turn wild, because there are no interpretations
attached to things.
Or would you believe a wargame, where the tanks suddenly could fly?

Still puzzled, Ulrich
