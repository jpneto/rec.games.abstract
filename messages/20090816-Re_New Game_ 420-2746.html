I particularly like your 1-page game format which is exactly the
format I edit.
Games with simple materials, economic, for families, fast and free. :)

Well, thank you.  :)  It's nice to get some positive feedback,
especially in a discussion group not particularly known for its

Fair comment. I must admit that one of the things I most like about
the abstract games that play is the simplicity of rules. Your one-page
games fit very well. Unfortunately, occasionally corner-cases get
discovered, and rules begin to expand, but that's only natural. (I've
sat on a rules subcommittee for a game played by pedants who love
finding contrived corner cases, and I've seen special cases become 
about 80% of the rules of an otherwise simple game.)

Generic game playing equipment is ideal on a number of
levels, but the most compelling thing about it is that it's exactly
what I need.  Exquisite, fundamental game parts shaped by thousands of
years of evolution.  What proprietary plastic part could I manufacture
that would bear comparison with the Go stone?  Or the checker, or the
Mancala set?  What folly it would be to try.

Perhaps - I've noticed that German ceramic beer-bottle stoppers 
(complete with coloured rubber rings) make great playing pieces! 
A lost one has never been so fun to replace!

The field of abstract
games is inundated with plastic balls, bridges, mushrooms, cock rings,
hair dryers . . .  Let's get back to the basics.

Except on Tuesdays, when mushrooms are valid, but in the afternoon
must be placed upside-down.
