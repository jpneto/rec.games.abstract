12 "steps" in human rated chess players is about right,  there may be
another step or two off the bottom (generally absolute beginners
don't bother to get rated),  but there's a real uncertainty about how
many more steps could exist above the top.  By which I mean,
I believe that in principle a player would only have to be about 2
steps above Kasparov to be unbeatable,  but of course I don't
know that.  Some people believe the number is far higher,
you can piss off a lot of people in rec.chess by bringing up
this question there.

Wouldn't an unbeatable player be an infinite number of steps up? I guess
I'm not understanding this 'step' thing, for instance I'm not sure how
draws are to be handled by the 75% rule.
