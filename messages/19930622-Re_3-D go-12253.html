  Has anyone tried "edgeless" go, for example go played on a normal 19x19
board but with edgewrap top-bottom and right-left.  I haven't but it seems
that it would be a pretty tough struggle.

It seems to me that the only difference in toroidial 19x19 go is 
that without the edges and corners, all areas of the board become 
equal in value.  The difference would probably be most apparant 
in the fuseki; while the middle game would remain mostly the same
and the endgame would have fewer areas to resolve.

	Just a feeling here, but it seems that most of the problems
	one sees are corner and edge problems.  I think this might
	have something to do with boundry effects complicating an
	otherwise "pure" grid.  I would suspect that a toroidal game
	would be less interesting because of the lack of edges and
	corners.

	BTW, I built a 3D go board, must be 15 years ago now.  It's
	still sitting in my closet.

	It is a 6X6X6 board (yes I know, it has no center point, but I
	thought 7X7X7 would be a bit much to start with) made with
	plexiglass levels so you can see (until the games gets too
	close to the end).  I think I played just two games on it, and
	it was devilishly hard to keep track of what was going on.
	Both games tended towards disasterous collapses due to
	3D misapprehensions.  Territories were small,just enough to
	live, as I recall.  It takes a lot more intersections to
	surround a volume than to surround an area.
