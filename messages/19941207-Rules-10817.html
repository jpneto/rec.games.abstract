Hiya all,
I am posting this in an attempt to recruit some more players for
a game I am currently running, called simply - RULES.  Players
simply make up the rules as we go along, and everyone votes on
the proposal from the other players. It is simple and fun, and
can become as complex and interesting as the players make it.
Some of you may recognize the game by the name NOMIC.  It is
often played by both aspring politicians and students in law
schools.  So, if you think you might be interested at all, please
send a message to me at the following address for the rulees of
RULES.  I hope to hear from you.
Email address: <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:m954290@pensacola.nadn.navy.mil">m954290@pensacola.nadn.navy.mil</a>
Do NOT reply to this message, as a friend is posting this for me.
Thanks,
Oscar, The Judge
