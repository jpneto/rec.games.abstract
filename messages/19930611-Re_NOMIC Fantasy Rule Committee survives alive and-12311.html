Since Nomic World has been shut down, the Fantasy Rule Committee is continuing
to function anyway.

As Judge for the current round I hereby open Fantasy Rule Committee membership
to the public at large, beyond the tiny elite of "Registered Nomic Players"
since the registration list does not seem to be maintained any longer.

Work is being done on an automated vote-by-e_mail program (in PERL) so that
Secret Ballots, which seem to be the only feature (aside from playing TAG)
of Nomic-World which canot be moved, say, HERE, can be implemented, and the
current Nomic-World ruleset (all 50K of it) can continue to be further
refined as the apiary nectar of The World's Longest Running Game Of Nomic Aside

People hav until the 16th of june, THE TIME OF DAY AT YOUR OWN RESIDENCE,
to post round 8.1 fantasy ordinances.

Post fantasy ordinances by sending them to The Judge For The Current Round,
currently <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET">DNICOL@UMKCVAX1.BITNET</a>.

The winner, i.e. the last player to not lose by posting an invalid ord or
not posting in a sub-round, becomes the judge for the next round.

	You forgot to mention one small point: to "be valid" means "to 
be consistent with the previously posted fantasy rules."  By the way, does
anyone have the original (regular) ordinances?  Are we still using them or
have we accepted the revision?

	I hope we get some new players out of this.....
Sincerely,
Doug Chatham
