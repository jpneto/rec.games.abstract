A nice website and a fun applet!  I have just one request:  there
probably ought to be a button that you can press to take your move
back.  (For people such as myself who are not very familiar with Tafl
games, it is easy to make silly mistakes.)

Hello everyone,

Just a quick note to let you know that I've improved the hnefatafl game
at "Tafl: An Obsession".  The game is an applet that requires Java.  It
allows you to select whatever combination of rules and size of board you
want to play by, and records the moves as you play.

It now has a computer player, and a couple more options for tweaking the
rules.  The computer player isn't the strongest or fastest out there,
but plays a reasonable game on the smaller boards.  You can control
exactly for how long or how deep you want it to think, so it will play
well in larger games too, for those with the patience to wait.

The site is here:
