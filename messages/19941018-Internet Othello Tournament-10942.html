	**** Announcing the Third Internet Othello Tournament ****

	Date:		October 24th-December ??th, 1994
	Place:		Internet Othello Server (IOS)
				(telnet faust.uni-paderborn.de 5000)
	Categories:	- Open (computers, humans, cyborgs)
			- Human Open (humans only)
	Format:	- human divisions: round-robin
		- open division: double-round-robin
	Entry fee:	None
	Entry deadline:	Preferably by Oct 24th, late entries may be allowed
	Prizes:		Eternal Internet Fame
	Time controls:	30 minutes/player/game, at least one game per week

To enter, send e-mail to me (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:springer@math.umn.edu">springer@math.umn.edu</a>) giving your name, IOS
login, and the division you plan to enter.  Humans may enter both divisions
if they wish, and program authors may enter themselves in the Human Open
division and their programs in the Open division.  However, to prevent
possible conflict-of-interest problems, nobody can enter two different
entities into the Open division.

Potential entrants should take into consideration the time required in
playing these games before entry.  To prevent things from coming to a
stand-still, I'll be forced to remove anybody from the tournament who
is inactive for more than 1 week without contacting me first.  Given the
time requirements, it's likely that the level of competition will be fierce.
I expect to organize a real-time tournament some weekend soon, so if you'd
enjoy playing but can't commit the time required, stay tuned for information
on that.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Colin
