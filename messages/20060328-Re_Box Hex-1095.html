||&gt; How do you come up with just one shortest winning path in Hex? It
||&gt; looks to me that an NxN grid would have N shortest winning paths for
||&gt; each player. Do you agree?
||
||Yes, you are correct.  However more shortest paths go through the
||center point on an odd x odd board than any other point.
|
|Ah, you're right,...


Uh, actually, that's not right. Consider a 3x3 grid.


  A *  *  *

 B *  *  *

C *  *  *
 1  2  3

Considering shortest distance paths only, there are two ways
for the center cell to connect to the top, times two ways to
connect to the bottom, which results in four shortest distance
paths which pass through the center.

Now consider the obtuse corner cell A1. There are four shortest
distance paths which pass through there, as well:

A1-B1-C1
A1-B1-C2
A1-B2-C2
A1-B2-C3


In fact, on any size grid, odd or even, all the cells along the
short diagonal (from one obtuse corner to the other) will have
2^(N-1) shortest distance paths passing through them. The central
cell is NOT a unique maximum in this respect.
