Bill, you wrote:

For over-the-board play 1&amp;2 should be quite sufficient.

There's another consideration as well.  We've noticed in tests that a
simple, boring strategy may be viable in the 1&amp;2 version: place
singletons all over the board with single spaces separating them, and
then lunge for a big group near the very end.  Even that leads to a
very interesting endgame, and it's not clear at all whether player 1
can win this way on a hexhex5 board, but in any case, I don't want
that to be a particularly viable strategy because it's boring in the
early and middle game.  the 2&amp;3 rule may avoid this, although it is
more likely that a pie rule will be needed with the 2&amp;3 rule.

Good point!  I played a few games against myself, and even on micro-
boards
it has that feeling.  I played several on a 3-per-side hex board, and
first-mover seemed to win them all, though even there strategic
variations
loomed up.  On the 5-per-side I'm guessing mucho strategic concerns.

I agree, there are some very cool strategic considerations that loom.
One interesting thing that happens is that the trailing player is more
restricted than his opponent in the moves he can make if he wants to
stay trailing and continue to add more stones than his opponent.  The
leading player can use this fact to his advantage.  I wasn't expecting
that, but it's a big part of the reason that you don't necessarily
automatically want to be the trailing player (which is what I feared,
since the trailing player gets to place twice as many stones as the
leading player).  If strategy evolves such that it becomes desireable
to always be the trailing player, then the 2&amp;3 rule should correct
this.

BTW Nick - for the square-board game, did you envisage diagonals
as being connected, or not?  I would guess not, as otherwise
almost everything would be connectible too easily.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I haven't decided yet.  It's something that I feel deserves testing.
The reason is that you want to make it so that there's a trade-off
between the positional advantage of being the leading player (which
usually means being relatively more connected across the center of the
board), and the power advantage of the extra move.  This balance is of
course affected by the interplay between the connectivity of cells on
the board and how much extra power you get from the extra move.  So,
for example, perhaps diagonal connectivity would work best for the 1&amp;2
move rule (powerful connectivity balancing possibly powerful extra
move), but it's hard to know a priori because without testing it's
hard to how valuable that extra move is.
