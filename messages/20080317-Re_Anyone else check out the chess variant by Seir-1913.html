  It's not quite clear how many hawks and/or elephants there may be on
the board. Is the limit just one of each?  Saying "Whenever a piece in
the back row vacates it spot, the player has the option of entering a
Capablanca piece," makes it sound like as many as eight new pieces per
side could be introduced, which could leave only 16 unoccupied squares
on the board.

Best to go to the links and check it out.  I was doing an abridge
version.  You get one of each of those, and I was explaining how many
enter.

  How did they hit on "elephant" and "hawk," I wonder? "Elephant" was
originally the name given to the piece that moves like today's bishop
in the acient (circa 600-700 CE) Indian game Chaturanga. Capablanca's
names were Marshall (R+N) and Chancellor (B+N). Later Chancellor was
given to the R+N piece, and the B+N named Archbishop. Capa first
proposed a 10x10 board, later changed to 10x8.

I believe Elephant because that was in the past actually.  Not sure
why.  Hawk was related to hunter somehow.

  The idea of adding two such  pieces goes back well before
Capablanca. British master Henry Edward Bird had made a similar
proposal back in the 1870s, and before him the Italian Pietro Carrera
in Il Giuoco degli Scacchi (1617). See D.B. Pritchard's "Encyclopedia
of Chess Variants" for more information.

What is worked on here is doing it on an 8x8 board.  And while those
two pieces are typically what gets add it, the methodology of adding
them is what interests me, and leads a way to make chess a game that
is expandable, while being stable.  Other pieces besides those two
could be added through that method.
