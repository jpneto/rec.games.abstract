No worries.  The only time rule changes invite ridicule is when they occur
every four hours, reliably accompanied by grandiose celebrations of the
game's "final perfection".

A designer can't be expected to "foresee" everything that may unfold in the
gameplay.  One among us claims he can, though he's proven more likely than
anybody to tweak his games.

I like that.

But not that.  Everyone "daresays" that about their game's most recent
incarnation and it's becoming tiresome.  It takes experience to determine if
a game was made deeper, not "intuition".

My rule is: if at the end of the game, the players' largest groups

I don't love that.  It's the obvious way to sort things out in a group size
game with an odd board, but it's too complicated, calculational, and random.
 You're basically trying to form the largest group.  If that ties, then it's
anybody's guess who has the second, third, and fourth largest groups, etc.
