Mark Thompson describes in his homepage a game called "Give &amp; Take":

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/ideal_s_give___take.html">http://www.flash.net/~markthom/html/ideal_s_give___take.html</a>

The game was obviously praised by Wayne Schmittbergerin GAMES magazine
September 1984. However, as Schmittberger caused much confusion in the
English-speaking world by giving incorrect rules for Salta
(see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/salta.html">http://www.abstractgamesmagazine.com/salta.html</a>) and inventing an
"elegant", but wrong solution to save Halma, I am very cautious not to
believe everything he writes.

I admit, I also thought that Ideal's Give &amp; Take is a wonderful game
-- but I erred.

After playing the game many times; I tried out my vicious
"kill-the-game-by-play-for-a-draw method" and it worked.

For instance, if a player puts a piece unto c1, b2, a3, the opponent
must eventually put a piece unto a1. The opponent ends up with two
unconnected groups, which are divided by a chain of pieces (c1, b2, a3).
In the second phase, the opponent cannot reduce his pieces to a single
piece (i.e. he cannot win) as long as the chain exists. For that reason,
the player with the chain can force a draw.

Well, this isn't a "solution" because the opponent can put a piece unto a3
or c1, before the chain is formed and in so doing spoil the draw.

However, this example points to a strategy which ensures a draw. In fact,
Give &amp; Take is kind of a connection game, but you don't win by making a
connection (from edge to edge), you force a draw!

The strategy to achieve a draw is:

==========================================================================
Every player who forms a chain of diagonally adjacent pieces, which touch
the edge, either with the corner or the side of a square, at two
different places (thus surrounding an unoccupied square or a piece of
the opponent) during the first phase of the game, can force a draw,
if he has another piece which cannot be immobilized or forced to move to
a square orthogonally adjacent to his chain.
==========================================================================

This is far less complicated as it sounds. In actual play such a chain
appears not too difficult to form, even if one player tries constantly
to prevent such a chain, i.e. a drawn game.

One could try to save the game by declaring that a player who makes a
chain loses (in contrast to Hex or Y where the player making a chain
wins). However, I'm afraid that in this game, a player can be forced
from the very beginning (after some analysis has been done) to make a
chain, i.e. to lose.

Probably, Ideal's Give &amp; Take is hopelessly flawed.
