Ok, I think I have understood your goal now.

Some questions:

When and how will your abstract games project be available?

What is your motivation for describing games in terms of the final goal,
don't you find the players' perspective of what do to more interesting? [I
certainly think the means of achieving the goal and the strategy are more
interesting than the final goal. I also think that a book that would
interest new players in the games is more interseting than a pure
classification.]

What games do you find most interseting after classifying 120 games?
