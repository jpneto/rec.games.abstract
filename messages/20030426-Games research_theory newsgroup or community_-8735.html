<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hello everyone,
<br>
<br>I'm looking for an Internet games research or theory newsgroup/"community". The point would be to discuss 
mathematical/computational properties of existing games, proposals for new games (and their properties), game models and 
formalisms, academic aspects of enjoyement (what makes a good game? why do people play games, etc.), how computers can 
contribute to research in games (note: this is different than talking ABOUT computer games!), computational rationale, 
communication/collabaration in mult-player games, etc. etc.
<br>
<br>I'd like for it to be a discussion group.. not a serious of web pages containing information that I can easily look up 
on Google. I think interest in the subject is most definitely growing worldwide, and I'd like to meet new people 
interested in this.
<br>
<br>If not, would there be anyone interested in helping create a group like this (ie. start by telling me how to do this) ?
<br>
<br>Marc
