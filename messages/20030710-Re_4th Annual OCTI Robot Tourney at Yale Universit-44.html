I hadn't looked at your website for a couple of months. After I saw this
post I did. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Java applet robot capable
of playing Octi (formerly Octi for Kids). I'd never played Octi before,
since I'd owned Octi Extreme (formerly Octi) for over two years. At first I
was put off because I wouldn't be able to use the superprong and the endless
board of the game I was used to. And I scoffed after I won the first two
games I played. Then I noticed the difficulty setting. It began on level 5.
I moved it to 6, still too easy. But when I put it on 7 the robot won nine
of the next 12 games. I scoffed no more. I'd found my niche.

Anyway, thanks for this addition to your website. I hope that sometime in
the future you'll have a robot for Octi Extreme.

Hi, Michael.  There is currently a robot on-line to play Octi on both
a 9x9 board and a 6x7 board.  If you go to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a> and click
"play Octi-X on line" you meet a few robots.  "Casbah" (last year's
bot tourney runner up) is playing just 6x7.  "testme" plays both. 
"testme" -- last year's bot tourney winner -- currently plays just the
one-base version of the 9x9 game.  If there's interest, we can put up
the 3 base program, although it's not nearly as competitive.

Cheers,
Don
