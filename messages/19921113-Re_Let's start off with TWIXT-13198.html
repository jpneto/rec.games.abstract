Not a draw at all!

Quite right.  I originally meant to draw the correct draw, but on the
awkward grid I made, the diagonals wouldn't work right, so I changed
the position to something I could draw, not noticing that the new
drawing was no longer a draw.

Anyway.  Yes, draws are possible on any size board larger than 4x4.
Build a draw by extending the arms of the "square knot" to the board's
edges.  Note that a chain of N bridges in a fan-fold shape can span
any horizontal distance between N and 2*N, by flexing some folds
between the smaller and the larger angle.

(Puzzle: Take a chain of N bridges and put one end at (0, 0).  Where
are all the places the other end can be?  Related puzzle: Given a
point (x, y), what's the shortest chain that will connect it to the
origin?)

How can we make draws illegal in Twixt?  Consider this rule:

A player is not allowed to make a move that completely blocks off his
opponent, if the move doesn't win.  So, for example, in
   .   b   X-_ .   .   .
              --__
   .   O   .   a  -X   .
      /
   . / c   .   .   .   .
    /
   O   .   X   O-_ .   .
          /       --__
   .   . / .   .   .  -O
        /
   .   X   .   .   .   .
it's illegal for X to move on the square marked "a", but it
would be legal if there were an X on "b".

Now, note also that it's illegal for O to move on square "c".  This
raises the question: does there exist a position where prohibited
moves are the only useful moves a player can make?  If so, then this
position is also a draw.  In that case, we would need either a
stronger or a weaker anti-draw rule.
