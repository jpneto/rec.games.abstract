  There were 3 rows, containing 3, 5, and 7 units each. A player would 
remove as many as desired from any one row. The player forced to take the 
last piece was the loser. Unfortunately, an optimal strategy existed, and 
if a person went first and followed the strategy, there was no way that 
player could lose!
  Alternatives had either more rows, or more pieces per row. I had a 
small plastic set that had tabs that flipped from one side to the other. 
I won a LOT of bets with that one! :)
