But then I'm thinking about it and it starts to get a little "weird". I mean 
for

Not true.  Imagine a timer with 1m20s in it.  You flip it, you have
1m40s.  You flip it again a couple of moves later, no problem.  Right?
In general, you probably want most of your pieces somewhere near the
middle.  An actual game tends to have an unusual pace; most moves are
leisurely and relaxed, with occasional flurries of lightning-fast moves
as someone's timers get low.

A few notes on the subject of timing:
- note that you can always guarantee at least 30 seconds for your move.
If you start the timer during your opponent's move, he can't flip it
again until it runs out.  One sneaky trick is to flip the timer at the
end of your opponent's move, just as he starts to move his piece,
guaranteeing yourself a full 30 seconds for your move.
- this means that if, at the end of your move, you have a piece with
less than 30 seconds left, your opponent can kill it.
- this means that if, at the end of your move, you have 2 pieces with
less than 1 minute left, your opponent can kill one of them.
- this means that if, at the end of your move, you have 3 pieces with
less than 90 seconds left, your opponent can kill one of them.

Of course, the action on the board and the sand in your opponent's
pieces may mean that it isn't in his best interests to kill your piece,
but that's what I love about this game - you're trying to balance the
sand in your timers against the sand in your opponent's timers against
the position on the board, ... there usually comes a point where you
need to sacrifice a piece to block your opponent from your territory, or
kill one of your opponent's pieces.

Sneaky trick in the opening; as second player, play fast, and hope your
opponent does the same.  On his fourth move, he has to flip something
back, preferably with just a few seconds of sand in it.  THEN, take your
time :)

As for the actual strategy of play, as I said, I try to wall off
territory that I can reach and my opponent can't; this is easiest to do
along the second line, but depends on the opponent's play, of course.
Once you have this territory, you want to save these moves for the end
of the game, when your opponent's pieces are paralysed.  So, the piece
that will be dropping rings in these spaces should be moved as little as
possible before the finale; which means you want to move quickly... and
your opponent wants to move slowly to force you to use these spaces up
while he can still drop rings.  This also means that territory taken at
the start of the game is worth less than territory towards the end of
the game (in fact, the effect is exaggerated because you tie up a piece
with that territory).

Here are a few snapshots from a game I started playing by e-mail, but
which was never finished... the rules here allowed anywhere between 1s
and 15s per move.
