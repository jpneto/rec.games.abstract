For those of you that play Gipf with the tournament rules, how many Gipf
pieces (that's two basic pieces stacked) do you usually use before you start
bringing on the basic pieces?

I've been playing Gipf about two months with the basic and then the standard
rules.  But I just began using the tournament rules this week.  And in the
five games I played this week I used six Gipf pieces (and therefore six
basic pieces) in four of those games.  This seemed about right to me.  But I
wondered what more experienced players thought.
