<br>It's important that the coin is tossed in the drawn position, not at

<br>and that 80% of games are draws (I think it's slightly less than

<br>That's a very good point.&nbsp; The only situation where one is `forced' to
<br>watch a draw is in a match, as distinct from a tournament.&nbsp; However,
<br>in a match, it doesn't matter whether draws are scored at a half-point
<br>each, a third of a point each or even twenty points each.&nbsp; Only an
<br>asymmetric scoring system for draws would affect matches.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's a matter of simple efficiency. If contested games are
<br>more interesting than uncontested or partially contested
<br>games, then chess becomes more interesting as the
<br>average contestedness of all games increases.
<br>
<br>You are correct about alternate scoring not working
<br>for matches, though, since the idea behind alternate
<br>scoring is that the players who fight for wins will gain
<br>advantage over those content to draw. If there are only
<br>two contestants, there are no other players to consider.
