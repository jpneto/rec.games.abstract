I love phases in games, but only if they arise
naturally, not if they're forced by the rules.  Like first you fill up the
board, or add so many pieces to the board, and then the rules are different.
This is an aesthetic problem for me.

It's only a problem if you can't get around it. It was precisely to
problem that presented itself in Soar.
I agree 100% with your considerations, so I let it sink in till it
solved itself in the most natural way: there are two stages in Soar,
one where a player has still one or more men in hand, and one where
that is no longer the case.
Moving (as opposed to entering) is allowed in both phases, so the
'division' is only rooted in the fact that both may at some point
have
entered all their men - the rules remain the same throughout.
