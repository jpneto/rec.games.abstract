Some stone placement games with passing option can be easily made
drawless with the following obvious rule: in case of a tie, the player
who passed first wins. Of course, the suitability of this rule depends
on some features of the game, e.g. whether the length of the game and
the number of moves per turn are fixed or not.

Christian, I was just wondering why you decided not to implement this
rule in Sygo, as it seems to fit this particular game like a glove.
Thanks to the highly variable number of stones placed on each turn,
both players would have equal chances of ending up passing first, so
the game would still be perfectly balanced for both sides.

And it's a fair rule, as it rewards the player who spent the least
moves to score the same points.

Sygo is already a great game, but why not make it a great drawless
game? Just a suggestion :-)

Thanks for the compliment and the suggestion :)

For context: I'm holding a flexible position regarding draws. Why did
I cut them out in Symple and not in Sygo?
Intuition I guess. Although the architecture differs, Symple in it's
spirit is a lot like Hex. It's quintessential, deep and not structured
for volatility and drama. Having a game with no particular emphasis on
those aspects end in a draw may feel like an anti-climax.

In Sygo a draw will be a rare event and never devoid of drama.

I agree that the rule 'fits like a glove', but it <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> an extra rule,
and it is 'wearing its intent on its sleeve' as Nick put it. The
intent is to eradicate the draw in a system that doesn't particularly
suffer from it. A draw in Sygo may well be a satisfactory outcome for
both. So I don't see draws as the bogeyman of game inventing.
Depending on the nature of the game, a small margin may even give it
more style, I feel.
That's an opinion not shared by everyone ;-)
