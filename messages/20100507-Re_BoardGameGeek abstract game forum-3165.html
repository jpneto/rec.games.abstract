What have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> ever done to advance abstract games, Rich?  You're not
promoting abstract games.  You're promoting Richard Hutnik.  That's
what you're promoting.  The only thing you're doing with abstract
games is exploiting them.

Oh stuff IAGO has done is show up at game convention and run abstract
strategy game events, teaching some teens interested in Go how to play
Go (Nintendo DS filled in well there).  Stuff like getting abstract
strategy games (like Diamond Bridge, a Hex variant) to an after school
youth program involved with troubled youth, so that they find other
stuff to do, besides end up in the court systems again.  Small things
like that Mark.  It doesn't matter who does it, but it was done.

I would HIGHLY suggest you not get into who has done more Mark,
because you haven't done anything.  And there is plenty you could do,
besides just create games.  I have created a lot of games to.  And
Mark, it is certainly hard to get the world to care about abstract
strategy games unless you can get a clue as to how to get the world to
care more about them as a genre.

Your whining is immensely tiresome.  As far as any games that would be
exploited, I personally would rather exploit poker and get chess next
to it, than use abstract strategy games, for something else.

And Mark, they are "abstract strategy games".  Abstract games is some
sort of shorten name that people used that the world has no clue as to
what they are and tend to want to stick dominoes into.  Want to know
why BGG does what it does?  Because they think every game without
theming is abstract, and if it involves even a bit of strategy, the
world says it is an abstract strategy game.

- Rich

By the way, as far as promoting anyone Mark, how is your fan base?
Why not keep people posted on how many awesome fans you have that
actually like you.  Yes, keep up the calling people all sorts of
profanity and believe the world will like you.
