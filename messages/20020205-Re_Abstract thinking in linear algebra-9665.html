This semester I'm taking Physics I, and similarly I'm glad I had Calc
III. The requirement for Physics I is that Calc I be finished or being
taken concurrently.

I too was working and spread my college courses out over a number of years.
Both Physics and Calc came a lot easier for me if I took the Calc before it
was the Physics requirement, not concurrently. Only the first year did I
take the two concurrently as the full time students were, and I found it to
be much more difficult that way
