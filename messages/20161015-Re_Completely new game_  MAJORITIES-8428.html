TO ALL ABSTRACT GAMERS
======================
Here is, I believe, a rare chance to be in on the ground floor,
not only of a new game, but of a whole new FAMILY of games!


MAJORITIES is a new type of game, with exceptionally simple rules,
and bearing little relation to other games as yet.  Many variants
(including a very natural 3-dimensional version) are possible.

It is based on the fact that in politics, or committees with
sub-committees, a minority of people, in critical places,
may nonetheless carry a voting motion.  I have long felt that
this is a weird situation, though a moderately common one
in close elections, where the winner can often have obtained
less than half the total vote.

I have devised this family of games to illustrate this phenomenon,
and have tested it to a considerable extent with other players.
The basic 2-dimensional game is described below, and is now
implemented on Richard Rognlie's pbem server, courtesy of
the indefatigable Cameron Browne, one of the server's
chief implementers.

It seems to be a game of considerable depth, where one must try to
identify the "most urgent" points to play, and seize those first.

RULES
=====
  The board is initially empty. Player-1 places a stone on any cell
  of the board, then player-2 places 2 stones; and they continue
  in turn placing 2 stones at a time, until someone has won
  a majority of directions.

  Getting a majority (e.g. 4 of 7; 3 of 5) of stones in a line
  wins that line; winning a majority of parallel lines in some
  direction wins that direction; winning a majority of directions
  (i.e. 2 or 3) wins the game.
====

Apart from settling the shape of the board, that is all there is to
it!

Please note that the 1-2-2-2-... number of moves per turn is
quite vital, otherwise it would be an enormous advantage to start,
far more so than in most other games, and no simple "swap"
equalization is possible.

A very simple and natural 3-dimensional variant is to have a 3x3x3
cube,
with the initial goal being to win 5 or more points in a plane,
then 2 or 3 planes in one direction, then 2 or 3 directions.

                / |
              /   |           three directions:
            /     |
 ______|   ._|_____     1 horizontal,
|           |   |           |    2 vertical away from us,
|      ___|   |___      |    3 vertical across view.
|     /   |/        /       |
|__/    '        /_____|
  /________/  |
           |        !
           |      /
           |    /
           |  /
           |/

In two dimensions, we play on a hexagonal board, where
there are three very obvious directions in the plane -
horizontal (zero slope), sloping upwards (positive),
sloping downwards (negative).

Note that one must win not MORE lines than the opponent,
but merely more lines in any two directions.

The size of the board refers to the number of cells along the edge.
The server only supports three sizes of board, size 3, 5 and 7.
At first I thought that the board size would <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>have<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to be odd,
to ensure the vital matter that there must be an odd number of
items in every category, to allow clear majoroities and
prevent ties.  However, as some cells have to be removed
from the board anyway, it has been observed (by someone on
the server - forgot who - apologies to that man!), that
even-sided boards are also possible, as long as some corner
or edge cells are among those removed.

But anyway, here are the basic boards:-

The default size board is 5, shown here...

      .  .  .  . .
     . # .  .  .  .     The cells marked # are NOT on the board;
   .  .  .  .  .  .  .    they are effectively holes in the board;
 .  .  .  # .  .  .  .   they cannot be played in and do not
.  .  .  .  .  # .  #  .  count towards the final scoring.
  .  .  . #  .  .  .  .
    .  .  .  .  .  .  .
      . #  .  .  .  .
       .  .  .  .  .

   Here is a board of size 3...
       . . .         This very tiny board is probably susceptible
      . # . .        to a complete analysis, (but possibly not).
     . . # # .
      . # . .        It would make an excellent starting size
       . . .         for two beginners to get the hang of the game.

The same pattern of blank cells follows all sizes; here is size 7...

      . . . . . . .
     . # . . . . . .       Note that IN ALL CASES
    . . . . . . . . .      there is an odd number of rows,
   . . . # . . . . . .     and every row has an odd number of cells.
  . . . . . . . . . . .
 . . . . . # . . . . . .   This is vital, so that every line
. . . . . . # # . # . # .  can have a clear-cut "majority" winner.
 . . . . . # . . . . . .
  . . . . . . . . . . .    The lines are in three possible directions;
   . . . # . . . . . .     NE/SW, NW/SE, horizontal.
    . . . . . . . . .
     . # . . . . . .
      . . . . . . .

Finally, here is a completed game on the size-3 board:

b   b   a   a   b  &lt;--- Winner of the NW/SE lines
 \   \    \     \     \

              A    B    A        line won by a

            A    #   A    B     line won by a

         B    B   #    #    B   line won by b

            B   #   A    A      line won by a

              B   B   A          line won by b

 /   /   /   /   /
a   b   a   b   a  &lt;--- Winner of the NE/SW lines

So we see that A has won the horizontal direction;
                and B has won the downwards direction;
                and A has won the upwards direction;

So A wins the game, 2 directions to 1;
even though B has played more stones.

Have fun with the new game!   Good luck to all.

You have 10000 years of mental retardation.
Maths!!!???
Do you that this is going to impress me????????
I know many mathematician at high level who are in fact deeply dumb! 
I know few illiterate guys and women who are hugely smart.
When it comes to the game design the mathematical knowledge WILL NEVER REPLACE creativity. NEVER!!!
