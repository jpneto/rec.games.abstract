No, that's not why your reason is stupid.  Your reason is stupid because
you're trying to dredge up already discussed, already resolved issues -
discussed and resolved among the contestants and the contest organizer -
based on the few bits and pieces of the discussion you've read.  The problem
you're having, in a nutshell, is relevance.  You need to take an hour and
actually read the discussion in its entirety.  I think you'll find that all
of your questions have been asked and answered already.

Two major items you're determined not to acknowledge, no matter how many
times you're told:
  1. There's a long standing consensus that the loosest possible definition
  of stacking games should be used in admitting games to the contest.  So
  your huge semantic analysis below that I look forward to snipping out
  about what you consider to be a true stacking game is totally irrelevant.
  2. Daniel, the contest organizer, has agreed with the contestants that the
  games will be judged solely on their quality of play.  Period.  Settled. 
  Stop dredging up old, resolved issues.

If a game isn't qualified for the contest then it shouldn't be admitted in
the first place.  You don't admit a game while giving it a black eye.  You
either admit the game or you don't.  Once admitted, each game has equal
standing with every other game and will find its place based solely on its
quality of play.

Alex, I invited you to rec.games.abstract and I'm glad I did.  You are an
expert on games.  You're the best Monkey Queen player, even though you
ceaselessly complain about Monkey Queen.  Your demonstration of how version
1 could become overly defensive helped spur me to come up with version 2.  I
think you have a lot to contribute to the discussion here in
rec.games.abstract and I sincerely look forward to hearing what you have to
say about the games in the contest when the time comes.

But, that being said, you will not be a judge in this contest or in future
contests.
