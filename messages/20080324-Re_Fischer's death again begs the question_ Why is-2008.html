What I mean is I would like to see a form of chess that is played
where it grows so diverse and deep in opening theory and so on, that
it becomes hard to actually name the lines of play.  You can talk
about general areas, and finding general theory, but not to where you
start doing stuff like, "Queen's Gambit Decline, with the Slav
alternative, and a fill twist, complete with a pickle".  Yes, that is
made up nonsense, but I am doing it to make a point, and at least get
a groan out of it.  I would like for a version to be something where
innovators and creative players can uncover new things early in the
game, rather than later.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I recently interview Mickey Adams, and he answered one question with that 
sort of answer - he can still find early innovations. But the thing of it 
is, most players don't even know the first 12 moves of many Openings, or 
sub-variation. Perhaps they know half a dozen variations, but there are 
hundreds of possibilities. So, opening knowledge has only a small influence 
on the result of the game for 99% of players, in my opinion, which is also 
the opinion of one of the best chess teachers in the USA, Dan Heisman.

The issue so often is, not just knowing 12 moves for white, but what to do 
if black deviates at move 7? Or even noticing that black's seventh move is a 
deviation! Is it a side-line, an alternative move in this position, or is it 
a mistake? Very few people can answer that when they are playing over the 
board.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 If I had my druthers, I would have a version
of chess that, right when the start to write books to explain openings
and do minutia, we change the rules somehow to mix it up.  This way,
you can keep the book writing business busy, and offer a gravy train
for all the chess book writers, so they don't run out of things to
write about :-).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

But I think its not necessary to do so! An illustration is that for 20 years 
I opened 1.b4 and can't remember any game that was similar to any other even 
at move 10.

These days I play lots of Sicilians, and a relatively well-trodden Pelikan. 
Even so, its hard to find two similar games to move 10. I even like to play 
against the Pelikan, and play a slightly obscure side-line pushing a pawn to 
a4, so that black cannot play the usually freeing b5, and thus the c4 square 
is open for bishop or knight. But people's responses to this 'strategic' 
move are all over the place.

Therefore, in actual practice, I don't see anything being played out in 
chess for 99% of players, not even by move 10.

How about the same game that was played in the 18th century?  Well,
that would mean you wouldn't be using the point system and time
controls.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True - but the play of the game would be the same. The only difference is
that few people in their right minds would sit down for an indefinite 
amount
of time to play chess.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The introduction of time control and the way scoring was done, did
change things.  Anyhow, that is a bit of the point, chess will either
change and adapt and you don't play the same game in the past, or it
will have the word "SOLVED" dumped on it by some game theorist and
then it loses its luster some.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I doubt it. There are many theorists of chess who can't actually play the 
game when there is a real opponent opposite them. And chess, it must be 
pointed out, is not a theory, but more like a performance art. I can't beat 
grandmasters, but that doesn't put me off playing, and their knowledge is 
very considerable indeed - but so what?

Draughts [checkers] is 'solved' by as many people play now as they ever did.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
 It ends up in the place that Checkers
has been, which has done different things to keep the game around by
introducing different things to mix up the openings (think like how
Chess960 works).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Fischer Random or 960 didn't catch on any more than any other chess variant. 
I wonder if chess variants emerge because their inventor is personally 
stuck, and then it appeals to other game players who are also stuck?

Instead of getting through their block they give up the game - and excite 
another similar one as 'better' - but I distrust the psychology of that. I 
can understand someone giving up chess for Go or Bridge or even Poker, but 
to play Hobbit-Chess or some doodad-thing? Very questionable!

I know the answer to that - being one of the few people who ever made a 
tv
program about chess. A live event with 8 GMs in it, and 2 world 
champions -
and for 2 hours. I know what was right and what was wrong - and maybe you
have to do it to know that?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I can share some ideas offline, as I am currently in discussions with
different video studios that do television to work to get chess and
other abstract strategy games on TV somehow.  I will say that the
pacing needs to be, AT MOST, spread apart like American football
between moves, preferably have the scoring to be less draw-prone, and
have it so the presentation puts you in the heads of chess players
playing, complete with reality TV drama.  You DON'T show it live, and
you do reality TV editing.  Go to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.iagoworldtour.com">www.iagoworldtour.com</a> and get my
email address from there.  You can do that.  You can also look here
going with iagoworldtour.com as the domain name @ before it, and then
go with rich.  Pardon this being cryptic, but I don't want some email
harvester to pick it up.  Please contact me regarding this.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Understood. But this is my e-mail in the header. Maybe write to me instead. 
After all, I did it already, and already made most of the mistakes 
possible..

People always have their excuses for doing nothing. What is more boring 
than
American football with 1 minute of actual play in every 10? But American
media makes that work, so they can certainly make blitz chess work!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

People have been acclimated to football, and it has its pacing down
for it. They do enough between plays to do it.  I believe you actually
can learn how to make chess work, by studying how the do American
football.  I am of the belief that blitz chess is too fast, so it has
a problem with pacing.  I would say here, if you want heresy, Bughouse
would make for good TV.  You might even do a simul game where you have
3 grandmasters play each other all simultaneously by use the of the
computer.  There are 3 or 6 games going on at once, and the
grandmasters have to be able to manage all the clocks of all their
games.  They play it over the computer, rather than a live board.  But
live you could do two players, each playing two boards against each
other, Bughouse style.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes - these are a few ideas - there are many more.

Some time ago I was looking at reviews of a computer game and found a 
recorded conversation between two-beta testers, girls aged 9 and 10. They 
said they liked the game because [I paraphrase] its episodes took a long 
time to play, it was hard to play so that you couldn't get good and exhaust 
the possibilities too quickly, and that it was very complicated!

Unless a scoring system encourages playing for wins, why would people
not play cautious and hope for an opponent mess up?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed. Especially these days when you are paid just to show up. But 
still,
is this for top players only, or for all players, in your opinion?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Let's just say this.  The average joe who plays chess, isn't going to
be using clocks, worrying about scoring, touch moves, etc...  They
will just play a game.  In a club, they will play with clocks, maybe
some speed play.  You need to worry about the top players, and how you
do that.  They are supposed to be the stars that get people
interested.  If you can get the highest level to work so it isn't
overcautious, then you can transfer it down to lower levels.  Making
tournament structure stronger doesn't hurt to migrate the ideas down.

Please get in touch with me via the info I gave above.  I would like
to hear your ideas.  I am on a mission to get abstract strategy games,
as a group, to end up where poker is now, in regards to money, and
media recognition, and being a permanent fixture on TV.  I will say
that there are things at work, partly due to the Sudoku craze, that is
making this favorable.  It is just no one has shown that you can get
abstract strategy games to work on TV.

Or to work for long... there are a few precedents.

Anyway, thanks for writing.
