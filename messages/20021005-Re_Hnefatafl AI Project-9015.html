<br>Heheehe-- it won't be easy but it sure will be fun! We don't have to worry that much, there's 
actually quite a but of math theory that makes things way easier for us.

<br>heehehhe I'm not coding this in machine language :) But that certainly will help.

<br>Thanks again. Do you know if there exists a web version of the game (Hnefatafl) somewhere?
