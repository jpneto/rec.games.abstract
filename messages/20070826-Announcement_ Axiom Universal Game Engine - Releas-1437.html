If you are interested in programming abstract strategy games, puzzles,
and a variety of other related applications, you might be interested
in "Axiom".  Axiom is a universal game development system that works
in conjunction with the "Zillions Of Games" (tm) product.  It is in
the form of a plug-in DLL engine for Zillions.  Axiom has its own
complete Forth based scripting language as opposed to the built-in
Lisp like language included in Zillions.  Axiom provides its own
search engine, allows the game AI to be customized, supports math, and
in general, allows a high degree of customized programming.

You can find the Axiom development kit (which includes documentation)
along with several Axiom based games at:

Also, there is a yahoo group dedicated to Axiom:
