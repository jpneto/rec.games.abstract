That's a typo right? It's "vacated by the hunter" I presume. If tiles were used for civilians (like in Shakti), you'd be rid of the displacement rule altogether.

Yes, that was an error. I've made the rule slightly less formal in favor of it making a bit more sense.

Neither am I, a simplification may yet present itself. Disregarding that, this looks like a nice game in that particular category of minimal equipment games. Some will be nauseated by the possibility of draws (or worse, all lose ;-) but I actually like them if they're not too intrusive :)

I considered making the rule that if one player gets eaten, the other wins, but under the rules of the game I was playing there couldn't be multiple win conditions. Flavor-wise I think "everyone loses" makes the most sense.
