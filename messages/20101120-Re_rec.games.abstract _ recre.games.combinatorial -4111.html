Well, that's pretty much the clearest sign that Stark Mere
sees himself chiefly as Freeling's cocksucker.
He certainly likes to behave that way!

Is Christian Freeling really EIGHTY years old!?

I never guessed that.  He certainly has been designing games
for a long time.   Almost....

But no, this is not the place to denigrate an old man who has
done his time in the trenches, and made a name for himself
doing service for others in the abstract game business.
After such sterling efforts, he has earned the right to be
thoroughly irascible and super-touchy, identifying his
games with himself to such a degree that he regards
any complaint about the former as an attack on the latter.
No-one likes to see their baby told it has crossed eyes!

So no more complaining about Christian Freeling for me,
even if he consistently fails to live up to his....  first name.

Nothing I could possibly say could embarrass him more
than Stark's horrible cocksucking.

But I guess when you're both stark AND mere, the options
for intelligent subtlety are severely limited...
