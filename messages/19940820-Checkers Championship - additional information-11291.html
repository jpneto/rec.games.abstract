I would like to provide some more details about the checkers match
status.  Several posters are jumping to conclusions without knowing 
the facts.  It is very distressing to me and my team that we have to
waste time responding to stupid accusations that are ill-founded
and without basis.  Right now, we have other things on our mind.


TINSLEY'S HEALTH
Contrary to what people might infer, Tinsley's health problem is
long term and has nothing to do with any stress related to playing
Chinook.  I have not been told the specifics of what is wrong with
him, but it is related to a medical problem he had in the 1950s.
Tinsley is in good spirits and not in any pain.

PLAYING CONDITIONS
A rather persistent poster seems to believe that Tinsley is playing
under adverse conditions that are favourable to the machine.  In a previous
post, I mentioned some of the things we have done to make this match as
pleasant as possible for Marion.  Here, I would like to add one more data
point.  Tinsley played in the US Open 2 weeks ago - 32 games in 6 days
(an average of 5.3 games a day).  Normal World Championship matches are 40
games in 11 days (average of 3.6 games a day).  This match is 30 games in
11 days (2.7 games a day).  Tinsley is delighted with the playing conditions
and schedule.   In 1992, Tinsley said the conditions were the best he had
ever played in, and that for the first time in his life he was being
treated as a World Champion.  The 1994 playing conditions are better than
in 1992 and he has said so.
A poster says that Tinsley is doing us a large favour by agreeing to
play us.  In part this is true, however we are doing Tinsley a larger favour
by agreeing to play him.  Tinsley <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>wants<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to play us because there are
no more challenges left for him with human opposition.  He relishes the
chance to play us.  He loves the publicity he receives (he was thrilled to see
his picture on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, a paper he reads
daily).  He thinks this match is good for the game and hopes that it can be
used to further popularize it.  As well, he is getting money for playing,
more than he has ever received for playing checkers before.

WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
Resigning the match and declaring Chinook World Champion was done by
Tinsley without consulting us.  According to the rules, this is the correct
procedure and it has been endorsed by the ACF and BDF.  We <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>DO NOT<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> want
this title under these conditions.  To be "world champion" while Tinsley is
still alive and undefeated is ridiculous.  Nevertheless, whether we like it or
not, we have the title and must keep it at least until the end of next week
(the Lafferty match).

LAFFERTY MATCH
We did not want to play this match, but out of respect to the sponsors,
organizers and venue, we agreed.  I do not see anything wrong with this.
After all, these people have gone to a lot of time, trouble and money to
make this match possible.  It would be irresponsible of me to not follow
through with what they feel is best.
I would also like to state that we were ready to pack our bags and leave.
It was Tinsley's idea to have the Lafferty match.
Chinook 1994 is considerably stronger than all its predecessors.  So far
this year, we have played almost 140 serious games against strong op-
position without losing a game.  In this run, we have defeated all the
best players in the world... except Tinsley and Lafferty.  Tinsley and
Lafferty are the only 2 humans with more than 1 win to their credit against
Chinook.  We came to play Tinsley but, since this is not possible, play-
ing Lafferty at least allows us to try and demonstrate that we deserve to
be #1 or #2 in the world.

CHINOOK TEAM
We are devastated by what has happened.  Tinsley is a personal friend of mine
and we are very concerned for him.  By staying and playing Lafferty, we are
doing what he wants us to do.

FUTURE
We have no interest in the World Championship title.  We are only interested
in a scientific data point: is it possible to build a checker-playing
entity that is better than all humans.  Until we play Tinsley, we will not 
know.  Our sincere hope is that his medical problem is not serious and that
he will be able to play us in the near future.  We have offered to play
him whenever he feels up to it.
