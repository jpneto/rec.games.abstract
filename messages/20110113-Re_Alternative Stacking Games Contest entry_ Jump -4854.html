Timing.  When you release three games in short order, the third game is met
with resentment, sight unseen.  Like "Jeez haven't you punished us enough
already?"  If you release more than three games in short order, you're
villified.  You're like a pimp with a bevy of underage girls strung out on
heroin.

I will certainly read this soon.  I was busy all day redoing the Monkey
Queen rule sheet.  11 diagrams changed from 8x8 to 6x6, a lot of work.  I
appreciate all the feedback thus far, but the design chapter for Monkey
Queen is now closed.  Moving on......

For the moment I'll leave them both as possible

valuable for the  final choice.

This is part of why I wanted to extend the contest to the whole winter. 
Sometimes you go to invent a game and you end up inventing a few.  Plus you
need time for post-feedback tweaking.

There should be a vote-down per inventor.  So first everyone decides which
of each inventor's games they like the most and then vote on those games,
one game per inventor.
