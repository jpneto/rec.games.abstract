Steven, the revised version of Forms seems like a very elegant and
intriguing game, but, since I haven't played it, I can't really
comment much. It's the kind of game in which any a priori assumptions
are most likely false. Of course, this only means that Forms is a
highly original game, which is good.

I would like to know more about how it feels in actual play, namely
what the ratio {game length / board size} is and if it's strategical
enough despite the dramatic changes in the board position on each
turn.

Also, since you have designed Anchor and Orbit, both elegant and
finite territory games in the Go spirit, I'm curious to know your
opinion of my latest game, Loose, which shares all those features.

Thanks for your kind words about Forms.  I welcome negative feedback
as well as positive feedback, but the positive variety is certainly
nice :)  There are unfortunately very few of us interested in abstract
games which do not already have a mass following.  I think that's why
sometimes we feel like we are releasing games into the void.

I've been playing Forms games by private email with a couple of
people.  Mostly we've played 6x6 games; the length has been averaging
10 to 12 moves per player, I'd say.  The board can change very
suddenly, but such a change must be first set up (unless there's a
blunder, of course).  So the game is not so volatile that it lacks a
strategic element.  However Bill Taylor has observed that Forms'
strategy seems to be of the rule-of-thumb variety rather than the
deeper-thinking variety.  He may well have a point.  He and I are
currently experimenting with Forms variants, poking and prodding.
Nothing exciting thus far, but we haven't been at it long.

The game Loose is indeed a variant of Go, but it's original in its
definition of a false liberty --- a defintion which is crucial to the
mechanics.  I agree with Nate that the distinction between true and
false liberties quickly becomes intuitive, which is a good thing.  I
played through your sample game.  There are some moves (e.g 42 and 43,
63 and 64) which seem essentially to be the same move --- there is the
actual placement and then there's the consequence of that placement.
The only move/moves that confuse me are 72 and 73; I'm not sure what
is happening there.

Also one question about the rules.  You state that "at the end of the
turn, every group on board must have at least one true libery."   I
think you mean that this includes the stone that was just placed?  If
this is so, it seems to follow that one true liberty grants
unconditional life.  If it's not what you mean, then it seems to
follow that two true liberties are required.
