I think it's Ralf Gering, but I could be mistaken.  My memory isn't
the greatest.

I just seems silly to me that he can call me weak, but I can't call
him a dick for that.  Imho calling someone weak is more of a deep cut
than the latter. Needless to say, hitting someone and running away
behind a locked door is pretty cheap as well.

I had a similar situation like this when I was 9.  I was playing
nintendo (original... wow I'm old) at a friends house and we were
supposed to be playing together taking turns.  He took an extra turn
and I said, "hey that's not fair we're taking turns".  Well, it was
his house and he didn't like taking turns I guess so he told me to go
home.  We were 9 so it made sense ^_^.

I rather expected it to be moderated since it's a moderated forum, but
I didn't expect to be banned after the first 10 words I ever posted on
the forum lol.
