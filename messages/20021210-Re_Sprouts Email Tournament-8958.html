This seems to be caused by mixing paradigms.  The way I learned
sprouts was "draw a line between existing sprouts (or a loop
back to the same), add a new sprout on that line".  Clearly this
matches the "take two away and add one" description.

The rules on the site are equivalent, but look at it in a
different way.  In that case, you add a new sprout (add three), 
and then you add two lines from it (remove four).  

I also had to think about this in order to verify that the site 
was correct.

PS This makes me wonder if anyone has examined the game of 
"add a sprout, then two lines (not necessarily from the new sprout)".
