Here are some mins/maxes from a few thousand simulations of random
play on a square grid:
size 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14
min  1  4  4  4  6  7  8  9 10 11 13 14 16 17
max  1  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 17 19 21 23 24 26
Greedy algorithms might be able to improve those bounds.

Thus the minimum for size 6 can be lowered
to 6.  I wrote a Prolog program to solve
such puzzles, and it finds the solution
above in about 10 minutes.  I'm making
some tweaks to how it intializes the
board for speed, because you have to
search in some fashion the entire space
to confirm no smaller solution exists.

Nice! I did notice such N-fits-into-N+1-with-no-room-for-more
situations in smaller sizes, but by hand it was too much to look
at the many various 5's.

I can't say I know enough about prolog to know how it would cope
with bigger board sizes. I presume that it scales roughly as
scarily as the N-queens problem.

Hi, Phil:

I confirmed the minimum solutions for 7x7 and 8x8
boards both required 8 marked cells.  The program
finds solutions quickly, but exhaustively checking
nonexistence of 7 cell solutions takes 35 minutes
for the 7x7 board and 7 1/2 hours for the 8x8 board.

There's more efficiency I should implement, avoiding
checking symmetric configurations more than once.  I
place the "first mark" in roughly one-eighth of the
board, which exploits symmetry partially (as rotating
and reflecting the board can always thus position one
of the marked cells).  Fully exploiting the symmetry
of a square board is a topic that I remember kicking
around with someone (probably for N-queens) in another
forum.  Having a little absent-mindedness in recalling
details...

regards, chip
