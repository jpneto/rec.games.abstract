hmmm.  That would be a sphere, but you have now turned the "squares"
in the top row into triangle-like things that meet at a point (call
this point the north pole).  How do you decide what happens when a
piece (say a bishop) goes over the pole?

I think that this spherical board (or ones isomorphic to it) is the
only one in which these properties hold:
  1. each square shares one edge each with four other squares.
  2. moving one square "left" then one square "down" takes you the
     same place as moving one square "down" then one square "left"
     (and so on for other paths-that-should-go-the-same-place).

PS.  I think that Nomic is a fun game, but I have to agree with
others who think that playing it by <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>posting<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to rec.games.abstract
is a very bad idea.  If each individual netNomic game had its own
newsgroup, then maybe.  (Or I guess one newsgroup for <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> games
of netNomic would be ok, as long as noone expected me to play :-)
