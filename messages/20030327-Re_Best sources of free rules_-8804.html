A good source of rules for abstract games is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.zillions-of-games.com">www.zillions-of-games.com</a>.

if you don't have the software, the web pages list the rules for literally
hundreds of  abstract games, some traditional and some original.

Ah, no, the rules to most of those games are NOT listed on the website
itself. There is room there for only a brief description of each game.
If you download the zipfile, it will usually contain a text or html
document which explains the rules in detail. But sometimes the rules
are embedded inside the Zillions help menu for that game, which means
you have to look at the source code file, which has the extension .zrf

I disagree.  While it is true sometimes it just involves a vague description, I
find that most of the time the rules are included on the game's web page.  Most
abstract strategy games are simple enough to describe in a few paragraphs.  I
know a couple of people who don't own the software but still use the website as
a source of game rules, so there are people who do this.

Virtually all of those games were just made up by the author of that
script, and are not for sale anywhere as a physical set. So, there's a
lot of chaff to sift through, to find games that are really worth
pursuing. It helps to have the Zillions engine, to get a feel for the
basic tactics.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This presumes that the only worthwhile games are the ones that are being
published.  In fact, a lot of the best abstract games have never been published
or had only a limited publishing run.  Abstract strategy games that have a
continous publishing run are very much the exception and not the rule.  That
this website carries games that can not be found anywhere is precisely what
makes it so appealing.  Granted there is a mix of both good and bad games, but
that's what you'll find with any extensive compilation.
