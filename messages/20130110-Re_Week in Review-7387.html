Corey, how many years has it been since you first started trying to oust me from r.g.a.?  If you weren't such a retard, a couple of things probably would have dawned on you by now.

1. I don't care how popular I am here.
2. I'm not leaving r.g.a. until I die of old age.
3. If you come to r.g.a., you're going to get goofed on by me.
4. The more retarded you act, the more you'll get goofed on, which is why I've targeted you for relentless goofing for the foreseeable future and until further notice.

Any questions?
