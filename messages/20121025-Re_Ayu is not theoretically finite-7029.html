Exactly.  When I first designed Oust, there was only a square version.  Then when I found out there was exactly one draw position, a board filled with a checkerboard pattern of black and white stones which can only be achieved via player cooperation, I changed it to a hex board and removed the square board version from my website.  A year later I uploaded the square version again because it had already been programmed and people were complaining.
