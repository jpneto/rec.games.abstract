In [Deutsch's] paper, the convenience of thinking that all

a matter of fact, Richard Feynman, in his talk during the First
Conference on the Physics of Computation held at MIT in 1981,
observed that it appears to be impossible to simulate a general

That is largely because the only thing Feynman knew about computers
or computations was main frame computers.  But since most of today's
computations depend on massively parellel networks, not mainframes,
his observation mostly concern 1950s Burroughs history, not
computers.

No.  Combining two classical computers together makes a computer twice
as big that can do (roughly) twice as much work in a given time.
Connecting two quantum computers would make a computer twice as big
that can do (roughly) the square of the amount of work in a given time.

Networking classical computers together gives you at best linear
growth; adding qubits to your quantum computer gives exponential
growth.

   Networking classical computers gives you microcomputers,
laserdisks,
   satellites,, HDTV,  Holograms, fiber optics, robots, and a
paycheck,

invented.

So, while parallel computation will let you efficiently simulate
bigger quantum computers than Feynman might have imagined would be
practical, the infeasibility of the general problem isn't impacted by
advances in parallelization or networking of classical computers.
And, if Moore's Law were to hold for quantum computers, too (doubling
of the number of qubits in a system every N years), the power of
quantum computers would run away so quickly that you'd never catch up.
