What this means is that the opening and endgame books will meet up,

Some facts you might want to know:

1. You are talking directly over e-mail to the guy that is doing
   the "solving checkers" stuff, and the world is listening.
2. The Chinook team has made a great effort in coming closer to
   solving checkers. The search (seems to be a minimum of 19 full
   plies now), and the size of the endgame databases means that they
   were one the way of solving checkers a while ago. When Robert
   Lake ha finished his work, there you have it. If he says he is
   half way, then let's trust him: he is half way.
3. The older Chinook results were so encouraging that many described
   checkers as "solved", "almost solved", etc. It isn't yet, and
   Robert Lake is probably the one in the world that knows best about
   the progress...

Sorry to respond/attack two of your postings on one day, but this
latter one was really silly. Quoting memories of some chess column
you read in the face of the guy doing the work that chess column was
about make you seem like a blithering idiot at best. I don't think
you are, but you may want to read and think, and check your facts a
bit more thoroughly before posting.
