Of course, you omit an even more fundamental possibility -- suppose
the first thing the players do is to vote that the game can no longer
be decided by voting?

 2. Design and lay out some meta-rules, which are unchangeable by any
    vote.

In the first game, I chose option two. I designed a set of 3 rules
which kept the voting process from being changed without an override
by me. Thus, only the fundamental essence of the game is immutable.

In a way this is cheating: I presume the voting was democratically by
simple majority? And why shouldn't that be changable?
Take the way the Americans choose their president in a trapped
system: is this a way of voting you want to exclude by imposing
some permanent Rules?
 
No Rule should ever be 100% fixed. At least, not from the start.

Of course, it is just as easy to choose option 1, and let the players
do whatever they like. That's what will happen this time, I think.

If you don't have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> initial Rules, why should things be done by
voting? If you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>assume<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> that decisions should be taken by a vote,
then again you are imposing a sort of higher Rule from the start.
 
I think you can not get away by making some sort of Minimal Initial
Ruleset (MIR, excuse me from punning), but it should be 100% flexible
and changeable.
