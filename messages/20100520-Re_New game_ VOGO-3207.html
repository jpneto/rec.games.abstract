One possible problem with Vogo is that small boards might not allow

Or even large boards with overly defensive play.  An abstract game
should never depend on "sound play" to function.  The two most
defensive players in the world should be forced to fight it out,
however reluctantly.

It's an interesting concept and yes, most interesting concepts end up
not working out as a game.

My advice?  Don't try to patch up Vogo.  A good idea that doesn't work
isn't really a good idea.  It's impossible to salvage it anyway
without totally complicating it, missing the point in a different
direction.  Rather than wasting time on an idea that you already know
doesn't work, just start over with a clean slate.  Infinity minus Vogo
is still infinity.
