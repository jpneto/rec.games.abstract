Yes.  That was the idea back in 1998, back in the dark days after
Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue.  I had the notion that it would be an
interesting challenge to devise a game that was simpler than chess
(not a hard criterion to satisfy) yet more resistant to computer
analysis.

You had not heard of go?

&lt;this is not a judgement on octi, i haven't tried it yet, but fully
intend to&gt;

Hi, Moah.  Your reaction was shared by a lot of others, judging from
the email I received off-line after my post.  I neglected to mention
go (even though I've been playing it for 25 years), and you're quite
right to say that it is computer resistant and utilizes very simple,
elegant rules.

My thinking at the time was that go achieves a lot of its computer
resistance through the sheer enormity of the board's dimensions; go on
a small grid is not necessarily resistant to computer analysis, just
as checkers on a 20x20 board is a lot more resistant to AI.  So I
tried to develop a resistant game without resorting to large boards or
large numbers of pieces.  Octi has just 7 pieces per side, which is a
fairly small number.  The 9x9 grid is spacious but doesn't overdo it.

(I also have a taste for games with moving pieces.  That taste is
neither here nor there from your standpoint, I realize; but at any
rate, it led me in a non-go direction.)

Anyone interested in trying Octi can visit <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a> and click on
"play Octi-x" -- this link hooks one to a robot and also allows person
vs. person play.  Or drop me an email, and we can get a game together
on PBeM.

Cheers,
Don
