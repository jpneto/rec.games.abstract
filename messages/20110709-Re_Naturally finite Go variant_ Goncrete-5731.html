This is a case of hard finitude versus soft finitude, to borrow two or
your terms. Of course, Go is already soft-finite, so opening the door
to cycles, no matter how unlikely they may be, would have defeated the
very purpose of my game.

But it's more than that. In Go, sensible play never leads to filling
your own eyes, but, in Goncrete, sensible play (I mean, without
cooperation between the players) can well lead to a full board
capture, especially in 9x9 games between differently skilled players,
where the weaker player may be unable to create a single alive group.

Yes, reflecting on it I can see that I tended too much towards the
idea that the removal mechanism provided a 'life insurance'.

Oh, there's also a minor issue I have just noticed: in Sygo rules, I
think you forgot to mention explicitly that non-capturing suicidal
placements are illegal. You do mention it in the examples, but not in
the formal rules, where you only talk about illegal post-capture
suicides, so to speak.

Thanks, I considered the "and therewith illegal" sufficient to cover
non-capturing suicide moves too, but I'll make the rule more explicit.
