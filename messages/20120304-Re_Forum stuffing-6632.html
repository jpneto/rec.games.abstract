Listen Topzag, you're obviously new here but anyone who says Go and
Chess are the best abstract games shouldn't be posting in RGA. Go, I
can handle, its got a decent level of depth and a simple rule set. But
Chess? Chess is a fucking joke!!!!!! The fact that people still even
play Chess and call it "the thinking man's game" is a perfect
demonstration of people's ignorance of abstract games. At least every
year we get new movies, music, books, even though the most popular
examples of those are more often than not (especially when it comes to
music) arguably less technically adequate than others.  But Chess is a
stubborn bastard, even though the science of abstract game design has
developed far greater games, a game from the dark ages still has the
nerve to purport itself to be "the thinking man's game." when its
hardly even relevant to the abstract game elite. Just as the top music
charts are inundated with singles from useless no-talents like Lady
Gaga, Katy Perry, Usher, Justin Bieber, or whoever the fuck else I do
not think the popularity of games like Chess and Go in any way
supports their inherent superiority over little known print and play
games produced by Mark Steere or Luis Bolanos Mures or Nick Bentley or
myself. In fact I think this statement holds especially true in the
case of abstract games which  I believe can be qualified more or less
objectively based on criteria like balance, draw rate, depth. As I've
said elsewhere even clarity can be measured objectively based on the
volatility of how the advantage shifts or how many moves seem viable
on any given turn. And I don't want to hear about how the most
competitive games aren't necessarily the best ones. Also Tic Tac Toe
is by far the most popular abstract game in existence, that hardly
makes it a good game. And finally I'll say not all popular abstracts
are bad, Amazons is brilliant, as is Dots and Boxes but the popularity
of those games doesn't make them good or bad, their level of balance,
depth and clarity of play are what make them good abstracts.

I'm not sure this is intended to be humorous or not, but it did make me chuckle :)

I'm fairly sure I didn't make any claim that Chess was good, just that it was popular, which is a statement of fact. It felt implied in the post that I was responding to that popularity in some way correlates with quality - the purpose of my post was rather to highlight that that isn't a logical conclusion.

Likewise, balance, draw rate and depth aren't necessarily objective either, as at the end of the day, each comes down to a subjective priority judgement of their importance. I personally feel that balance is essential, and my objective criteria for that would be that the game isn't fun if two experts always know that one colour will win. Draw rate and depth are harder to argue. It's fairly easy to subjectively argue that in a perfect game, perfect play equates to a draw. This doesn't in itself lead to a high draw rate, but it does mean that a draw would need to be a viable conclusion to a game.. Go is a game where I actually feel that a draw should be viable, so I've never liked fractional komi.

Depth is not only hard to argue, but also hard to quantify. Is depth best measured in move-tree depth, breath, or total nodes (forgive me for using AI terminology, it's the one I'm most familiar with). How do you quantify depth where the nature of the evaluation itself changes (such as redstone, where the red stones in affect distort the playing board itself)?

Nick made a post that I thought was particularly good regarding the importance of accessibility. Again, that's a subjective judgement, but if I was to put some of my design ideas on paper to share, I'd like to think people would play it - the more accessible it is, the more likely I am to get participants.

Also, there's the likeability factor. If no-one in the world had ever played an abstract board game, and suddenly played a single game of each one ever written, which would feel most compelling, and why? Does "best game" come down to one with theoretical depth and balance, or one that both beginners and experts alike can play competitively with a fair chance of winning and find fundamentally fun?

Just because the design of games requires a lot of attention to detail on probability and other branches of mathematics doesn't mean that philosophy and sociology (I'm serious on that one, the number of players and the environment of play, such as Settlers of Catan encouraging odd temporary mini-alliances) don't have a large impact on the subjective quality of a game.

In reality, adjectives like zero-sum, solved, balanced, deep can always be quantified objectively, albeit with subjective or comparative thresholds. "Best" and "Good" will always be subjective by definition, which hugely increases the scope in how to achieve them in a given game design.
