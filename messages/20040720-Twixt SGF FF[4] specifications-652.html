SGF FF[4] is a convention for text files which are records of
abstract games. The protocol allows an entire tree of branching
moves to be stored in the text file, not just a single line of
moves.

A spec for Twixt games which conforms to FF[4] has now been
posted at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/twixt.html">http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/twixt.html</a>

This is a little different from the move syntax which exists
on Richards PBM server. Most moves are simply indicated by
the hole where the peg is placed. Any links are automatically
added. That much is the same. But Richard's server does not
record whether sides were swapped or not (although it allows
swap to be played.) Also, the PBMserv syntax serves a different
purpose; people type in the move they make when they send in
their email.

FF[4] is more likely to be used by software which will generate
or read a text file of a game or games, so the syntax was chosen to be
a little easier for software to deal with. It is still quite
readable by people, however.

Actually, the best software that currently manages a Twixt game
database is Jtwixt, which cannot as yet import FF[4] files. But
hopefully that will change.
