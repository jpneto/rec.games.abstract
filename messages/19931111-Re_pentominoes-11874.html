In "Imperial Earth", Arthur C. Clarke mentions, in fact devotes extensive
time to, a game he calls "Pentominoes".
Essentially there are 12 ways of putting together 5 identical
squares such that they all touch at least one edge to another square, there
is no overlapping, and they remain in the same plane. Out of these 12 shapes
many other shapes can be made. According to Clarke (remembering that the
book was written in 1976 and that he describes a very brute force algorithm
)  it would take 6 million, million years at a rate of 1 per second to run
through all possible combos.

I'm wondering if anyone has done any computer stuff relating to this, or
in general has seen any discussion about it.

yes, a good deal of it in fact. Clarke picked it up from Martin Gardner's old
Scientific American columns - many of which are available (in libraries at
least) in book form. Basically there have been many people doing many things
with pentominoes, but I don't have any references with me. Look for the
Gardner stuff.
