Christian Freeling "further clarifies":
"Growing 'every group' had to merge with the rule that no group may grow more than one stone in a turn.  The former had to be subjected to the latter, so growing at group 'A' made that the vacancies it shared with group 'B' would be off limits, and vice versa.  Hence the order of placement would determine whether or not a particular group was subjected to growth..."

Oh <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>now<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> I understand  (?)  Good thing this is all so "symple".  

Incredibly, Christian is now blaming me for the incomprehensibility of his game:
"Since [Mark Steere] is determined not to understand anything about Symple.... here are the rules at Sensei."

Hoboy.  Here we go again...
