I played two times at Kahuna (edited by Kosmos). It seems for me that
you have to be a lucky guy to win and that it's hard to define a tactic...

You have to avoid some mistakes (like having none connected islands) but
seems to be hard to really have an impact of you opponent game.

After playing, I count the cards... there are two cards per islands
(even islands who have more bridges thant the others). Letting me think
that it's really a matter of luck.

I may be wrong (I read that it's a tactic game).

Could someone who knows better than I this game, explain me if there are
  tactics for Kahuna ? and how to minimize the matter of random in the
game. Many Thanks.

sorry for my english, I'm french ;-)

There are two basic strategies.  I've found that these aare all or 
nothing tactics, you have to decide at the start of the game which 
tactic you are going to follow and then pursue it single mindedly.  
The two strategies are Raid &amp; Defense.

Raid consists of playing bridges everywhere with the focus on taking 
a particular island at some point in the future.  The key is to 
place brdiges in places that your opponent cannot remove, between 
two islands he already controls is the classic position.  With this 
strategy you will almost certainly lose the first round but you should 
be positioned to "snap back" and sweep several islands back into your 
control for the second round by starting to hold onto cards and then 
play groups of cards to break your opponent's hold on his islands.  
In some ways this is floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee.  
Your opponent won't be able to make a concentrated attack on you beacuse 
you don't 'own' any territory.  You have to keep your pace relentless 
and never let your opponent settle.  Two players playing Raid can be a 
confusing experiance for an observer with ownership of the board
completely 
changing every couple of turns.

Defense consists of slowly and methodically building territory, 
only playing carsd when it guarantees you an island, getting to 
the stage where you can hold pick up and hold onto cards that you 
then never play denying them to your opponent.  Start with one 
island then sieze the neighbouring islands, slowly spreading out 
and smothering the island.  If both you and your opponent play 
Defense then Kahuna can be a very slow and boring game.

I'd say that a good Raid player would beat a good Defense player 
given equal luck <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>but<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> playing and effective Raid straegy is 
harder and requires more thought than playing Defense.  Incidently 
In every gaem of Kahuna I've played the winner has always controlled 
Elai at the end of the game.
