Event: Bishop Games Two Player Tournament
Date: May 31, 2008
Location: UK Game Expo, Birmingham (UK)

This is the first Hybrid Athlon (mix of abstract strategy and non-
abstract strategy games) event to appear on the IAGO World Tour
schedule. It will be a 5 game event, three of which are straight up
abstract strategy games (Hive, Gipf, and Quinamid).  There is also
Lost Cities (2 player card game), and Fjords, which is a Euro game
with abstract strategy game overtones. It will be taking place in U.K
in late May.

I know that abstract strategy game purists might be a bit upset that
Lost Cities would end up in an IAGO World Tour event.  But, one of the
purposes of the Tour is to promote abstract strategy games.  By
highlighting multigame tournaments that are at least 50% abstract
strategy games, this is a beneficial way to draw attention to abstract
strategy games.  The words "Hybrid Athlon" are used to denote these
mixed tournaments.  Tournaments with just abstract strategy games are
Athlons.

Thank you for your time...
