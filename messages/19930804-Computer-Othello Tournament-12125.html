                   THE 1st PADERBORN COMPUTER-OTHELLO TOURNAMENT

                                October 5-7, 1993
                               Paderborn,  Germany



The 1st Paderborn Computer-Othello tournament will take place at the 
University of Paderborn, Germany, from October 5th, 9:30am to October 7th, 1993.

We will provide Sun-Sparcstations (Sun-OS 4.1, X11R5) - so, if your
program is portable you don't have to bring your own hardware. Furthermore, 
some people have promised to act as operators for those participants
(especially from overseas) which are not able to come to Paderborn. In this case, 
we will also provide 486-50MHz PCs with at least 4MB of RAM and VGA graphics card.
Please note: first come, first served. Apart from that, any hardware is allowed as
long as the operator is able to carry it.

The entry fee is DM 70,- to be paid at the registration desk at October 5th 
or via postal mail, in cash, by traveller's check or Eurocheque. Accomodation is 
available at a price of some DM 70,- (bed and breakfast).

The format of the tournament and the timetable will be announced when the exact 
number of entries is known.

Entries should be send to
