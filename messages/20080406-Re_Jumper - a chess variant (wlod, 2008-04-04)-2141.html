You think so? In a separate post I proposed
the very general idea of asymmetric chess
(special cases were known and played for years),
and in particular I have suggested that white
may have queen, whle black has jumper (or vice
versa). Do you think that jumper would have
an advantage?

I will need to hunt down your post.  My feel for your piece is that it
seems to feel a bit overpowered, even if both players have it.  It
looks like the game becomes more of one where players hunt the
jumper.  Maybe I am off.  Do you know how to use Zillions?  Maybe you
can have Zillions uses it.

I was thinking about a weaker version of
jumper, where diagonally it would move like
a bishop 9without the ability of leaping
over pieces) but finally I decided on
simplicity of the rules. Even vertically
and horizontally one could demand that no
piece, which stands on the same color square
obstructs the jumper. Thus we have three
possibilities: jumper (call it super jumper),
vh-jumper (lepsa horizontally and vertically but
diagonally it acts like a bishop) and
weak jumper (it leaps only over the pieces
which stand on the other color squares).

After rereading what you wrote, it seems less powerful than I
thought.  I was thinking of the movie "Jumpers" when I read your post,
so I thought your piece went anywhere.  Anyhow, perhaps having it do a
jumping diagonal movement, but allowing queen like capture would be a
possibility that would work.  The question is why you want to use the
piece though, for what purpose.  I know mixing it up is cool, but
besides that.

I feel that the super jumper is the most interesting.

So, in other words, it is an experimental piece you would play with?
I would recommend having one baseline version of chess you use and
then plug the pieces in there to see how they go.  I would personally
recommend adding drops and gating to regular chess to get the piece
in, but that is your choice.  Then experiment.  The best thing to do
is run it in Zillions and watch the AI play.  This is because, unless
you have a bunch of willing test subjects, it is going to be hard to
find anyone to do it with.
