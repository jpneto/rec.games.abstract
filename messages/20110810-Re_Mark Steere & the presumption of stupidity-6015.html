The accusations are mounting.  Here I hate gay people because I have a
sense of humor.  In the Arimaa forum I'm being accused of something I
don't even understand, based on my "response" to a conversation
Christian Freeling had with himself, which I also didn't understand.  

Mike, I hate to lose you but I need my sense of humor.  You need one
too.  If it's a choice between my humor and my one fan...   adios.

My sense of humor is quite healthy and well known when dealing with
folk not dominated by bitterness, so you can spare me the
condescension.  Your newest attempt to twist this into your "sense of
humor" being misunderstood after you previously twisted events to
imply that I was gay, and denied that you were vulgar and insulting
(last I checked, "fuck" is vulgar and "stupid" is insulting, no matter
that you would wish it otherwise), is another example of why I no
longer feel I can hold an honest conversation with you.  You proclaim
your blunt honesty to the world, but there is little honesty in the
manipulative nature of your arguments.  My opinions of your games,
good, bad, and indifferent, are not affected, just my desire to
discuss anything with you.  So you don't really lose a fan per se:
just his personal respect.
