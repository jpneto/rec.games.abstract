This was discussed on here.  The title of the film (as of now) is Pawn
Sacrifice.  Here is IMDB info on it:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345/</a>

Tobey Maguire is pegged to play Fischer at this point.  My hope is
that the film does notable box office and generates an increased
interest in chess.

Also from the site:

Ever since his film career started to take off after Seven (since
Alien 3 didn't really do it) David Fincher has attached himself to a
number of movie projects throughout his career. Indeed, some have said
that just having Fincher attached to a movie likely means that he
won't make it. For instance, in the mid 1990s Fincher had been
attached to make a movie from Torso, based on the graphic novel by
Brian Michael Bendis. No, you didn't miss the release of Torso -- it
still hasn't been made yet.

A movie based on Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama has also been
forever stuck in Fincher development hell along with another graphic
novel adaptation, Black Hole. So when news breaks that David Fincher
is attached to yet another movie in development, at this point I've
learned to not get my expectations too high. I'll save that for »
