This community does not remotely thrive, Graham. And it isn't even all
Mark Steere's fault (though it is for a large part). Christian and
Mark were only fans of each other as long as they felt they mutually
benefited from the ego-boo, and recently the community has gone
overboard with plagiarism accusations against Nestor Romeral Andres -
one of the few people from this community who has gone on to create
something of lasting value, namely a print-on-demand publishing model
for small abstracts.

Hi Harald,

This community may not thrive, it's not dead either.

I've never been 'a fan of Mark Steere'. I am interested in his
approach to game inventing not in his approach to inventors or other
interested parties. I have no issues with Mark, other than that we
seem to have different rules of discussion, and that this fact
interferes rather deplorably with any prospects of a positive result.

My contribution in 'going overboard' was the recognition that Omega
was identical to a game Bill Taylor and Nick Bentley made. I also said
Nestor was in it for the money, but not only for the money. When Nick
questioned the amount, I replied:

"I couldn't tell, the site looks professional enough and the games
selection shows a certain love for abstracts. At the same time it's
rather toyish and Kris Burm-like: make sure to use material that
buyers wouldn't have lying around. It's all right with me, but Omega
keeps me wondering ... surely Bill Taylor would have noticed it is
his
game? "

And that was the end of it. I don't consider that 'going overboard'.
As for the 'clash of egos', please provide examples where I made
outrageous claims other that those <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>made into<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> outrageous claims by
Mark who, as you rightly noticed, expects anything to become true for
everyone by frequent repetition, because that's how it works for
him. ;-)

In other words, forget that I wasn't interested in your services,
contacts, advise, whatever, and leave me out of your rants. And giving
unsolicited warnings against Mark ... do you really think it's
necessary to 'protect' people?
