Hi!

I recently visited China and purchased a game that I am curious to
find more information about.  I was hoping to email a picture, but I
am using Google and it does not have that feature.

The game contains 25 rectangular pieces each of which contain two
Chinese characters.  There are three sets of three pieces, five sets
of two pieces and three single pieces.  I am not sure what the
characters on the pieces stand for.

It's a game similar to Stratego (published by Avalon Hill).

The pieces consists of
1 flag (you lose the game when it is captured)
military officials of different ranks (higher rank captures lower rank)
bombs (moves like officials and kills anything on it's way but
destroys itself also)
land mines (doesn't move)

Each player takes turn, moving one unit each time until one side captures
the opponent's flag (hidden in one of the camps in the back.

I don't have a working copy with me so I cannot provide you with rules.
I hope someone on the net does.
