If you really want to advertise this tournament on a newsgroup,
try rec.games.board
rec.games.abstract has very little traffic.

Not only is there no mention of this tournament on your website,
Out of all the board game contests you list, only one is for
2 players: Starship Catan. Not abstract.

Do you expect abstract games enthusiasts to travel to Michigan,
only to be told what game(s) they must play?

There is a way for two players to choose what game they will play.
The process of choosing what game, itself becomes a game.
Both players have access to a table of N*N games, for example:

     A            B             C
------------------------------------------|
            |             |               |
  Checkers  |    Go       |   Universe    | 1
            |             |               |
------------------------------------------|
            |             |               |
    Twixt   |   Ploy      |   Othello     | 2
            |             |               |
------------------------------------------|
            |             |               |
  Gomoku    |   Hex       |   Chess       |
            |             |               |
------------------------------------------|

One player chooses A, B, or C. The other player simultaneously
chooses 1,2, or 3. The result determines what game is played.

If a list of abstract games is provided on your website, players
could at least see what they're getting into.

There's also the issue of where will these board games come from.
Some are public domain, such as Hex and Renju, and it's "easy" to
generate cheap boards and tokens. But that's time and
effort for the director. The usual solution is to ask the players
to bring their own sets. Is that what you're going to do? Ask
players to bring their own? And somehow keep players from
playing the games they bring?

Howdy everyone! I'm planning to host a small (up to 16 participants) abstract
games tournament at the U-Con gaming convention to be held in Ann Arbor,
Michigan on November 16-18, 2001. The tournament itself will take place
Saturday from 3pm until 7pm EST, and the entry fee is US$3. Here's a copy of
the text from the program:

Participants will compete in a series of 2-player abstract games. "Abstract"
means no random elements and no hidden information (e.g. Checkers). To
emphasize original thinking over prior study, participants won't know which
games they will be playing beforehand. Clocks optional (BYO). Tournament
structure and prizes will depend upon participation.

Registration and more information can be found at the U-Con web site:

I hope to meet some of you there. If it goes well, maybe this will become an
annual event at U-Con.
