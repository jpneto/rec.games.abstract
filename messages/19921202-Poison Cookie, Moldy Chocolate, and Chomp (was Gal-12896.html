It is a special case of Poison Cookie where, if I remember rightly,

I have never heard of this Poison Cookie before.  Is it published?

At first I thought you were talking about Moldy Chocolate (as in Ian
Watson's _Another_Fine_Math_You've_Got_Me_Into..._) in which players
alternate taking half-planes away from the rectangular grid of
chocolate, trying to avoid taking the moldy piece.  This turns out to
be quite an easy game once you penetrate its disguise.  Watson
describes Moldy Chocolate only with the simplifying assumption that
the moldy piece is at the corner of the rectangular field, which makes
the game so simple that you might not see the disguise.

I've only seen Chomp described with the poison square at the corner
and the bites taken out from the opposite direction.  This saves us
from having to deal with cases like

in which the poison becomes separated from the rest of the game.  Of
course Poison Cookie could be at least this strange, depending on what
is allowed and what isn't.  Though from the description of
``rectangular bites'' it's not clear you can make these moves all at
once, or whether you are required to take intact rectangles, as in
                       _______

At least in the 1st printing of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>W_W<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, this is the only form of Chomp
described.  That's unfortunate, because it doesn't lend itself to the
infinite analogue, in which you start with an infinite quarter-plane
of chocolate (an especially attractive game to those of us who like to
imagine an infinite quarter-plane of chocolate).  It does, however,
lead immediately to the higher-dimensional analogues, in which the
number N may have three or more prime divisors.
