One question, though: Doesn't
the move in figure 6c violate the limitation that you can't hide one of
your own checkers when moving backwards?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, because there's no such limitation.  The very reason I included
Figure 6c was to emphasize that fact.

O.K.  I misinterpreted the "things you must not do simultaniously" as
any two of the three.

The rule that you can't cover all opponent pieces also makes
analysis more complex.

Thank you.  I really like that rule.  It incorporates itself
effortlessly into play and it buys you inestimably vast expanses of
game tree.  Normally I would never include a non-essential rule like
that in a game, but this time around it was all about the tree.

I can't really see how it would increase the size of the game tree.  You
disallow some moves and positions, so as far as I can see, this will
only decrease the size of the game tree.  But it does make the game
harder to analyse (when you don't do a full game tree search), as you
need to weigh the advantage of covering opponent pieces with the risk of
being forced to cover all of them.
