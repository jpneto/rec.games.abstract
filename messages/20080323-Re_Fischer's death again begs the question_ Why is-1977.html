Please justify your assertion that awarding less than half a point for
a draw is mathematically more sound.

I suppose it is not pure mathematics, but empirically the half point
draw has produced a situation where contestants routinely
avoid playing real games. Imagine, for example, we awarded a
draw the value of 0.9. What do you predict that change would
make to the game, and would it improve the game? Same
arguments apply to 0.5.

That's a fair question. I would also like to add to it the list of questions 
I posed David Richerby in the immediately preceeding post - not as a 
challenge to David, but to try to initially establish <i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>where<span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> the draw 
problem is.

I suspect that we only address the top 1% of players, that historically 
there were fewer draws among them, and there is also likely to be a gender 
differential.
