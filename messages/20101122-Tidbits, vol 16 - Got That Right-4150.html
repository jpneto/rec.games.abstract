Corey, once one of your games touch #1 on BGG's
abstract rating, or is ever studied in-depth
by a player of Michael Reitz' calibre, then you
may laugh.

Corey Clark responded:

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
whoops, sorry, I forgot that Yinsh was part of the
Gipf series. Sorry for forming an opinion of my own
there. I mean Dave Dyer came in here effectively
highjacking Nick Bentley's topic about his new game
to proclaim his infatuation with the Gipf series,
-"Gipf I love you and imma treat you right this time
baby."- as if this wasn't made clear enough on his
website, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.burmspace.net">www.burmspace.net</a>.

Got that right.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Then the sheer absurdity of the statement itself
has to be analyzed. Comparing the two games, Yinsh
takes Othello a territory game with a global strategy
and turns it into an n-in-a-row game, a family of
games which are notorious for being purely tactical.
And your reasoning is even more absurd! If Yinsh is
popular, Othello is at least 10 times more popular.
I have yet to find Yinsh in somebody's household.
