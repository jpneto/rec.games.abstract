Now I'm anticipating a 12x12.  I don't think I'll take it to 14x14 because
it becomes difficult to visualize straight line paths at that size. 
Otherwise I'd consider it.  Same number of checkers initially: 20 of each
color.

What's driving the larger sizes?  In a word, robustness.  I want to minimize
first move advantage to the greatest extent possible.  There seems to be an
initial fill in phase in Monkey Queen in which both players try to create as
many babies as they can.  Eventually someone's queen becomes immobilized,
and that player is forced to move a baby, unable to create a new one.

Among the best first moves for White (Player 1) are squares near the center
of the board.  Center moves make it more likely that the black queen will be
immobilized first, forcing Black to move one of his babies instead of
creating one, and putting White even further ahead in the baby count
(already a .5 checker lead).  There are altogether more babies on a 12x12
board by the time a queen gets frozen, rendering the deficit of one baby not
so devastating.

The worst first move for White seems to be moving directly forward one
square.  The question is, "Is this move so bad that it creates a
disadvantage for White?"  If so, then the pie rule should serve to balance
the game.  If not then every possible first move is advantageous to White. 
One way to minimize first move advantage in the latter case would be to
increase the board size to the maximum reasonable size at which players can
be expected to visualize straight line paths - 12x12.  This would make the
pie rule more effective.

The larger board may create disadvantageous moves for White, even if none
exist for the 10x10.  Or there might not be any disadvantageous first moves
for White on the 12x12.  But the least advantageous first moves on a 12x12
will be considerably less advantageous than the least advantageous first
moves on a 10x10.

Example of a 12x12 game of Monkey Queen ending in checkmate on move 54:
