Are there games played with hexiamonds (one or more sets) on the market?
The 'Triangel Team', a one person and his family company, will make
several two and more person games for two sets of hexiamonds. They
will be cuts from wood. The game will be presented at the fair:

    I've heard that the game fair in Essen is the biggest of its kind in the
world. I've been to the American Toy Fair in New York City, but one doesn't
get to play many games there.
    I really love polyform puzzles myself. If you like, I can give the address
of the World Game Review, which devotes a lot of space to that subject. 
    I have a neat problem for you using heptiamonds. Make a model of each hep-
tiamond which is 5 times the size of the original. Since you will actually
need 25 heptiamonds for each figure, and there are only 24 of them, you should
use two copies of the heptiamond which is being enlarged. Or, to put it another
way, make a hole in the figure of the same shape as the figure itself.
    I am currently exploring a set of polyhexes, of orders 1-5. I've also 
played with hexominoes, pentacubes and tetratans. A mail-order company called
Kadon Enterprises, which has been mentioned here before, makes all of these 
sets, plus some others. The 2D sets are done in acrylic, and the 3D in wood.
    E-mail me if you need more info, but soon, please (my account may expire
in about ten days).
