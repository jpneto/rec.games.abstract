|&gt; In theory, the Placer is at some disadvantage, simply because it is harder
|&gt; to establish an equal position than it is to find a preference for one side
|&gt; over the other (in the same way that it is harder for the cake cutter to
|&gt; make two equal halves than it is for the chooser to pick the larger one).
|&gt; This imbalance is magnified in some games because the extra move for the
|&gt; first player may be invariably advantageous, regardless of the position.

Well, I can't think of a single game where this applies! Please let us know,
if you can. Surely it's always possible to find two "almost useless" moves to
go against one pretty good one. (This merely shows that the 2-move 1st-mover
can be made to be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>worse off<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> than the 2nd-mover; it doesn't show that they can
be made to be about even. That <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>could<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be impossible in some game that had
very "coarse-grained" moves. But again, I can't think of one.  Anyone?)

|&gt; For Go-moku, it may be more reasonable to use two or four moves to find a
|&gt; position with equal chances.

No, don't think so. Three moves seems fine to me. Of course for infinite-board
go-moku, 2-move equalization can't possibly work, as I said earlier. But for
a finite board it could, and even 1-move equalization might work; an opening
move very near the edge could be sufficiently poor as to give equality.

|&gt; In practice, the Placer may have a significant <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>advantage<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, because she
|&gt; is able to set a position which favours her style, from either side.  For
|&gt; example, a very sharp, double-edged position with equal chances would
|&gt; favour a tactical player over her more methodical opponent.

Absolutely! An excellent point which I hadn't given full consideration to.
Leonid Gluhovsky made the same point in his very interesting followup.

it allows the Placer such an enormous choice of
three-move sequences that he can prepare a sequence that leads to a
very complicated position that the Placer had analyzed beforehand and
the Chooser sees for the first time in his life.

This could indeed be a problem at (say) checkers and (especially) chess.
Rather less so though, I would say, at go and go-moku. Still, it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>is<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a
problem - it brings in "off-the-board" considerations such as:-  who has the
best spy system for detecting what the opponent's favorite openings are?  or:-
what is he working on right now?  These problems are already with us in chess,
especially; but they would become worse with 3-move-equalization.  Too bad.

|&gt; The claim that this equalization method reduces opening preparation is
|&gt; also questionable.  The Placer will soon develop certain "pet" openings

Also true.  Good point.

|&gt; Also note that for games which can end in a draw, equalization may
|&gt; actually be undesirable.  

Interesting point, but games with too many draws are a problem in their own
right, regardless. And one which may be insoluble; (checkers is already almost
untenable because of this).  You seem to agree with this, as you say...

|&gt; For chess players, I will once again point out that the number of drawn
|&gt; games can be reduced simply by abolishing the illogical stalemate rule.

Heavens yes!  I've been grouching about this for years.  So has everyone
else with a bit of game-theoretic sense, of course.  But have you ever tried
talking to a chess expert aboput this?  Cripes; talk about wild-eyed paranoia!
You'll get the most amazing spiel of nonsense arguments about it. It's the same
in any game, seemingly; the expert doesn't want his pet cabbage patch messed up!
Try telling a bridge expert how silly it is to have majors and minors scoring
differently!  Or a backgammon expert how the can't-play-both-dice rule is
slightly screwed up.  Even in go, there is entrenchment over Japabese rules,
as opposed to the far simpler &amp; more preferable Chinese rules; (though at go
it doesn't matter so much for play, as the result is almost always the same;
but it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>does<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have a big, and detrimental, effect on new recruitment!)

Anyway, yes, stalemate should be a loss for the player who can't move. This
is more in keeping with the spirit of the game (i.e. zugwang), and would
noticeably reduce the draw rate.  Both big gains.

Don't talk to your club expert about it though!  You'll have spittle on your
lapels within a few minutes!
