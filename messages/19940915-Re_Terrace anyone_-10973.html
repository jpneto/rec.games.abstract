I recently saw this game in a store, and was tempted to by it, but at
$30.00 I'd appreciate any opinions on how good the game is before

	The last time I played Terrace was a couple of years ago when the
suggested setup was a double row of bubbles (domes?) for each side. I played
with another fellow who was also new to the game and it took us about 5 hours
to get through it. Since the bubbles creep along so slowly, it takes a long
time to get anything done, even when you work out some plan. Apparently this
was a problem for others, since the suggested setup is now one row each. I
am also curious about how well this works.
