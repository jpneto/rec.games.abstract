Gert's suggestion of the two stone move merely highlighted the original
complaint.  It takes a lot of lonely, non-interactive play to march babies
across a too big board.  Solution: Don't use a too big board.

There's another problem with the two-squares jump. In january 1982 my
son Demian was recovering from the mumps and I asked him to design a
chess variant (he had played several variants including Xiangqi). In
the course of an hour or so he dreamed up Congo.

His original idea was a set of 8-square jumpers, and the first piece
that he had made next to the Zebra (knight) was the Giraffe, a two-
square jumper, like Gert's babies.
When I asked him whether the Giraffe could reach an adjacent square
from any given position, in any number of moves, he went into deep
thought. Not for long though, and that's how the Giraffe got its
additional non-capturing king's move :)
