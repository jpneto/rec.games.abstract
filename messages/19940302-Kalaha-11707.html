And the results of Kalah with one, two, and three stones have been
known for some time. I think they were presented in Slagle and Dixon,
"Artificial Intelligence", 1969, or something like that. I wrote a
small program to perform full searches. Here are the results, (the
program written in C and run on a SPARC 2):

1 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 2 stones.
The best move (from 0 to 5) is 5.
A total of 2546 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 14 ply.
The search took 0 seconds.


Solving 2 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 6 stones.
The best move (from 0 to 5) is 4.
A total of 1421452 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 49 ply.
The search took 13 seconds.


Solving 3 stone Kalah

The beginner wins with 2 stones.
The best move (from 0 to 5) is 4.
A total of 273277910 nodes were searched.
The deepest variation was 96 ply.
The search took 43900 seconds.

Four stone Kalah is very large, so the world is still waiting...
