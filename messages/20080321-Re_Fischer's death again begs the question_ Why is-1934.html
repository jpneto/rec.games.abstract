<br>To the organisers, no. Among the players there would be a grapevine.
<br>Two grandmasters chatting in a bar, discussing this and that. Rumours
<br>of who is untrustworthy (in these terms agreeing a draw is trustworthy,
<br>even if illegal, welshing is untrustworthy) with a mixture of first hand and 
second hand information. And anonymous postings on the Internet. And
<br>then there's simple statistical evidence as to who's not drawing and
<br>who is.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You seem to be confusing yourself. To be "trustworthy" in the
<br>hypothetical example requires you to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lose<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> intentionally at the
<br>right time - i.e. when the coin flip goes the wrong way.
<br>
<br>So when I break my promise, and the obviously drawn game
<br>actually ends in a draw, my opponent is going to have to
<br>start complaining that I didn't uphold my agreement
<br>to lose on purpose.
<br>
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>And as I quoted, there's evidence it happens in sumo. By your
<br>reasoning it's impossible - but it happens anyway.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>This is simply false. Where have I said that cheating is
<br>impossible? I've pointed out frequently that cheating
<br>is possible even with the existing scoring and rules.
<br>It's the false argument that changed scoring inherently
<br>creates greatly enhanced cheating possibilities which
<br>will lead to increased cheating which I've refuted.
