I'm having trouble reconciling this with your ostensible lack of

There's no lack of professional respect. I think you've made many
great games (some of them I don't even like to play). I just find the
things you post to online message boards could be outdone by a
mongoloid 4 yearold in terms of intelligence and overall integrity. So
it's a lack of personal respect of the sort which most people develop
for you, most tragically your own parents.  Nice weasel words though.
Oh and no one lacks more professional respect than you my friend!
Notice how nobody else goes out of their way to insult other
designer's games. Only you do that. You are the incarnation of "lack
of professional respect." Please just shut the fuck up! Lack of
professional respect indeed ROFL.
