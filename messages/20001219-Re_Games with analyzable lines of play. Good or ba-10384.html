Unfortunately what people having been quoting is the number of patterns.
To recognise patterns you need to check them. Several people here just
have not appreciated how <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>big<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the number of patterns is. Remember the
old story about the man who invented chess and the one grain of wheat
for the first square, two for the second, then four, eight and so on?
That's a very small number of grains of wheat compared to the number
of patterns. If you divided the number of chess games by this number
you'd hardly see any difference in practical terms.

OK in theory, like Nim, you could find a mathematical proof. But chess
is so irregular (seven kinds of pieces, special rules and so on) that
I don't see it happening. (I'm aware of much less irregular problems
that a mathematical solution to would be worth millions if not billions
plus great academic honours that are unsolved for example.) Nim is
really simple in that regard. Also as I understand it in the limited
piece databases that exist patterns are difficult or impossible to
find (anyone got a good reference about this?)
