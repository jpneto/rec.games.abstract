If you are not blessed by a bunch of ayatollahs then do not expect any useful comments.
The forum became a place where people have no other choice than applauding.
Making a comment is not GIFT!!!
Some comments are really dumb.
If we need to set up rules for something UNLIKELY to happen then 1000 of rules need to be set.
My game Kanibalno used 3 kind of tokens numbered from 1 to 3. I can use set of 18 for each player numbered from 1 to 18. 100`s of solutions are available to make an opening free of being locked up.
Random set up is just for beginners. 
Players with more experience can place their own tokens (adding placement phase etc..).
The game itself could be the basis for 100 games if we change some parameters.
Anyway I do not care about fixing the rules once for all.
That is not my purpose.
I let this job to the expert of variants mister Freeling. Ha ha ha
Where are you Mark Steere?
