You can go, "Oh that is just politics".  If Chess were functioning
correctly as a community at this point, do you think it would nearly
have the issues it has?

You haven't yet shown it <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>has<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> any issues, other than pointing at Usenet

You seem to think that Chess in the past was free of cheating, controversy

And let's take a look at Chess960.  When they did a tournament for it,

following if there wasn't something there that regular chess isn't
providing?

How much of a following?  Who?  What's the growth rate?  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Facts<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, not
