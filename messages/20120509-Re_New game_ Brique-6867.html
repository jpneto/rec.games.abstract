I'd rather see yet another connection game than yet another Sygo promotion.

Crossway eliminates the minimum number of formations to prevent draws on a square board.  Crossway is a maximum subset of the draw susceptible game with no move restrictions.  It can only go downhill after Crossway.

That is patently false Mark, the depth of a game does not vary as the
number of available moves on a given turn. Consider Hex which is the
quintessential hot game, you can never directly harm your own position
because the only move restriction is not to play on an already
occupied cell. However, its easy to trim down the number of available
moves mentally based on their potential to improve your position. I
have to wonder if you're not being purposely obtuse here just to
provoke something but a good portion of your own designs reflect an
appreciation for move restrictions and how they enhance depth. Based
on the fact that someone went out of their way to do an expose on the
unplayability of Crossway and then you presented a game played on a
full size Goban that lasted 25 moves as high tier play, I'm going to
say there's room for improvement in the genre of square-board
connection games. Not that I agree with Nihlus but its reasonable to
say a game which on average involves a greater number of turns than
Crossway is deeper than Crossway. Anyway I'm just a little confused
that you would even make such a bizzare claim as the above and this
isn't about Slither but rather the futility of adopting a non-
progressive attitude like "How could you improve on X? Don't even try
it.". Really this needn't turn into another pissing match, I just want
to say I support Luis in his endeavors to design his perfect square
board connection game. I already see Quentin giving Slither a run for
its money. But apart from that why should designers be discouraged
from designing simply because someone else set the bar high on their
project? I doubt Bruce Springsteen ever intended to rival the
emotional and technical brilliance of Beethoven, he just wanted to
write music and that's what the guy did. There is a personal
satisfaction one derives from designing a board game just as there is
in creating anything else and there is something to be said for that.


but in all seriousness...Luis! Enough square board connection games
already! but good luck with your next one anyway ;) .
