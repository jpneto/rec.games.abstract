$5.00	3 introductory Shogi books, written in Japanese

I'm asking $5.00 total to cover shipping and my time.  Send me email and
I'll confirm whether you're the first or not.

I read them when I was in junior high.  I was cleaning out my library and
realized that I won't be playing Shogi much in the future because of time,
so I'm sending to anyone who can make use of the Japanese books.  The books
are sort of old but are in good condition.

----------

I'll pay shipping because I hate computing shipping costs.  If you live near
the Philadelphia area, I can give you driving directions if you want.

I have other items for sale, though they're not directly relevant to this
newsgroup.  Skip the rest of this article if you don't want to see the rest.



----------

$10	AD&amp;D Players Handbook, AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide (revised edition)

These are the original AD&amp;D books with the original (classic?) covers.  They
are both in good condition though there are very small stains on the bottom
of the DMG.

----------

$25	AppleSeed, books #1 through #4

The AppleSeed books collect the individual comics that were written by
Masamune Shirow.  Each book has 180 to 210 pages.  List price for each range
from $12.95 to $13.95.  They are all in very good condition.  I'm pretty
compulsive about keeping graphic novels in pristine condition.

----------

$10.00	Watchmen, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons

Yes, this is the Watchmen book.  You probably know what this is.  List price
is $16.95.  It's in very good condition though I have my name written on one
of the pages.

----------

$5.00	The Unicorn, by Nancy Hathaway

This oversize book with lots of color pictures details the history of
the Unicorn in literature throughout the world.  It's in good condition.
List price is $14.95.

----------

$5.00	Napoleon at Bay Scenario Book

This is a booklet for Avalon Hill's Napoleon at Bay wargame.  The 27 page
booklet has extensive historical notes from Vincent Esposito's _Military
History of the Napoleonic Wars_ and even has a bibliography.  It's
in very good condition.

----------

$20.00	Laser Disc Newsletter, 28 issues (Sept '91 through Jan '94)
$66.00	The Perfect Vision, #1 (Winter 86/87) through #19 (Fall 93), except #4

I'd rather not sell individual copies.

As a reference, Laser Disc Newsletter used to sell the 1989 set (12 issues)
for $35.00.  I don't know what they charge for the more recent backissues.
The original cover prices are all $3.00 each.  They are all in very good
condition.

I might get the February '94 issue of Laser Disc Newsletter in a couple of
days.  If I do, I'll include that for free.

The Perfect Vision has a sale where you can pick 3 out of 5 specific issues
(1, 3, 5, 7, 13) for $11.  So I calculated $11 / 3 issues * 18 issues = $66.
The original cover prices range from $6.00 to $7.50 each.  They are
all in very good condition.
