In pondering the 36 card deck problem, I was looking into odds
generation and ran into this interesting concept.

One die would have a range (say 0-4) and the other one would have a
binary option (1,6).  The end result would be an even distribution of
numbers 1-10.

Which die would you use to have the range 0-4?  There are 5 different
outcomes, so you would need a d5, d10, d15, d20, etc. to make all come
up equally often.  Since physical d5s and d15's are hard to come by,
you really need a d10 or d20, in which case you have gained nothing.

One option would be to use a d6 for the 0-4 range and let one side be
"reroll", effectively turning the d6 into a d5 at the cost of a reroll
every sixth roll.
