Do I understand correctly that the smallest example of a difference
would be a group on say a1-a2-b1, where the diagonal move a1-b2 is
made? 'During' the move, b1 and a2 are disconnected - this was not
allowed and now it is?

That's right. This is one of the two patterns where it makes a
difference. The other one would be a group on, say, a1-b1-c1-a2-c2,
where the move b1b2 is now allowed. When you pick the stone, the group
is split in two pairs of stones, but it's joined again when you place
the stone on the destination point.

If so, that cold be argued as logical, and in any case it improves
clarity.

But was that the scope of the argument, or do I miss something?

That was it. I thought the former rule was conceptually simpler, but
it turned out not to be the case.
