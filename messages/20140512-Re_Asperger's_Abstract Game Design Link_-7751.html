No Asperger's here, but among my game-nut friends there are a couple, which translates to a high incidence because I don't have many game-playing friends.

I took an online test for Asperger's syndrome a while back and scored well into the "probably has it" range.  It seems like a way higher than normal percentage of us have it (or probably have it).



1. Ed Koch

2. Corey Clark

3. Christian Freeling.  Christian seems too socially well adjusted to have it, but I know very little about Asperger's, and of course I take Christian at his word.  

4. Me?

5. I think there was someone else; I forget now...
