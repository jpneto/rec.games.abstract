I made the proposal that three-move equalization might be a good method for
most games with a decided advantage to moving first. (Or even disadvantage).

That is: player A makes a move for black, a move for white, and a move for black;
~~~~~~~  then B decides whether to be black or white; then whoever is white
continues with move 4, and so on as normal.

The question was asked, why wouldn't a 2-move or even 1-move equalization do,
along the same lines.  No-one replied; but it should have been obvious from
the original context, namely 5-in-a-row (or go-moku).

In 5-in-a-row it is obviously no use to have 1 or 2-move equalization, it is
still just as if black had the usual starting advantage (or even greater). So
3-move is the smallest sensible type for these games. To see that 3-move does
"bracket" the advantage, note that (i) player A may elect to put all 3 moves
several miles apart, in which case B=white may play the 4th move near his own
stone and proceed as if he had started the game with an unopposed move; or
(ii) A may put all 3 stones in a standard-looking opening, in which case
it is just as if B=black had the usual advantage.

So, somewhere between (i) and (ii), there ought to be a break-even point at
which there is almost no advantage to black or white. (At least there should be
if the effects of different moves is "fine" enough.)  "A" should put the 2 black
stones reasonably far apart, but so there is still a trace of influence between
them. QUESTION (1) How far apart should this be ?
      QUESTION (2) How near should the single white stone be ?

Guesses ??

There are two standard games where 1-move equalization <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> be good enough
to equalize the advantage, CHESS and GO; (but sadly, it is difficult to get
experts at these games to talk about such things; especially chess, where they
can become quite hostile if any suggestion about changing the rules is made !)

CHESS: Is there a 1-move equalizer ?  Does  1:a3 , for instance, leave black and
white with equal chances ? Is anything worse ? What about 1:g4 or 1:Na3 ?

GO: Ditto ? 
Does  1: 2-2 leave equal chances ?  My guess is a slight advantage to white.
For   1: 3-2 , I would guess a slight advantage to black.

Opinions ?

Mind you, even for chess and go, 3-move equalization looks like the best number.
