And how many people are playing <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>your<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, Alex?  I know, I know.  When you program your big megasite that outshines iggc, Ludoteka, and all the others, people will flock to Exasott, Sideways Hex, and all your other "inventions", lol

You can drop the phones accent, Alex.  Your English is as good as any other French Canadian's.  No wonder you keep losing at poker.  Your bluffing ability is in the toilet along with your credibility. 

You're still not as much of a buffoon as Ralf "Do you know who I am?" Gering, but if you apply yourself, maybe you can catch up to him.  

Good luck with your megasite, lol
