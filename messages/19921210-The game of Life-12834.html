anybody out there know about the game of life?  it's sort of a computer
simulation thing.  i dont recall much of the specifics, and that's why i am
posting this.  it was something like a piece could stay alive if it was
adjacent to 2 or three other pieces, and there were rules for new pieces
being born.  if anybody out there knows the rules, i would appreciate it if
you could mail them to me.

i hope this post wasn't too vague.
