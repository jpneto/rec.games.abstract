Someone made a clear restatement of my rules (thanks to him and his perfect english)
I quote him :
So to restate the rules of the game:

The game is played between two players (Red and Blue) on a Hex board of a certain size.
Each player received a set of player-colored pieces: 3 male, 3 female, and sufficient offspring to fill the board.
Starting with Blue, players take turns placing one piece of their choice on the board.
Both players must eventually place all 6 of their male and female pieces.
When the board is full, the players score, first Red then Blue.
Each player scores by tracing 3 paths of adjacent pieces, each one connecting one of their male pieces to one of their female pieces, passing only through the player's own offspring pieces. None of the paths may have any overlap or self-intersections, but apart from that there is no restriction on how convoluted a path can be. The player's score is the number of offspring pieces passed through.
Whichever player has the higher score is the winner."
