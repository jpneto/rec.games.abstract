Sounds like a fun game, with a very strong family resemblance to GOPS.

Just one thing though - you don't say if it's allowable to bid 0;
and if it is, what happens if both bid 0 ?   And I presume that if one
player is out of money, the opponent just continues with 1 move per money
till his own is used up?     Anyway, 0-bids need a ruling - very important.


Possibly interesting variants:-
-----------------------------

1)  The losing bidder keeps his cash for that round.  This would be quite
a differently-strategied game, I suspect, but it's hard to say straight off
which version would be "deeper".

2)  The board is far longer than the piles of cash; so it can never finish
with a "knock-out", but only by running out of money and a win "on points"
(or a tie).   This variant would of course be identical to many games of
the standard form once a certain low-cash point had been reached; but it
would be interesting to see how it compared if you KNEW it must be on points.


Pity it isn't possible to play by email!
