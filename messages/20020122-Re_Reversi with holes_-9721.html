  How does this make the game different?  Who/Whom exactly determines

  capturing determines the orientation of the captured pieces then
  wouldn't he simply orientate <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> his pieces the same way?  I think
  you should make it clear that the player whose pieces were captured 
  is the one to determine orientation.  If White captures several Black
  pieces then the player playing as Black is the one to flip over his pieces
  and turn them to White <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> orientate them the way he wishes.  Am I
  correct???
