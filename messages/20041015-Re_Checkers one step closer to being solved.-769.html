I went to a games festival in Paris last June and talked to a representative
of the French checkers association about this checkers program. He had
never heard of it. When he found out it wasn't the French version of the
game he lost all interest since he thought the games were totally different
and he didn't know anything about this other game.

I know this comes up regularly, but I don't think it has for a while.

There's an 8/2/04 posting on the Chinook site ( 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/</a> ) that says they've solved one 
opening and it's a draw.  The opening is called the White Doctor: 10-14 
22-18 12-16.

A practical implication of this is that this opening should be removed 
from the three-move restriction tournament ballots, if in fact it's 
currently in them.  I don't know whether it is or not.

They expect to be solving the other openings more quickly now that this 
one has been solved.

Another interesting this is that the number of three-move restriction 
openings is smaller than the total number of openings because some 
openings are disallowed, so this makes the problem of solving checkers 
somewhat easier, at least under three-move restriction tournament rules.
