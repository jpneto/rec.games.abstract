For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such would
be futile.

I think Go is the closest thing you're looking for.  It's been almost five
years since I've started playing Go and I've met a number of people who are
strong that do not study "joseki" (fixed opening patterns in the corner(s)).
FYI, my strength in Go is 1-2 Dan, so I'm no weakling :).  There is so much
room for strategy in Go that a strong player who does not study
openings/lines of play can make up for it later in the game.

I could go on but I will end with this - Go Seigen, arguably the strongest
player of this century (and many think of all time) is currently 86 years
old.  He has been playing Go for 70 years and he still studies Go for 8
hours a day.  He states he is still learning things about Go as there is
alot he doesn't know/understand yet! (However, I've read a number of top
professional players say the same thing).  From my own experience, the
stronger I became at Go, the more I realized how much more there was to
learn - that's why I laugh (not in their face of course) at people who say
they've tried or played Go (usually a couple of times, as if that was
enough) and say it looks simple or don't understand how it can be so deep.

Sincerely,

Nathan
