I was talking to a Chinese guy through the game chat translator at
iggc (lovely feature, Arty - a long standing wish come true) and he
was gushing over Oust for like 20 minutes straight, calling it one of
the world's greatest games and the "American Go".

Conversation is difficult through the automated translator, but he
seemed to be calling upon me to design a game with ko, explaining that
ko represents much more than just preventing repeat moves, and that I
could design a most heavenly game if I would only embrace ko, or some
such.

In particular about ko, why would ko represent much more than just
preventing repeat positions?  Was that just my imagination running off
with a bad translation, or is there something to that?
