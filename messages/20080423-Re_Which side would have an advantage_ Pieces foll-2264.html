This should be very easy to check. All chess programs worth a penny
let you set up arbitrary positions, from your description, that would
be sufficient (when setting up a king on the second row, it naturally
won't be able to castle, and a pawn on the third row won't be able to
move to the fifth). Take a seriously strong program, make it play
without an opening book, and see which side wins more often.
