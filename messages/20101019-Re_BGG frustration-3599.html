Getting pretty frustrated with the nonsense over at BGG.  My list of
people I don't really want to argue with is growing, making it less
and less likely for me to post anything over there.

Hutnik,

Hutnik is the single stupidest person I've ever met, online or off.
He knows just enough to make him dangerous.  I used to cut him slack
because I thought his "heart was in the right place" but it isn't.
Every time Hutnik opens his mouth he brays ill on abstract games.

Never heard of him.

Gering,

Gering is a volcano of megalomania, paranoia, and narcissism.  He
chemically castrated himself at age 12 for fear the government would
use his seed to revive their master race secret project and not credit
Gering for rescuing humanity.

Clark,

Clark was just about the worst of the bunch but he's reined in his
rampant wiseassery, and he's a fan of my games, so now he's earned a
probationary status, at least with me.  Sorry about the bias there  :D

Korneliussen,

I gave Korneliussen/Vintermann the nickname vinterdoggy because for a
time he was compelled to post a wiseass response to my <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>every<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> post on
the Internet, no matter what - exactly like a yapping little doggy.
The doggy has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and he's on my
permanent shit list.

I had to abandon
chessvariants.org because of Duke, Trice, Gilman, Winther, etc.  I'm
afraid BGG will be next if things keep going the way they're going.

Why wait?  It's not like intellectuals are flocking to bgg.  Flock out
and let Mistress Octavia tend her herd of morons.
