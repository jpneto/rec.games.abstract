I am not an experienced othello player, but your statements seems
strange to me. Because it's hard to visualize future boards, all I can
do in othello is to try to read the sequence a couple of moves ahead,
and try to maximize the number of my own pieces. This makes my play of
othello very tactical. For me, the strategy element is just trying to
get edges and corners, and this kind of strategy is quite superficial.

If I have missed some fine strategies in othello, I'd like to hear about
them.

Through most of an Othello match, the players should try to
keep their <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>mobility<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> up, not their disc count. To achieve
this, they should in general seek to disturb the position
as little as possible. A strong French Othello player once
said that "Othello is the art of making quiet moves".
A quiet move is a term in Othello strategy which denotes a
move that flips only a few discs (possibly just one), all
interior.

Beginners tend to flip as many discs as they can on every
move. By doing so they quickly ruin their own mobility
completely, and when I have opponents of this type I often
beat them 64-0 with little effort. I just make sure they
don't take <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>all<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the discs, wait until they are forced to
give up a corner, and then I slowly build my way out of
that corner.

An example often used to convince beginners that maximizing
is a futile strategy is as follows:

   - o o o o o o -
   o o o o o o o o
   o o o o o o o o
   o o o x o o o o
   o o o o o o o o
   o o o o o o o o
   o o o o o o o o
   - o o o o o o -

"o" is leading 59-1, but "x" has all the remaining moves
and will win 40-24.

It is not always bad to take many discs on one move, even
in the opening. If it forces your opponent to flip exterior
discs afterwards it may well be correct.

But I'm not gonna write a long essay on strategy here.
There are plenty of web sites explaining these things
better that I can do...just look them up with google! ï¿½:-)
