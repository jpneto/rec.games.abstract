1) How does one properly pronounce "hnefatafl"? :-)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I forget where I got my information, but I pronounce it like this: The h
is not silent, the e is as in "bed," the a's are as in "father," the f's
are as in "stuff," the t and l are as in "table." Apparently each (or
most) of the modern Scandinavian languages would pronounce it somewhat
differently.

I, as a Danish speaker, would pronounce it as h'neh-fah-taff'l.

2) In the combinatorial games literature which I own or to which I
   have easy access, I recall no discussion of these games (henefatafl
   specifically, not general "tafl" games such as 9 Men's Morris, Fox and
   Geese, etc).  Does anyone know of any?

I wish I did. Part of the problem is that there is no agreement on what
the rules were. There is more of a consensus on hnefatafl than on, say,
ludus latrunculorum. There is actually quite a bit of similarity among
many proposed reconstructions of the rules, especially more recent ones,
and many of the rules sets do make the game enjoyable. But even rather
minor differences in the rules can make a big difference in stategy and
tactics. Since there is not a large enough group of people playing the
game according to the same rules, we do not have a body of experts
gradually building up practical knowledge of the game which could be
passed on to other talented people, and to a lesser extent to ordinary
mortals. A pity, because it looks like hnefatafl could be quite a good
game if we had some good strategic principles.

I haven't played Hnefatafl more than once or twice, but when I did, I
noticed some similarities with the old Avalon Hill wargame "Caesar at
Alesia": In both games one side has to bring the leader piece from the
middle of the board to the edge, and the other side has to capture the
leader.  Also, the "two-to-one surrounded" automatic victory rule from
"Caesar at Alesia" is very similar to the capture rule in Hnefatafl.

Doe anyone know if CaA was in any way inspired by Hnefatafl?
