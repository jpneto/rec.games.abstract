Hi,
	a while back there was some discussion about the game of Mah Jong. So
therefore for those who are interested I have posted my list of hands from my
book "101 Illustrated Mah Jong Hands". Unfortunately these do not have any
illustrations but all the info is there. Some re-formatting will be necessary.
If you have any questions/comments please email them to me as I will be unable
to keep track of the net due to the fact of upcoming exams!!!!
Have fun
	Dave Warner.

The list certainly need to be worked on.

1.  It is American Mah-jong, which is more Gin-Rummy than Mah-jong.
    Too many special (limit) hands which allows going out with
    other than "4 sets and a pair" pattern.  Also clumsy antique
    point-based scoring rules (most modern Asian rules are "doubles-
    based").  The numerous patterns do not have a strong consistency
    among themselves to be easily remembered.

2.  Almost all the patterns are "one suit"!  "Cleared suit"
    mah-jong is boring stuff!

16. CONFUSED GATES

A Pung of 1s in any one suit.                               
No Winds or Dragons. 
A Pung of 9s in a second suit.

Concealed (except last).
FISHING: 400 points.

This kind of patterns (Confused Gates) adds more burden to the
players than enhance the game.  It is IMO an exploitation of
the relationships between suits.

Wow.  How many "run" patterns do we want.
A "run" isn't that hard.  "Cleared suit" is hard.  Shouldn't
give "run" hands too much, and shouldn't be designating
hordes of "run" special hands.  Burdens the player's
memory without enhancing the game.

Also, too many "concealed hand" patterns reduces player
interaction in the game and makes it less fun and exciting.

I see.  It is the "cleared suit" game.  Yawn.

IMHO, if anyone is wondering why Mah-jong has not become as popular
a game in America as it is in Asia, I can flatly tell you that it
is because of the American "adaptation".  They totally changed the
concept of the game and make it play like a modified version of
Gin Rummy.  Also, the scoring rules are more complex than those
commonly used in Asia, and the game is less playable.

The list IMO consists mainly of infrequent "limit patterns" which
have little impact of the game, but each one must be remembered
by the players and does not add to the flavor of the game.

"Cleared suit" mah-jong is IMO never as fun as the original game.
