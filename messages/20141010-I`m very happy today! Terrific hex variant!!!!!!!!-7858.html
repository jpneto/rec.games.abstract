Hi,

I have invented the most fascinating variant of hex game.
So I feel very happy.
I tried it on 8*8 hex board.
I still do not know which board will be optimal.
Fisrt : it is playable game only if digitalized
Second : A new concept is used ( I will keep it secret until I finalized the rules)
Third : I combined this new concept with an existing mechanics. I will try to replace this very known mechanics by a new one.

The game is absolutely terrific! 
More than that the game will give to the players a way to build their own pieces (under some rules).
So no game will look like any other (it all depends on the creativity of each player.
The more the board is big the more it will offer high creativity to the players.

I see you later.
