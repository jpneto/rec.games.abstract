Interestingly; for those who, like me, believe the whole concept of
"check" in chess (and its miserable corollary, stalemate), is an
unnecessary and irritating historical accident, spoiling the "clean lines"
of the game, (which should just be played to the king is actually
captured); the above remarks provide a cause-damaging counterexample.

Of course, it is theoretically possible, albeit unlikely, to be
stalemated without the notion of check:

        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

(Place the black pieces however you like, except that a7 and h7 must be
vacant, and d6 and f6 must not contain a black knight.  It's clear that
such a position is reachable in normal play.)

Thus pedants would insist on a stalemate rule for completeness, although
it is safe to say that the exact details of that rule would have no
effect on practical play.
