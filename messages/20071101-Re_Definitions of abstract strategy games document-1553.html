Ok, there can be a different name for the tournament play that is more
descriptive, that someone else can come up with, if need be.  The
major issue of the document is whether or not the categories work as a
taxonomy system, more than the name.

They seem fair enough for a start point which the participants can
further refine or not as need be, though I still feel you have more
detail than needed.  Why does it need to tell you about multiple queue
NULL?  For just taxonomy you want ideally enough information, but no
more than that.

Let's look at the NULL again for a minute:
[Null attributes]
* Types:
- Void: Pieces into Null never return to game (eliminated).
- Single space: Has capacity of one. Prior pieces sent to equivalent
of Void (described above)
- Pool: Pieces can enter back into play into play in any order
- Queue: Pieces enter back into play into a sequence.
- Multiple Queue: Each player has his own queue.

The reason has to do with exactly how games would leave or enter the
game.  It is a minutia difference, but important for games where there
is queuing, and how pieces enter the board.

Ok, I figured maybe, but also was thinking you were trying to come up
with a more game related name, and you could of put Foo Piece/Title of
Chess-type-game and still don't see how it would work.  I ended up
looking at your factiousness and tried to see the deeper issue.  But
then again, I don't think you stuck a winkie at the end, so I wasn't
sure :-)
