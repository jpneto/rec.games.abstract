Do you ceaselessly monitor this place so I cannot formulate and
finalize my posts before you read them? Let's just use this rule of
thumb, if I take it down, it never happened. Anyway, your strong suit
certainly isn't being a valuable contributor to a community interested
in the exchange of ideas. If I didn't think you were on some quixotic
mission to rid the world of what you view as non-"robust" games, I'd
swear you were trying to drive absolutely everybody out of this site
just for the hell of it. Well, you still got your hand-puppet Michael
Howe to keep you warm in the winter months. I'm certainly not going
anywhere, I can hang around here and be just as big of a douche as you
and I will enjoy every minute of it.
