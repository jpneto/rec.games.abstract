Stackers is a game that is played with the pieces and board from a
standard 8x8 Checkers/Draughts game.

Setup is as for a normal Checkers game: The 12 white pieces are placed
one each on the 12 black squares closest to the white player and the 12
black pieces are placed on the 12 black squares closest to the black
player.  Players take turns moving until one player wins.

A move consists of one of these two possible ways of moving:

 1. If a square has a stack of pieces where the top piece is of the
    moving player's colour, the moving player can move any top section
    of this stack (including the whole stack or only the top piece) that
    has a piece of the moving player's colour at the bottom to any
    diagonally adjacent black square.  For example, if the stack has the
    following pieces (listed bottom to top) WBBWWB, the white player can
    move one, four or five pieces to an adjacent square.

 2. If a square at the opposite end of the moving player's own side has
    a piece of the moving player's colour on top, this can be moved out
    of the game.  Note that only one piece can be moved out in a single
    move.

The first player to move all of his pieces out of the game wins.

While it is possible for players to move back and forth with the same
pieces to create a draw, I don't see this happening since a single
player can not force a draw this way.
