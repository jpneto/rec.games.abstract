<br>&nbsp;sorry to be confusing.&nbsp; there are still only 2 players, one white and
<br>&nbsp;one black.&nbsp; the board may be colored red, blue and green.&nbsp; with black
<br>&nbsp;to play first, white may say "you have to play on blue".&nbsp; black plays on
<br>&nbsp;blue and then could also say to white "you have to play on blue".&nbsp; there
<br>&nbsp;would be no restriction on what color could be required other than there
<br>&nbsp;be a vacant hex of that color.
