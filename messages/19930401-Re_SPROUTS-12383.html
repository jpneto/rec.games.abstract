I first read about Sprouts in the Piers Anthony book <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Macroscope<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>.
According to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> (1), it was invented by M.S. Patterson and
J.H. Conway (who also invented "life").

For those who don't know, the rules of sprouts are:
1. Start with some number n of dots on a sheet of paper.
2. Players take turns. On your turn, draw a line from one dot
   to another dot (or the same dot) without intersecting any lines
   (including itself), and put a new dot in the middle of the line.
3. There can be at most 3 lines coming out of a dot.  Initially
   there are 3n places to put lines, and each new line eliminates
   2 and adds 1 new place.  So the game can last at most 3n-1 turns.
   Usually less because there might be a place that you can't get
   to without intersecting lines.
4. The first player who has no legal moves loses (or wins--that
   version is interesting too).  I forget which is Anthony's version.

<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> says a few things about strategies, but not much.  I
bet a computer player could beat most humans easily by doing a
brute-force search.  It would be fun to write an X program that could
play the game.

For reference, here are the outcomes of some initial positions with
optimal play.  The numbers are how many moves it takes to win the
game, N means the first player wins, and P means the second player
wins.  According to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Winning Ways<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, nobody knows who wins for any
n greater than 6.
