I declared that the goal of "chess" variants is to capture some DEFINED
pieces.

I believe that the standard definition of a chess variant requires a
single ROYAL piece, i.e. a piece that is not taken, but that the game
ends when it cannot avoid capture on the next move.

What you have really said is that chess and gipf (tournament) are both
games within the same family, as classified by endgame.  I don't think
Kurt would have a problem with this.

2nd: a logic approach based on ONE common feature of all games: I decided
to chose the goal (object) of the game. Every game has a goal, a way
to win or to lose.

Games can also have multiple goals.  Your system would seem to divide
games into several overlapping sets.  Not a problem, but I would rather
see you talk about families than variants.  To call one game a variant
of another seems quite insulting to the designer, unless it is quite
clear that the original game was the model for the newer one.

TTFN,
