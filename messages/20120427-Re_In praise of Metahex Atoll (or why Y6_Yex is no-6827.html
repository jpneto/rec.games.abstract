I think this is where the problems lies with Y6. The edge templates are huge, no they are simply enormous. This means that on medium sized boards the ratio of the playable area (not in range of templates) to the area covered by templates is very small or maybe zero. This leaves only a small margin of interesting decisions ("creativity"). Thus the area of the board is used very ineffectively. [...]
By the way I think that this is also the problem with Crossway. The edge templates are too big. Naturally the game is playable and would be even more so on 21x21 or 23x23 but the above arguments apply.

That was exactly my motivation to design Konobi, which can be seen as a Crossway variant. Edge templates are very small in Konobi, if not simply non-existent, depending on how you define them. Note, for instance, that even a stone one point away from the edge is not guaranteed to connect to it, as aren't two stones with an empty point in-between ("bridges", in hex terminology) or a knight's move away from each other. Orcoon works in a similar way in that respect.

I should also mention Corey Clark's Slither, a great example of a square board connection game with very tight tactics and also free of edge templates in the standard sense.

In these three games, even the most basic-looking connections require a more indirect approach than in hex-based games, which adds to their strategic depth, IMO.
