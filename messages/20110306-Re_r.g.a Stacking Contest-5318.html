Mark, i just want to know, when has CF ever said "my game won a
contest against these other games and thus is better" especially when
two games have little to nothing in common.  The only time i've read
him saying his games are better, is purely a comparison of the games,
never popular opinion, and only when two games are very closely
related (dameo with draughts, grand chess with chess and gothic
chess), so i guess i just don't see the concern.

You also said you enter the contest just because you enjoy making
games, and of course while that is the main reason most of the entries
are in, anyone who enters purely for this reason has no interest in
what happens after the submission, nor how good the game is.  Axiom B
exists because if it isn't a given for someone, then that person could
care less.

"The public is stupid, Alex.  Call it coincidence.  You yourself have
provided an outstanding example.  You literally told me that you
would
deduct points from Monkey Queen because it isn't really a stacking
game in
your view.  Never mind that the contest very specifically allows for
the
most generous interpretation of stacking.  You think I want your
ignorant
vote in the contest, Alex?  You think I want hoards of like-minded,
ignorant
masses voting on my game??  Guess again. "

if my reason is stupid, would you call chess with the added rule of
knights are placed on a stack of 100 checkers, and each time it moves,
it loses a checker, when it reaches 0 checkers it can't move any more
a stacking game?  i think the majority of us can agree that it isn't,
as the fact that there is a stack of peices under the knight has NO
importance to the game (ok, i don't know all the details, but at the
very least, it isn't relevant more than once every 5000 games), yes
the game in the loosest terms is a stacking game, but i think anyone
who sees that game in a stacking game contest would immediately think
cop out (even if chess never existed before then).  In this case, i'm
not sure even your panel of "experts" will agree with you that judging
should only be for quality of game, never for how on topic a game is.
And even if the experts do agree, then you might as well thrown out
the entire theme, as virtually any game could be made into a stacking
game (hex by allowing you to stack peices on top of your own [thus
passing in a game where no move is worse than passing], go by allowing
you to stack pieces on top of your own [thus worsening your position]
et cetera).
My arguement against monkey queen was the same as against checkers
with knights being able to move a max of 100 times each, that the game
could be played with infinate stacks with no gameplay change.  I am no
longer certain of that, but i still feel that you judging the
objection as a "example of stupidity to be expected from the general
public" just points out how pointless going to judges is, when an
expert dismisses an idea as the stupidity that is to be expected of
the RGA public, when i doubt even most other experts will agree.

And if your own conditions for what is a stupid reason to judge a game
and what is a smart reason and who's votes are important and who can't
be trusted to judge your game correctly by your own standard, then why
don't you just judge your own game and declair your own personal
winner, since your opinion of what is a stupid way to judge a game
will be very specific and you can't expect any person or persons to
completely agree with you.  I just wonder how a group of experts
(determined after entrees are in) are really going to decide once and
for all what is best any better than the public can, when your stated
fears that you will be downvoted and CF will be upvoted via public
vote indicates that you have an opinion on where they belong, and you
will prolly continue to believe in the order you've determined no
matter how the vote goes.

you stated many times before that you fear CF will say "Grabber is
better than MQ because it beat it in a contest," if that is the
purpose of the contest to you, are you going to do the same if the
results go in your favour, is that why you care so much about who wins
and what your chances are and what the contest says was the best game?

Anyways that's enough ranting for now so a quick summery since it was
rantish
Where has CF said game A is better than game B for the reason that the
public said so, or because it won a contest?

For any person who Axiom B is not true for, they don't care how good
their game is or it's result in the competition, and thus wouldn't
take the time to formally enter it at all.

Marks example of public stupidity to avoid is relevance to theme, id
est does the theme's implimentation into a game effect the game at
all?

Should any game invented such that there is no reason to include
stacking  [the game is the same with a minimum stack size of infinity
or a maximum stack size of 1] be considered on an even field with
games where stacking is completely relevant?

If other experts disagree with marks assertion of what is stupid about
the public, does that mean that he will boycot judges who don't agree
until he just gets 3 completely like minded judges?

If experts vary this much, are we really removing bias by reducing
sample size?

Why does mark care so much about who gets crowned (while saying " Why
does everything
have to be capitalized on?  We can't just have a contest for fun.")?

If a vote draws lots of attention, but the result are subject to an
amount bias, is that always worse than a contest no one cares about
even if completely unbiased?  Is determining the correct winner with
no one caring really worth burying potentially great games with
irrelevance [in theory, regardless if that actually happens or not]?

And finally a personal concern

As you said, there will be expert judges even though i put in hours of
my time to come up with an honest evaluation of each game, what what
constitutes expert?  Will expert players be invited?  Expert
designers?  Expert analysts?  Experts in the social science of having
fun?  If one of these groups gets left out, what does it say to those
people who get left out of the judging process [in addition to those
who made an effort with every game with much of that effort going to
waste]?
