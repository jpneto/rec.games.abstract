Your graphics were not very clear on my monitor, but there was an error in
an earlier posting regarding what constitutes a drawn position. The error
was later corrected. You can indeed link up in tight situations, as long as
there is no link which actually crosses the path of your intended link.

Here are the rules regarding peg and link placement as, I believe, the author
intended them: A move consists of the following 3 steps:

1. Place one peg in any vacant hole that is not part of your opponent's border
   rows. No one may play in the corner holes.
2. Remove any links of your color that you wish to remove. You would almost
   never actually want to do this, except in tight situations where you need
   the room.
3. Make any legal link or links of your color that you wish to make.

Inasmuch as many versions of the game have a different set of rules,
particularly regarding step 2, it would behoove you to make sure you and
your opponent are using the same set of rules before starting a game.

I'd also like to know how to capitalize TWixT, and why the heck tWIxT is
not capitalized like other games.

I don't know if Alex Randolph (the inventor) is responsible for this, but my
3M version calls it TwixT, perhaps to visually suggest two pegs on a board,
viewed from the side, with something betwixt the two pegs. In other words,
capitalizing this way visually suggests the game itself.
