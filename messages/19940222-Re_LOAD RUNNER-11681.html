Hi;

This is the first time I post on the group. I am looking for a game called
"load runner".
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think the spelling is 'Lode Runner', as in motherlode.  Excellent game!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I believe it is a very very old game (at lest as old as
APPLE IIe or IIc). Also has pc version.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There was also a version for the Mac, probably wouldn't run under system 7
though.  Lode Runner is the granddaddy of all arcade games.  Games like
'Lemmings' and 'Emerald Mines' are its descendants.

I asked most of peopel around. But they either gave me the wrong one or just
know nothing about it.  I tried to use Archie, but still fail.

It used to be distributed by Broderbund Software but I think that it has gone
off the market.

The game basically talking about a little figure collecting some colored
boxes(namly treasures), And serveral( normally 3) chasers are trying to catch
that little figure. That little man can dig holes to trap those chasers. ( some
time dose that in order to get some treasures embedded by wall).  This game has
totally 50+ episodes.

Not only that, but there was an editor that would allow you to create your own
puzzles, comprised of diggable/non-diggable surfaces, ladders, bags of money,
and Bunglings (the little chasers).  I saw some fantastic puzzles created by
using the editor, and the best ones would always have some sort of "trick",
involving either order or timing (or both), which would have to be solved in
the abstract (and then in real-time) before the screen could be completed.

The holes that you dug would heal after a few seconds.  If a Bungling fell
into a hole you had dug, he would be trapped there, as he struggled to free
himself.  When the hole healed itself over, the Bungling would reappear at the
top of the screen, reincarnated.

The runner was controlled with the i-j-k-l keys (for up, left, down, and right
respectively) while "dig to my left" and "dig to my right" were the u and o
keys.  Some dexterity was called for, but the primary fascination I had for
Lode Runner derived from the ingenuity of the puzzle screens.

That is all I remember. I miss that game so much. Please drop me a mail or post
if you know that game ( it most likely  has another name). or any clue about it

Good luck finding this game!  Please post the results of your search.  Hmmm,
maybe someone on comp.sys.mac.games knows something about finding copies.

Your attention will be  greatly appreciated.

And your attention will be completely absorbed by this addicting pastime, if
you find a copy.
