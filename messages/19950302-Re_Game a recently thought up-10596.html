Blockade, a similar but richer game appeared in 1979 from Lakeside Games.
The board is larger and each player has two pieces set well in from the
corners.  The object is move either piece to either opposing goal space,
while placing walls to block the opponent.   It must always be possible
to reach both opposing goal squares; the opponent may not build a wall
which makes it impossible to do so in either case.    There is a shareware
implementation of this called Confound available on various on-line
services and BBS's -- either a wall may be placed or a piece
moved on any turn -- alternation is NOT required.

Another wall-building game is Kage, invented by Jay Myers and published
by DMR Games in 1986.   This is very similar to Remy's game, but each
player starts near the center of an 8x8 board (edges don't wrap around).
I seem to remember hearing someone solved this game, but I don't know
any details.

kings, a supply of pennies, and half of a standard chess board (4x8).
The starting square was 1 diagonal step in from the corners. A move
consisted of moving the king (like a chess king), then placing a penny
anywhere. Squares with a penny could not be moved to by either side.
Last side to move wins. It's a fun game.

Lakeside published Isolation, a game extremely similar to this,  in 1978
(there was an earlier European version under a slightly different title).
Much more interesting is the turbocharged Game of the Amazons, invented
by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, and published in Spanish in El Acertijo
number 4 (1992).   My authorized English translation appeared in World
Game Review in 1994; a tournament by fax was played in 1994 between
an American team and an Argentine team (drawn 3-3); A similar USA-Italy
match by post is underway now.
