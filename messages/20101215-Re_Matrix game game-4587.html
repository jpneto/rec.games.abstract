games or for board games?

There used to be people posting games of the recreational math variety
such as yours, too (Leroy Quet and Torben Mogensen to name a couple),
but not so much any longer. Reading the previous couple of threads
should make it clear why - they're mostly monologues by the guy who
just acted like an ass to you.

I suggest boardgamegeek's abstract forums. They're not perfect, but
Mark's de-facto banned from there, which makes them infinitely better
than here. recre.games.combinatorial is OK too, but I won't rule that
some people would rather get legalistic on your game being non-
combinatorial, than discuss it. (Sadly, self-styled abstract game
designers often have personality issues. Mark's not the only one,
though he's exhibit no. 1)

I agree with all that has been written here.

To Mike: Your game is certainly a mathematical game, and it certainly 
fits in with the spirit of some of the games discussed by James H Conway 
or the Winning Ways series of books. In this respect the comments by 
Mark Steere are biased and incorrect, but not unexpected, as seems often 
to be the case with him. I suggest you also try to discuss the game in 
alt.math.recreational in addition to Harald's suggestion of 
boardgamegeek, which might give you a better reception than you 
unfortunately seem to have had on here. I do not believe the 
recreational maths group suffers from too many people with overly large 
opinions of themselves compared with what has been evident on this group 
recently from two quarters.
