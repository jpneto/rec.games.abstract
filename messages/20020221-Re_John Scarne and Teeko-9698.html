You can find some nice pictures of John Scarne and his game at

The last of these shows some other games on the table as well-- "Scarney"
and "Follow the Arrow".  Other than the fact that they were produced and/or
marketed by John Scarne Games, Inc., what is known about those two games?

As a side note, the picture shows Scarne's son, who was given the middle
name Teeko, after the game.  How'd you like to have Scrabble, Salta, Twixt,
or even Chinese Checkers as your middle name?  I guess Bridgit might not be
too bad, if your dad invented that game.  Othello, too, I suppose;  though
I'd hate to go through life knowing I was just a copy of something older,
with a minor variation.

Ralf also wrote, in response to someone's suggestion that game's popularity
might have simply been hype:

Didn't you see the picture showing all these movie stars playing Teeko
simultaneously against Scarne? If you don't know the names, try to find them
in filmographies. They were all celebrities.

Well, I don't know whether it was just hype or real popularity.  But the
fact that there are pictures of celebrities playing the game is not evidence
for real popularity.  That could have just been a typical publicity stunt,
requiring nothing more than cash to set it up.

One of them looks like Judy Holliday.  Another might be Walter Slezak, I
think.  I don't recognize any of the others.  But that's not saying much.

I <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>am<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> interested in knowing whether the popularity was real.  I wonder how
I can find out?  Other than Scarne's book, were there perhaps some newspaper
articles covering the tournament?  Perhaps the number of units sold, of the
book and of the game, compared to other comtemporary books and games would
give us a clue?
