	   I have heard that while some very good chess programs have been
   written for computers up to the Grandmaster level, no one has been able to 
   write a program that enables a computer to play at such a level. The
   implication being that checkers is far more difficult at the professional
   level than is chess. Has anyone else heard of this?

This information is incorrect. The Checkers World Championship match
was just held at the Computer Museum in Boston, between reigning world
champion Marion Tinsley and Chinook, a computer checker-playing
program from SGI. They played six drawn games, and then Tinsley was
forced to resign due to illness, so that the current checkers world
champion is a computer program, Chinook. Chinook has accepted a
challenge by Don Lafferty, current US champion, and Chinook-Lafferty
match, also for the world championship is going on right now. As of
Sunday, August 21, There have been 8 games played. The first 7 were
drawn, and the eighth was won by Lafferty. So while the odds at the
moment are in favor of the humans regaining the world championship,
Chinook has certainly proved that it can play checkers at the
professional level.
