I believe if a simple change makes a game a lot more richer
strategically, it should be considered.  I had toyed with the idea of
using a doubling cube, for example as an option for tournament play,
to add another meta-element to consider.  Some would argue that it
distracts from the purity of a game.  I would argue that the
introduction of a clock does similar, but has been shown on the
tournament level.

You are absolutely right: When chess clocks came into use, that
changed chess into another game, a game where time was an element.
That was a huge modification: suddenly, chess had another winning
condition besides checkmate! Yet it became accepted. The pie rule to
Hex was in fact a less radical change: It only introduced some new
strategical considerations at the beginning, but you still had to win
in the regular way. (I'm not saying people aren't playing Hex with a
clock, by the way)

Tournament play did cause a requirement for something that would be
done.  My issue with some of this here is that you get people argue
chess, AS IT IS NOW PLAYED, is pure, perfect and "handed down by the
gods" so we don't touch anything, even the idea of 1/2 point for
draws.

If your time shaving rule was used, people would have to learn to
evaluate various starting positions - but they more or less have to,
anyway. They would also have to adjust their playing style to the time
they have at disposition - but chess players are very used to that
already. In addition, Fisher Chess is, I think, mostly balanced in
practice, so there would be very little to gain. I'm guessing most  of
the time, players wouldn't bother offering a time handicap (except
perhaps to balance up the advantage of white?), and they would just
choose sides randomly, since that also balances the game in the long
run, no matter what tricks the "splitter" tries.

The attempt to appease some self-proclaimed "purists" on here, was
where this conversation started, but it lead to a valid issue to
analyze here.  I don't mind Chess960 being played the way it is now at
all.  Some complained here, so I thought what could be done.  But,
other issues about unknown and even known cases of uncertainty in game
balance (by the way, when game balance is fully known, they consider
it "solved") perhaps the idea of time shaving off the clock is the way
to balance any game, like unisided escape games (like Tablut).  It is
the fairest way to be able to balance, without messing with the game,
in my opinion now.  Experimenting with Chess960 and the clock could
end up building an experimental base by which to see how balanced
positions are.

I personally like to have, with Chess960, players having a chance to
play both sides, and/or use the time-slice pie-rule as extra levels of
play balance.  And, I do understand the concerns of self-proclaimed
purists and like to be able to have things as close as possible to the
idea, but there are the pragmatic considerations of having growth in
interest, and also what works on a practical level.  The self-
proclaimed purist does have a tendency to want to throw a hissy-fit
over things, and end up actually changing definitions of words to fit
their view of the world.  Such causes me dismay, but hey, each their
own.

Anyhow, for the purist, who would end up arguing that ONLY Standard
IAGO definition abstracts are real abstracts, I propose there be a
"Combinatorial Cup" series that is part of the IAGO World Tour.  This
series contains only games that would fit the "Standard" definition in
this document:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/game-acceptance">http://abstractgamers.org/wiki/game-acceptance</a>

I would ask others to comment on here, and see what else needs to be
added.  I know someone have whined, "There is no such thing as a
'standard abstract strategy game'.  There is either abstracts or
not".  Well, the term "standard abstract strategy" is for practical
purposes to offer a baseline.  It is an arbitrary decision to fit a
necessity.  It is ask people comment and see if they disagree, and if
you want abstracts in your mind to just be "standard" by all means do
that.  Practical consideration of running an organization for
abstracts requires to decide how much deviation is allowed from this
baseline and still be allowed in.  And I know self-proclaimed purists
get upset about it, but an equal number of people (even larger
numbers) would disagree with your very narrow definition, so a
compromise needs to be reached here, one they aren't happy with.  I
say also, if people can't overcome this, then I would say such people
are snobs, and need to take a chill pill here.  They are free to start
their own Combinatorial Game Preservation Society and sign up people
as members.  Shoot, go and do that.  Such a group is free to run their
own events, and I would be more than happy to have IAGO work with
them, if that is their thing.  I do have a feeling though some of
these self-proclaimed purists have no interest in doing anything of
the sort, but just want to whine and acted as spoiled dictators who
aren't goinbg to lift a finger to help, but will yell like a spoiled
child that things be different (and storm off when the world doesn't
exactly conform to their ideals).

What I will do is try to run the time-shaving pie-rule past people who
actually are involved with Chess960 and see what they think. If I get
the look that I am insane for suggesting this, then I have to
seriously wonder who has the problem here.

All told, I believe both players should play both sides in tournament
play for a given position personally.  This is just the easiest way to
do it. Oh, also throw in that ties should NOT be 1/2, 1/2 for both
sides.  One could use the time-shave pie-rule also to see who would
get the advantage of a draw.

Also, in the most recent Chess960 tournament they used speed Chess960
as the way to resolve the tie-breaker.
