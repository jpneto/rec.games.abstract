Sure it's important to the individual game, but back at our
Checkmate Championship we have Shogi with a pool of taken pieces to
re-enter play, and we have [Western] Chess which has a potential
pool from promotions, and I'm sure there are variants with all
sorts of other flavours including a void, and so on, and yet
they're all being played in the Checkmate Championship.  So my
question remains, why do we need to know all that in the basic
taxonomy document?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The taxonomy has other purposes.  For one thing, it is a way to
systematize things so that you get to see if there are any concepts in
abstracts not developed yet.  Secondarily, the discussion for this
document came out when trying to discuss exactly what games would be
under the banner of IAGO verses what wouldn't.  If not look at, even
with areas that aren't important, you then end up with a case where a
slippery slope develops, and IAGO ends up being a general table game
association, that now includes Scrabble, Third Reich, Settles and
Carcassone, because "gee, they all have some level of abstraction".
There has to be a line drawn somewhere, and better to start off as
detailed as possible and then simplifying then trying to go the other
way.

As for a Checkmate Champion and the other categories, a Checkmate
Champion (Royal Elimination) is next to Multipiece Elimination
(Checker games), so this detail prevents you from deciding, "Hey we
have two games that involve eliminating pieces, chess and checkers.
Let's have them lumped together in the same category".  Well, Chess
and Checkers, by the nature of one game focusing on Royal piece(s)
being eliminated, while the other one isn't, are different game types
by nature.  While the voids aren't relevant to that part, the
categorization of game types in general are.

Another categorization had to do with whether a game is commercial or
in the public domain, and whether or not it will fit within a standard
set of equipment.  Standardization is important here as it is the
compromise point between designers (who would want association members
to own every configuration under the sun), and players (who want to
own just enough and not more).  A lack of standardization, and
insurance that certain equipment is in the hands of enough players is
why the likes of Camelot isn't tried by many.  Few people have the
board configuration to try it.

For your tournament taxonomy you only want it if you're using it to
define the tournament parameters, or at least so I'd have thought.
  As well as e.g. Chartrang plus descendants, do you envisage a
tournament category of Null Multiple Queue games?  I'd have thought
it's an entirely secondary characteristic for your taxonomical
purposes?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There is minutia in there for academic reasons, and also for game
designer reason.  The idea of Queues in some aspect are used to handle
games that are stacking and Mancala games.  The reason to try to
handle the games this way are so that you don't break Mancala or Focus
off as unique category games.  When you start doing this, you end up
with a "World of Abstract" site's definition of Towers (stacks and
piles), Soldiers (single piece in a space) and Soldiers and Kings
(single piece plus a king piece) which doesn't work on a tournament
level.

There is eventually going to be a tournament taxonomy also, that isn't
going to include a lot of the main definitions doc.  This tournament
structure is off for awhile, until there can be agreement as to what
constitutes a real abstract strategy game, and what should be under
IAGO.  This disagreement has resulted in backgammon and kriegspiel
possibly being eliminated, or people wanting to drag Carcassonne in.

I'd be putting that sort of detail in small print in a second tier
document, rather than giving it to people to wade through at the off.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This document now is the "academic" version used to look at what is or
is not abstracts and for philosophical discussion.  The practical
version, which will fit under the standards rules for IAGO, will be a
different version completely and embedded in rules.
