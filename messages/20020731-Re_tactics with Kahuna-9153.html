Not true, if during the round you or your opponent uses the 2 Coco cards,
and the 2 Iffi cards, then you will know that if you take Kahu and only
leaves the two bridges to Coco and Iffi empty, then your opponent won't be
able to take Kahu from you (until after the discard pile have been shuffeled
again).

This would seem to be a rather spurious example. You're saying that if
both Coco cards have been played (none by your opponent between Coco
and Kahu) and both Iffi cards have been played (again, neither by your
opponent between Iffi and Kahu) that you are then safe to play three
(Kahu, Gola, Jojo or Lale) cards to take control of Kahu. Well, sure I
agree that it's a pretty safe bet that your opponent will not be able
to take control of Kahu. However, those are a lot of conditions and
you're not even assured of keeping it in any case. If I take control
of Coco, Gola, Jojo, Iffi or Lale you'll need to remove any bridges
there which may cause you to lose control of Kahu.

You don't even have to use the cards, just hold the cards on your hand, and
only use what's absolutely nessecary to take the island. If your opponent
then later removes one of your bridges, then you will be able to place the
card that you kept, and secure the island again. If you don't get to use the
card, then you will be sure that your opponent won't get it either.

Well, having several Coco and Iffi cards in your hand as well as at
least three of Kahu, Lale, Jojo and Gola cards is an excellent
guarantee of controlling Kahu. However, this is akin to the strategy
of "making sure your hand is of a higher rank than your opponent" in
Poker.
