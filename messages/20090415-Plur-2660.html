Plur:  Another untested idea.  Plur is short for Plurality.  Rules:

For two players, played with black and white stones on a hexagonal
tiling.  I don't know what the optimal board shape/size will be yet.

Player 1 owns the black stones and player 2 owns the white.

1.  Board begins empty.
2.  Starting with black, players take turns putting a stone onto any
empty space.
3.  Game ends when board is full.
4.  Whichever player owns the majority of the three largest connected
groups on the board wins.  If it's impossible to clearly identify the
three largest groups because two or more groups are tied for "third
largest group", then the player who has the majority of the 5 largest
groups wins, and so on.  If you go all the way down the line without a
tie-break, the game is a draw.

It may need a pie rule.  I don't know.
