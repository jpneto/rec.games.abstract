Wrong, Mike.  You've got Christian Freeling syndrome, directing insults at
yourself.  Here in California, it's quite common even for gay people to use
the expression "fucking gay", having absolutely nothing to do with
homosexuality.  I don't know how that got "arrived at", but that's where it
is.

I don't know about schoolchildren or how they fit into this discussion, but
maybe they're on the east coast, and west coast lingo hasn't filtered across
the country yet.

There's been discussion of what do I mean my architecture, and I've tried to
explain it - something you'd know if you'd been following it, instead of
pouncing on sound bytes.  Architecture is a vague notion that certainly has
a lot to do with subtlety, beauty, and fabulosity, though not homosexuality.
 No hyperbole intended.

Nor do I claim to have.

Totally misrepresenting what I said and attacking it is vulgar and

Mike, simmer down.  I think you got insulted when I commented on your
nickname, Fizzy.  My point was only that one would never deduce "Michael
Howe" from Fizzy.  Not that gay people are more likely to be fizzy, or any
other perceived insult.

Holy shit, Mark this has absolutely nothing to do with my obsolete
nickname, or whether I am gay or just happen to be someone who doesn't
think they should be disrespected.  And what the hell was that
nonsequiter about architecture having nothing to do with
homosexuality?  A typical example of you falsely trying to twist the
issue in a way that suits you and fans the flames in which you seem to
revel, and I have no interest in having discussions with people who
pull this kind of shit.  And thanks for admitting that you don't have
a definition of "architecture".  I therefore expect you to stop using
the meaningless phrase "magnificent architecture" because one cannot
know whether an undefined quality is magnificent or not.  Adios, Mark,
and nice job of alienating one of your formerly strongest supporters.
