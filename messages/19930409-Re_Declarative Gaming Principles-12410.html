Somehow, it does. Since I am still struggling for a clear-cut definition I
don't really know. That's what I came here for. The big point about decl.
gaming IMHO is, that the player has IN THEORY to be able to access every
bit of data the game is comprised of and change it according to some meta-
rules. Just like in your game of chess. But could I, for instance, intro-
duce new pieces that don't move, but teleport? Could I change the goal of
the game, i.e. what to do to win? And could I change the meta-rules? Like
making a new rule on a roll of 1-6? Like making a new rule about making
new rules?

Most of the above had been done in various runs of the game.  I'll have
to go back and find my copy of the rules, but we had a set of "immutable
rules" which consisted of something like: Players alternate turns,
Players roll the die before moving and make a new rule on rolling a six
(couldn't change this one), The bit about nullifications, The winning
player is the first player to win, and no ferrits are permitted on the
playing surface.  Anything else could be changed.  I remember we made
rules giving some pieces really funky moves, but I don't remember adding
any extra pieces (but it wasn't forbidden).

Questions over questions. You see that a really decl. game can become very
chaotic in no time at all and thus become boring. So, that's why I contend
that a truly decl. game has to be an abstract one, where it doesn't matter
so much when suddenly things turn wild, because there are no interpretations
attached to things.
Or would you believe a wargame, where the tanks suddenly could fly?

This would make sense if the war was between groups with a VERY rapidly
changing tech level, or maybe an extremely high rate of evolution ;)

Still insane, DM
