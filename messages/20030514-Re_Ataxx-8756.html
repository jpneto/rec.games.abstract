<br><blockquote type=cite>I was "bitten" by the game ataxx recently and now am interested

<br>
<br>The rules? Oh, here they are: it's played on a 7x7 grid
<br>and if you're going to play it "in real life" then you probably
<br>want to use othello (i.e. reversible) pieces rather than go pieces
<br>because there's a lot of flipping. The start of the game
<br>looks like
<br>
<br>B.....W
<br>.......
<br>.......
<br>....... 
.......
<br>.......
<br>W.....B
<br>
<br>(let's call the players White and Black). Play alternates and when
<br>the board is full play ends. A play consists of two parts: firstly
<br>a player does a "move" and then some "flip"s. The move can be of
<br>precisely one of two forms: a player can either do a "spawn",
<br>which involves placing a new piece of his colour on a vacant
<br>square which is adjacent (in the "kings move" sense i.e. diagonals are OK)
<br>to a square already occupied by himself, or a "jump" which involves
<br>picking up one of his pieces and moving it two squares away
<br>(i.e. a place which can be reached by 2 kings moves but not by one).
<br>That's the end of the "move". The player has then occupied a previously
<br>unoccupied square and he then does the "flip", which involves
<br>flipping over all the pieces of his opponent which are one move
<br>from this previously-unoccupied square. 

<br>e.g. a full move looks like this: from
<br>
<br>.......
<br>.W..BB.
<br>......
<br>
<br>white could spawn a new piece e.g. giving
<br>
<br>..W....
<br>.W..BB.
<br>......
<br>
<br>or
<br>
<br>.......
<br>.W..BB.
<br>.W....
<br>
<br>or he could jump (and then flip), for example
<br>
<br>.......
<br>...WWB.
<br>......
<br>
<br>or 

<br>...W...
<br>....WB.
<br>......
<br>
<br>The game ends if and when no-one can move and the winner is the
<br>person with more pieces. 

<br>See <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ataxx.html">http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/ataxx.html</a> for more details.
<br>Note that one can play by email---I would be happy to take
<br>people on at this game because I'm a bit addicted to it at
<br>the minute: I am buzzard on "Richard's play by email server",
<br>feel free to challenge me if you are registered there.

<br>And since I'm the Richard of "Richard's play by email server"
<br>
<br>hehehe&nbsp;&nbsp; 8^)&nbsp; Feel free to challenge me (rrognlie) to ataxx or
<br>hexxagon (the hexagonal variant of the game)
<br>
<br>The strategy that I've found to work well is a 1 level min-max
<br>tree.&nbsp; you make a move that flips the most pieces (after your opponent's
<br>best response)&nbsp; If you go 2 or more levels... you get better results,
<br>but it's not practical for a person (or at least... not for <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>this<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
<br>person).
<br>
<br>That said... others on pbmserv regularly kick my ass...
