A WEEK AGO Combinatorics123 (aka Monsieur Buffoon) wrote in xkcd:
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Every big odd semi-prime n could be written as difference 
between 2 squares one of them leading to its factorization.
n=pq=y^2-x^2=(y-x)(y+x) where p=y-x and q=y+x

We know that the annulus area is equal to
Pi*(R^2-H^2)

My idea was to find some link between the 2 equations.
I`m not 100% sure on how to explain the link but it works (at least 
for numbers with less than 10 digits).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sure it works, Monsieur Buffoon :D  Why did you run away from the discussion if it works?  Explain your amazing theory, Monsieur Buffoon.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I`m still working on and I hope I did not miscalculate.
Knowing n but not the factors p and q (p and q odd primes) we can 
find the value of p^2+q^2 using the annulus properties.
Hence we can easily factorize n.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Oh sure, it's totally easy, Monsieur Buffoon.  If it's so easy, why did you run away without explaining yourself?

Care to elaborate? Or work out an example if you're not sure how 
to explain it?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Nobody knows what you're talking about, Monsieur Buffoon.  They ask you for an example because they know you're too stupid to explain yourself. 

YOU don't know what you're talking about, Monsieur Buffoon.  In math, just like in abstract games, you discuss variables that you failed to initially define.  No wonder you flunked out of college.

Is it related to Fermat's factorization method?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, Monsieur Buffoon's "theory" isn't related to anything intelligent.  He's just incoherently congratulating himself, as always, for his latest "amazing breakthrough", LOL

You could use the quadratic sieve for large numbers.

Guess at random x's and y's and calculate x^2 and y^2 mod n. If 
x^2=y^2 but x=/= +/- y, then take gcd(x-y, n) to get a 
non-trivial factor of n.

It's the second fastest known factoring method (according to
wikipedia).

Currently no known fast (polynomial time) factoring method is 
known.

Guys, you're wasting your time trying to attribute reason to Monsieur Buffoon's false claim.  He abandoned the xkcd discussion a week ago because he knows he's full of shit.  Instead he's back here in rga running his mouth.

Monsieur Buffoon, you'll never accomplish anything in prime numbers, just like you never accomplished anything in abstract games.  Why?  Because you're a nitwit.  You're incapable of inventing anything interesting.

You're so desperate to prove to everyone what a genius you are, Monsieur Buffoon.  You continually announce amazing breakthroughs and then run away without providing any details, because the details don't exist.

You embarrass yourself everywhere you go, Monsieur Buffoon.  Stop congratulating yourself for your non-accomplishments.
