People always have their excuses for doing nothing. What is more boring

American football with 1 minute of actual play in every 10? But American

People have been acclimated to football, and it has its pacing down
for it. They do enough between plays to do it.  I believe you actually
can learn how to make chess work, by studying how the do American
football.

I think this would be a disaster.

Trouble is, this is the view of media execs.

Sports like football, soccer
in Europe, etc. have a large following of people who have
never played the sport, and have no great interest in the
sport. Teams have a place within the culture and a following
that has little to do with the sport itself.

sure...

Interest in Fischer was similar. It wasn't about chess. It was
about an American beating a Russian at their own game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

it was a 'dramatic biography of a performance artist'?

what gained everyone's interest in Fischer can work the same for the guy 
hustling chess in the park. its not the game, its the hustle. watching 
football doesn't qualify you in the least for playing it

I think a far better model to study would be the treatment
of Go in Asia.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

all media is mass. chess is too small to appeal to as a mass market, and is 
a distinct niche market, therefore to use mass media its necessary to invoke 
mass interest

OR

otherwise go with the 'games channel' idea
