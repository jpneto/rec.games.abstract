Don't sweat it, Bill.  There's a principle, call it the Mark
principle, that I discovered the hard way: The more exciting a new
discovery is, the more likely it is to be flawed.

It took me about 8 hours of continuous work, with a 10 minute break
for lunch, to develop Mobius.  Gross time it's been a couple of years
since the first of many times I tried to create a win loss
complementary game for the mobius strip. I tested Mobius for a couple
of hours before announcing it to a few individuals.  Several hours
passed before I posted Mobius on the Internet.

Exactly 45 minutes transpired between the time you emailed me a
congratulations for Mobius and the time you emailed me the
announcement of your flawed variation, which you had already posted on
the Internet.  You gotta give it more time than that.

Mark
