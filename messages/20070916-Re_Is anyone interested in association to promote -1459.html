Luca at   ( <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.tavolando.net">www.tavolando.net</a> ) has done an excellent job creating a good 
regular magazine with images.  Only drawback to me being it is in Italian. 
I think, however, that the idea of a free pdf magazine is a better way to 
start than a printed magazine - though it would be great to have that 
eventually (and yes I still miss Abstract Games Magazine too).    Another 
advantage of the free pdf is that getting abstract games players to 
translate it won't be so much of an issue.   I got the Pacru rules 
translated largely by offering Pacru sets for translations to abstract games 
players, and I would think that Pacru Ltd wouldn't be the only company who 
would be willing to consider offering  games as rewards for translators of a 
regular magazine about abstract games (given say a link on the "back page").

Just a thought.

Cheers

Mike
