Nice set of constraints to work with.  Though I'm not sure that the
game tree is actually very big in practice, because of the small
branch factor combined with the forward-only movement.  I'd wager that
the tree is small compared to many other games.  Compare to Arimaa for
example, a game that comes to mind since it was designed under similar
kinds of constraints and is also a crossing game (though there wasn't
such a premium on simplicity in the Arimaa design, which of course
makes a big difference).

Haven't thought about it enough though.  Do you have calculations on
the size of the game tree?

New game: Basic

Basic is an extremely simple game for the Checkers set.  It's easy to
learn, easy to play, and easy to remember.  The design objective was
to construct the largest possible game tree using Checkers equipment.
Basic was originally intended as a simple exercise just to stimulate
the creative process.  I was surprised to find that this exercise was
actually was a robust game in itself.  It only needed some trivial
finishing touches.

I test played Basic several times in it's full form over the past
couple of days and didn't uncover any problems.  On a 4x4 board with 4
checkers, perfect play results in a win for Player 2.  On a 4x6 wide
board with 6 checkers, perfect play is a win for Player 1, I believe.
The game tree is a little unwieldy at the increased board size.

Mirroring by Player 2 leads to a win for Player 1, assuming Player 1
were to even allow mirroring which would be easy to thwart.  So
there's no incentive for Player 2 to mirror, which is very
encouraging.  Mirroring is always a concern with the ultra symmetric
Checkers set, having no center square.

How could such a simple rule set generate a substantial game tree?
Checkers equipment seems kind of minimal at first glance, compared to
something as grandiose as the Go set, but it isn't.  A stack has
number.  A stack has order.  That order can underlie vast expanses of
game tree in a naturally finite game (no tiebreaker baloney) if you
make efficient use of that order in the design.  E.g. no capturing.
Every time you remove a piece from the board, you hack off huge
portions of the tree.  No multi-move, tree hacking turns, etc.

Is Basic free of flaws?  Not necessarily.  Its very simplicity is
troublesome, but I resisted the temptation to add complications during
design.  I'd rather just see it die than tamper with its marvelous
simplicity.
