Sure win

Within this letter I refer to rules described in my letter The 
Rules and History of Renju and  otherFive In A Row Games
which I finally succeeded to send in its complete form to this 
newsgroup except from the figures that I was not able to send 
in the right way.

The 1st time I played in the Swedish Championship 1988 I did 
not know about the japanese books on  the sure win and when I 
received the books from Japan about the sure win I was very 
sursprised. In Sweden we played with the rules 1-2 i.e. the 
completely free rules on a big piece of paper. After getting 
several japanese books on the sure win I began to analyse 
myself because I thougt that there was were big lacks in the 
presentation of the winning system.  I had to work very much 
to find the win in many situations within the winning system. It 
was the same as the system presented in the book Five In A 
Row/Renju by Ikawa and Sakata. However after some years  I 
had a lot of additional analyses and also other Swedish players. 
At that time, 1980,   6 Swedish players  know so much how to 
win that playing became boring. Before a tournament I had to 
revise what I had to know by heart for many hours. Our skills 
also had increased so that if the other player tried foolish 
variations for example  the nonadjacent  first move as white we 
could still win.  However the best way to have a chance as white  
against a good program using the sure win system as black  is 
to put the second stone not adjacent to the first stone. 

The sure win  presented in Five In A Row/Renju is the sure win 
with rules 1-5. To win with these rules are much more difficult 
than with rules 1-2. However using rules 1-5 there are still a lot 
of sure win situations. I have more information on which of the 
main 13x2=26 openings within the first three moves that give 
sure win for black but I cannot send it with e-mail. However I 
can send this information via fax. Please, write to me if you 
want  this information.

As you sure will understand it is possible for all players at least 
when there are short time to think to make mistakes. So, 
players cannot always win. As a matter of fact most of the good 
players today have not given these old analyses so much time so 
that they can always win. Sometimes I use tactics and I hope to 
lure the opponent into a variation that he cannot master. This 
tactics, however, is often not successful. Even if the players do 
not know the exactly way to win  they usually finally  will win  
because there are so many ways to win without using the 
quickest way when you receive too much initiative. There is a 
rumour that one of the best japanese players have found a fault 
in the presented winning systems but this fault will probably be 
solved quick if the fault will be published.

In the game Five-In-A-Row (rule a-f)  a win is probably found 
when using indirect (diagonal) opening but not  yet when using 
direct opening. 

In the game Pente Rollie Tesh thougt there is a win for White 
(the beginner) but I analysed some variations presented by him 
and found no win so I am not completely sure of the win.

Some of you seems to have a theoretical interest in the game. 
Do you know that two scientist s at CERN  Sverker Johansson 
and Torbjorn Lindelov 1985 presented more abstract 
definitions and rules of renju more close to computer language.

Seeing your knowledge about Allis you probably also know 
about  Heuristic Programming in Artificial Intelligence, the 1st 
computer olympiad: A Mathematical Model for Go-Moku. 
A.K. Frolov. His conclusion: There exists a finite algorithm 
describing the winning procedure.

Friendly Yours,
