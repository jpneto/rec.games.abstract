So, the "Y" state is expanded into 19 different states internally (if I
have counted correctly), 10 of which are terminal, and 9 of which are
not yet "long enough" to end the game.  These states do not have any
loopiness, so they can be analyzed normally.

This seems like a very good way in theory, but in practice, the number

Aha! I seem to have found a much simpler way, if my logic is correct. 
Let me know if I have reasoned incorrectly.

Under the simple assumption that repetition of position in a game is a
draw and has the game-theoretic value of zero (as is the case with
chess), the last step of the retrograde analysis algorithm requires
that all remaining unsettled positions are set to 0.

Now, if we modify the assumption to a more complex one in some
unspecified abstract finite zero-sum game that says the game-theoretic
value of a draw-by-repetition depends on the actual position that
repeats (note that a dependence on the position does not automatically
imply that the game-theoretic value depends on the move history, which
would be a stronger condition!), then we have the following situation:

I assert that the last step of the retrograde analysis algorithm has
unsettled positions set to 0 because each unsettled position in the
database has the feature that either there is no move possible from
this position that leads to a non-repeating position <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>or<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> the value of
a draw-by-repetition (which is zero under the simple assumption) is
greater than the value obtainable through any non-repeating move.

As we use the endgame database then, the first time we come across
such a position that is unsettled in this way, we know that the best
move leads to a repeat and draw, whether the actual drawing condition
is:
(1) positions that only can repeat are automatically draws
(2) draw-by-repetition only take effect after N repetitions of a
position

So my thought is that in the case that draw-by-repetition does not
automatically lead to a value of 0, we only need to statically
re-examine the unsettled positions and the game-theoretic value of the
children positions and evaluate each of these unsettled positions as a
terminal position with a game-theoretic value of whatever is greater
of the game-theoretic value of a draw in the present position or
greatest child game-theoretic value of all positions which are
children to the present position under consideration.

The nuance is that we can not propagate the value of such
draw-by-repetition terminal positions onto it's parents, which could
be other draw-by-repetition terminal positions!  For example, in the
case where draw-by-repetition position X has a game-theoretic value of
+2 and draw-by-repetition position Y has a game-theoretic value of +4,
then if we are presented with a repetition as:
... X Y X Y X (2nd repetition, terminal value = +2), but
... Y X Y X Y (2nd repitition, terminal value = +4)
We could have the situation that as we walk the endgame database
evaluating repeating positions as terminal values, that these values
could end up being passed on to their parents.  In this case, if we
visit (and evaluated) position Y before position X, then we might
erroneously end up with both Y and X with a terminal value of +4!  In
order to avoid this error, we have to copy unsettled positions and
update the values in our copy through evaluation in the original
database.  Then when we are finished walking the values in our copy,
we can mirror these back into the original database.

In this way, I have addressed this complex-valued draw-by-repetition
problem with negligible additional effort and at the cost of only some
additional memory (for an intermediary copy of the unsettled values).

Are there any holes in my reasoning?  Can other cases of state
expansion in game trees be solved similarly?
