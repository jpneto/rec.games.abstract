The matter of "equalization" is a pressing one, in many games.

That is, in games where there is a massive advantage to playing first, 
(most of them !), how to try and overcome this. 

One way, of course, is just to play two games simultaneously. But in real life
this gets a little distracting.  Another method is to give one player first
move, and then each player two moves in turn. But this tends to make it a
whole new game, with quite different tactics and strategy, (though these 
variants are often quite fascinating in their own right).

But now we have just seen posted a simple equalizing method, by David Bush, 
(in a post about Twixt).  It seems applicable to almost any game, is very simple,
hardly changes the play of the game at all, and seems very fair.

=============
PLAYER ONE just plays 2 moves for white and 1 for black. Black will move next.

PLAYER TWO then elects to be either black or white. The game proceeds normally.
=============

BRILLIANT !  This three-move equalization should really become standard !
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            
It is not a new idea of course, being a (thankfully!) simplified version of a
standard method of equalizing Go-Moku by Japanese experts.  But it is so simple
that it really ought to become more well known.

It would have good effects, too, in chess, where the openings are too well
analysed to give the non-reader an equal chance with the reader of chess mags.

I said it "seems very fair".  And so it is, in principle, at least. Of course
there may be games where three moves simply can't <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>be<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> picked that leave an
equal situation, simply because the moves are too coarse in their effects. But
I suspect these games would be a bit unsatisfactory anyway.  Most standard games
and others menbtioned in this group seem very amenable to "3-move equalaization".

The main objection to fairness would be that in practice, it's a bit like
one-person-cutting-the-cake-and-the-other-choosing. Everyone wants to be the
chooser, because they don't trust themselves to be able to cut fairly !!
Well, too bad.  But most people couldn't be relied on to decide which color
had the advantage, either !  And the mere fun of having three moves to play
first, would ensure a plentiful supply of volunteers to be PLAYER ONE.

So then...... LETS HEAR IT FOR "THREE-MOVE EQUALIZATION" !!!!!

  Of course I'm not cheating my employer by spending 3 hours a day on the net.
     I'm just using the time I would have spent fiddling with weird games !
