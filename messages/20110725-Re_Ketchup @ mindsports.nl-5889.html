Criticizing a game as an entity is obviously fair game.
You picked one rule and used it to argue, out of context, against finitude.

I have nothing against finitude if it comes naturally. But robbing the
babies of their natural behaviour with a hardwired 'solution' before
determining the extent of the problem is silly. But then, Mark's
cyclophobia is silly of course, and making the queens mobile drains is
an artificial 'one purpose' rule.
I also don't get the two never to be born babies, not even to keep up
the facade of a stacking game.

Thanks, I'll remember that. Makes it so much easier to refute Mark's

I really don't want to take sides in an ongoing argument between two
of my favorite game designers, maybe my top two in fact, something I
hate to see in the first place.  Maybe I should have stayed out.  My
only interest was in trying to keep the debate logical.
