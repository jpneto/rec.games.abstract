With the three people in Berlin I wouldn't hesitate to do
the final say in video form for a few reasons. One is that
you'd get to actually see these mysterious people.
Another is that it just sounds like a fun project to finalize
with a video.

I like the video idea too.  I'd like to see all the games reviewed though,
or at least the top two or three, not just the winner.

Daniel, just to avoid misunderstandings and to establish some ground rules,
are we all on the same page with the games being judged on their quality of
play?  Only?  You really threw me a curve with your announcement that Monkey
Queen might not qualify, six weeks into the contest, while acknowledging
that the loosest definition of stacking game had already been agreed upon at
the outset.  I appreciate all the work you're putting into the contest but
for me, suggesting that Monkey Queen might not qualify while knowing full
well that it does qualify casts a shadow of doubt on how responsible you
are.  Why pull an obnoxious stunt like that?  Because Ralf Gering told you
to?

I don't want to watch a video of the judges effectively disqualifying Monkey
Queen by saddling it with deductions for "not really a stacking game" as
well as "bad theme",etc. - all the stupid shit that judges with no knowledge
of the contest parameters could dream up.  Can we agree that the judges will
judge the games on their quality of play only?
