P.S.  My favourite game of all time though?  That I could play for days
and days straight?  Bridge.  Yes you need 4 players, but for me it is
the optimal combination of social interaction and stimulating depth of
play.  You could spend a lifetime mastering this one too.

When the home-computer age arrived, one of the first things I did was
buy chess software (Chessmaster 2100) so that I could finally practice
enough to become a decent chess player (not master the game--just
become a decent player).  Later, I bought software for the game of go,
so that I could finally learn to play (I'd owned a go set for ten or
fifteen years, but I'd never learned to play).  And a little later, I
bought bridge software so that I could finally learn to play that game.

I've read a couple books on bridge and played at it on the computer,
but I've yet to play a real, live game.  About five years ago, I
thought I might, because I met someone who was a "life master" and
wanted to get a group together (he was also an international master at
chess)--but we didn't get started right away, and he died.

I don't think bridge will ever be "my game," but I'm glad I took time
to learn how to play.  It's one of those super-popular things I heard
about all my life but never personally encountered.  When I was a kid,
my family played rummy.  As popular as bridge is, I'm surprised that
I've known so few people who play it.

My online research suggests that bridge, like checkers, seems to be in
sharp decline.  The average bridge player is even older than I am.

Meanwhile, some playing-card fans complain that bridge only became
popular because Ely Culbertson hyped it up so much.  In truth, they
say, there are better card games around:  Skat, for example, and maybe
Sheepshead.

I wouldn't know, though.  Rummy and cribbage are more my speed.
