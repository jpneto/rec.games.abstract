I assume one of these is Winning Ways, Vol. 4.  What's the other one? 
Volume 4 is only $40 at Amazon.com, not too bad if you're serious about 
the subject; I don't think volume four assumes too much familiarity with 
the earlier volumes.  You might also want to check local university 
libraries (if any, many people overlook these although they are 
generally open to the public).

My university library doesn't have it.

I know, for example, that there are some necessary conditions called
"pagoda functions". Can someone explain me how to use and generate
this functions? Can i use a pagoda function with an arbitrary
configuration
of pegs?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A pagoda function is a function defined over the board so that no jump 
can increase the value of the board.  So, if the desired ending position 
is one peg in the center, and this position has value 1, any position 
with a value less than 1 is bad.  The function doesn't change for 
different peg configurations, but one can use multiple pagoda functions 
to prune the search tree probably much faster than what you are doing. 
I don't know if there are algorithms to develop pagoda functions for 
arbitrary sized boards, that might be an interesting area of research.

What do you mean for "desired ending positions"?
I use a brute-force search, with a cache, look-ahead and an evalutation
function that try to order the edges of the search tree to catch the best
moves first.
But if there are 25 or more pegs and there is an error at deep 1 or 2, than
the program take too long to backtrack at that level...

In practice, how can i use the pagoda function to cut the search space?
