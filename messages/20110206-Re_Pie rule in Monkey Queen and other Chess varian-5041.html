My proposal:  player one decides how large the initial white and black
stack will be (12-13 is my best guess at fair, 15-17 for if you want
seperation of 2), then player 2 chooses whether to play white or
black.
I think this is much more fair, and much more natural to the game.

I find this an interesting proposal. Of course the numbers are 'best
guesses', and to what they would eventually converge is not really
relevant for the idea. Only massive numbers of games between
'reasonably advanced' players would be.

Of course there's the 'best play' criterion and in this respect MQ may
be elusive. A strategy in general terms may not be too difficult to
formulate, but specifying it may be less easy. MQ is very 'fluid'
because there are no pawns to provide a framework for more or less
permanebt advantageous sub-goals to be achieved.

Anyways, now for so more fun comments:

Fischer was soooooooo wishy washy it isn't even funny.  Fischer lost
to the king's gambit, so he did a lot of opening preperation,
declaired the king's gambit dead, proceeded to use the king's gambit,
then declaired that chess is dead due to opening preperation, then
only showed his face to play chess, never "Fischer Random Chess" [with
or without his stupid stupid stupid castling rule]

I couldn't agree more:

Calling Chess-960 "Weird Shuffle Chess" isn't even a pleonasm. The
'weird' part is his castling rule.

Checkers is dead to learn how to play well, as there is now just a set
script to follow after you learn strategic details.  However, the
concept of checkers is not dead.  10x10 english checkers isn't solved,
and in fact, checkers would be very hard to solve in general, as you
could always move one board size up (and the strategic themes still
makse sense as you increase teh board size).  In fact, most games are
like this, you could always just play on a larger board .  Chesses are
one of the only games where this is not really possible beyond a point
(you can make logical adaptations like grand chess, but where would
you go from there?)

As it happens Benedikt Rosenau and I are working on an e-book or app
called "On the Evolution of Draughts Variants" and there's a lot to
say about Draughts in this regard. First and foremost, Draughts
variants in general hardly suffer from any first move advantage. Dutch
10x10 grandmaster Hans Jansen [<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>
Hans_Jansen_(dammer)] is known for caring little about the general
measure of 'progress' of his position, as long as the tempo conditions
are in his favour: in Draughts one can have a huge advantage in
general progress and yet get stuck in a web of bad continuations.

Regarding boardsize, Malaysian, Sri Lankan and Canadian progressed to
12x12 and never made it to 'international'. Draughts is not
'infinitely scalable'. Playing it on 20x20 is about as interesting as
playing it on 4x4. That suggests a game of maximum interest, somewhere
in between.
The chronic illness of Draughts has a different source than bordsize.

If a move can
have a negative impact (chess, go if viewed as a specific move rather
than an available move (passing is an available move which has no
negative impact), then the following moves must make your move
meaningful, thus setting the coarse for the rest of play, thus
offering a smaller subtree than the original tree driven back one tier

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I agree, but that's precisely my point. The tree is larger than its
branches, but given the size of the tree, every branch look a tree. A
different departure point gives different but very similar problems.
