Hello, all...

I recently invented an abstract game called Kechi which has a few
properties, gamewise, that make it a bit more interesting that one
might initially expect;  it's on the games page of my website if
you want to download it, print out the board, and try it out with
friends.  We got a lot of play out of it during lunch breaks when
I was at Harbinger, and I've finally put it into a format I can
easily give out on the Web.

There are two things which make it a bit unusual:

1)  On a player's turn, the pieces are moved a total of six
    spaces, rather than any piece having a specific distance
    that it must travel, and

2)  When a piece is moved, the origin space is no longer a
    valid destination on subsequent moves.  Essentially, the
    board "shrinks" by one to four spaces each turn.

Like in chess, capture of the opponent's pieces is by replacement,
and also like in chess, the winner is the last person capable of a
valid move.

Given the unique shape of the board and the conditions above,
the following questions arise:

1)  What is the longest possible game, in turns?  [Keep in mind
    that at some points in the game, more than one may be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>forced<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
    to move as the number of valid destinations decrease.]  Upper
    bounds on this are easy to find, but proving a longest game
    still seems to be a challenge.

2)  Does either player have a significant advantage on this board?
    (So far, playtesting seems to say "no".)  If so, what can be
    done to remove it?

3)  It's easy to create variant boards that force a win by either
    first <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>or<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> second player, but are there any boards with <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>no<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
    advantage?

The variant games suggested offer other challenges, too, but I'm
more interested in seeing what people can figure out about the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>main<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> board.
