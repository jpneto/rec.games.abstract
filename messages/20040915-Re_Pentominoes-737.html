There was indeed a similar game released for the Gameboy to the one
you propose, but played with hexagonal pieces on a hexagonal board. It
is called Hexcite, and I do have a copy, with a rather strong computer
opponent. It has some additional restrictions and scoring options as
well.

I don't think it sold very well, but it is not a bad game.

Carl Johan

  Pentominoes really struck a major amount of chords

Exactly, Nate, and I enjoyed the rest of your posting too. Many thanks to all who responded to 
my request. Incidentally, I also have a double set of pentominoes, black and white, but play 
them on an 11 x 11 board with the centre square off limits. I've also experimented with a 
partnership version on this board.

Here's one 8x8 variation I came up with which I think adds a bit of interest. I have a much 
better game, but it requires illustrations with diagrams, so I'll put it on my web site in due 
course and will post an announcement when it's done. (Won't be for a while yet.)

Whenever you place a pentomino on the board so that it lies edge to edge with a previously 
placed piece, a certain number of its constituent squares will abut those of another piece. 
For example, if you place the I piece lengthwise against the top bar of the T it will abut 
three such squares. So you score three points for doing so. Following the same principle, each 
in turn places a piece on the board and scores 1 point for each of its squares which abuts a 
square of any and all adjacent pieces. The winner is the player with the greatest total when 
no more pieces can be played, a typical score being about 32 (perhaps not surprisingly). The 
first player scores zero on the first turn, of course.

I suppose this version might be called Pointominoes...
