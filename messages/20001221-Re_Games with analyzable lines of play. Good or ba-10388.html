We just have no way of knowing at the moment how difficult it is to
solve chess.  So it seems unwarranted to make a prediction one way or
the other.

And there are many orders of magnitude more atoms in the sun than there
are chess positions.  So if we transform even a single star into a
digital computer, we could reasonably imagine building a system that
would in fact store the value of every chess position.

The fraction of legal chess positions that would ever need to be reached
in a strategy that would completely solve the game of chess as played
from the standard opening position would be many many many orders of
magnitude less than the total number of chess positions.  And "never" is
a really really really long time.

This seems wrong on two counts:

1. The game might be a win for Black (although this seems unlikely).
2. If you demonstrate a forced draw for White, that still leaves unknown
   whether the game is a win for White or a draw for White.
