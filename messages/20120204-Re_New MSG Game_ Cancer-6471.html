TOP TEN REASONS FOR BEING DUTCH
1. You can get arrested for growing plants, but not for smoking them.
2. You can make jokes about the Belgians and still drink their beer.
3.a. You can legally kill yourself.
3.b. You can legally be killed.
4. You're exactly like the Germans, except that nobody hates you.
5. You think you are a world power, but everyone else thinks
Copenhagen is your capital...
6. You get to insult people and defend yourself by saying it's a
national tradition.
7. You can put your finger in a dyke and it will save your country.
8. You live in the most densely populated country in Europe, and still
you've never seen your neighbours.
9. If the economy is bad, blame the Germans. If a war is started,
blame the Germans. If you lose your keys, blame the Germans.
10. Bikes are public property. Locks are a challenge.
