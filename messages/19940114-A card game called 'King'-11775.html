Howdy!

This is the closest newsgroup I could find likely to be read by folks who might know . . .

I used to play a game somewhat like bridge, i.e. a four-handed game involving
bidding at some points and various trick-avoiding/trick-taking strategies.

I learned it from a FOAF from Portugal, who called it 'King'.

It involved several hands, in one of which players tried to avoid taking men,
queens, tricks, hearts, the king of hearts, and then four hands involving
bidding based on the number of tricks players anticipated taking.  Actually
rather similar to hearts and spades I suppose.  Points were undesirable.

It was a great game, but I've lost the point scheme for the various rounds.

Can anybody point me in the right direction?

Thanks much.

Tim
