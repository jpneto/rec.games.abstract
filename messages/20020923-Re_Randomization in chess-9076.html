Hi Douglas,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
It might depend on the actual position, and the results might be hard to compare between decisions, even if they seem conclusive for a
particular pair of moves. The variations should not have immediate direct tactical effects on the differences between the plays, e.g., such
that in the first position, 60% of the variations would immediately drop a piece, whereas from the other position only 30% would. Such
tactical variations might have their place if you were practicing to play speed chess against a computer, I supposed, but I'm looking for
more than that.

It seems that you have some interesting ideas here, but, I'm not sure
I quite understand what you are trying to achieve. Are you looking for 
ways to further study the game of Chess through a series of "testing"
positions and their potential strengths...or are you trying to figure
out a way to blend chance elements into the game of Chess for the 
interest of developing a workable diversion to Chess?

Without a clearer goal in mind, it's hard for me to see the purpose
of what you are suggesting. It looks as if any of these scenarios 
would require a lot of trials before anything conlcusive would result.
However, it may lead you in a direction that will help you resolve
what you are lookin for. It's an intersting train of thought that
may lead somewhere new and exciting, but, it could take a lot of coal
and a lot of people shoveling. The key would be to have some nice
tracks to ride on to help inspire others to keep the train movin'. :-)

Regards,
Scott Pardee
