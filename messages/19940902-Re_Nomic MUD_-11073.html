My question is- is there any kind of a Nomic MUD back up on the internet?   
The faq mentioned one but said it was shut down, and I was wondering if  
this was still the case.  If there is not, is there any kind of place I  
can go to play/get more info about Nomic?

The FAQ, if it's the one I'm aware of, should have mentioned several WWW
sites with information about various nomic games including people to contact
in those games.  You can start your WWW search with our page
http:://kepler.valpo.edu/nomic/index.html - I list it not because it's the
best, but because I know the address.

Our game is played via a shared account and a mailing list.  It runs much
slower than many of the games that I am aware of.  But, we are interested in
adding a few more players.  Our numbers have dwindled and we'd like some
fresh blood.  Particularly, we lost out token female.  Any out there who
would care to join?
