Also, surely some smaller games (such as Connect-Four, the thing where you'd
drop checkers into this slot thing, trying to get four-in-a-row.  I'm
not sure of its dimensions, but it woudln't seem too difficult to do)
have been "solved".  Has anything interesting been found?

I have saved a couple of articles posted on Connect-Four to
rec.games.programmer in October 1988.  First one on the October 1 by
James D. Allen <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:jamesa%betelgeuse@Sun.COM">&lt;jamesa%betelgeuse@Sun.COM&gt;</a> who wrote that he had
solved 7-by-6 Connect-Four and showed that the first player can win if
he starts in the central column (other first moves not checked) by
alpha-beta pruning.

Then on October 16 Victor Allis <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:victor@cs.vu.nl">&lt;victor@cs.vu.nl&gt;</a> wrote about a
program VICTOR which proved again that it was a win for the first
player, but without building a search tree, but from an evaluation
function "based on 9 strategic rules concering the game, which all
nine have been (mathematically) proven to be correct" that sometimes
can decide that a position is a win or a non-win for white.

| Using the evaluation function alone, it has been shown that Black
| can at least draw the game on any 6 x (2n) board. VICTOR found an easy
| strategy for these boardsizes, which can be taught to anyone within 5
| minutes. Nevertheless, this strategy had not been encountered before
| by any humans, as far as I know.
| 
| For 7 x (2n) boards a similar strategy was found, in case White does not
| start the game in the middle column. In these cases Black can therefore at
| least draw the game.

If anyone is interested in the full text of those two articles, please
mail me and ask about it.
