Hi folks,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In your post you discussed the space and size required to store a
complete solution.  I would like to remind you that at one time; it was
not considered feasible that anyone would need more than 640KB of
memory, the faster a computer got-the larger it would have to be, the
turing test was considered unobtainable, and a slew of other things
that through human innovation we have proven mythical.

Well, as soon as we develop a technology that allows every single atom
in the universe to be used for storage in solving a boardgame, it'll
happen. 2020's a bit optimistic.

You don't need every atom in the universe - the question is how long it
takes to traverse the tree, not store the results. After all, you can put a
marker at any node where there's a forced win or draw below it, and free up
the subtree for use in the rest of the problem.

Of course, this would mean the storage requirements when you were done would
be very simple - a mark in the top node saying either "White wins", "Black
wins", or "Draw."

I'd characterize the amount of time needed to do the traversal as "too
damned long."
