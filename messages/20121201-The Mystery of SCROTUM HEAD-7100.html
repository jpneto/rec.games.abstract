One of the great mysteries of the 21st century is how Christian Freeling's head transformed into a giant scrotum.  The only rational explanation I can think of is that, like Jeff Goldblum in "The Fly", Christian got into a molecular transporter.  Only instead of a fly getting into the transporter with him, it was an extra scrotum.  

Ed and Christian do everything in the labrAtory naked, and when Ed slammed the transporter door shut with Christian inside, Ed's scrotum swung forward and got caught in the door.  Christian could see Ed screaming in pain and pounding on the viewport with his fists.  Christian looked down the door jamb and saw Ed's nuts pinched into the chamber, but there was nothing either could do.  The door, once closed, is controlled by the computer.

During the transport, Ed's nuts vaporized and incorporated genetically with Christian Freeling.  The first sign of trouble was when Christian's head began wobbling constantly, exactly like a scrotum.  Later, Christian's head actually turned into a big, red, wrinkly scrotum, and the birth of SCROTUM HEAD was complete.
