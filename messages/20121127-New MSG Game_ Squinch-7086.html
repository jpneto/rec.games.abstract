8x8 checkerboard.  24 red singletons in first 3 rows.  24 white singletons opposite.  The goal is to bear all of your checkers off the far end of the board.  Draws and impasses can't happen.

Mono-colored stacks only.  No capturing.  No passing unless no moves available. One player will always have a move.  The two players, Red and White, only move checkers of their own color and make no more than one move per turn.  Red goes first.

Singletons move directly or diagonally forward one square to an unoccupied square or onto a friendly stack (which could be a singleton).  A singleton can also move sideways one square onto a friendly stack.  

The top checker of a stack can be moved in a straight line, directly or diagonally forward, a distance of from 1 to n squares, n being the height of the originating stack (including the top checker before it's moved), to an unoccupied square or onto a friendly stack of any height.  Said checker can pass over intervening stacks of any height and of either color.

The top checker can also be moved sideways (from 1 to n squares) onto an equally sized or taller friendly stack (than the originating stack including the top checker before it's moved).  Again, intervening stacks don't block such moves.
