With all the discussion about Kalah going on, it looks like everyone's
playing by a slightly different set of rules. Also, since, as someone
noted, it's pretty impolite to start a discussion without telling
everyone the rules to the game, I thought it about time someone posted
the complete rules to Kalah.

Kalah is played on a board made of fourteen pits, arranged like this :


                            Player Two
       Two's             X  X  X  X  X  X         One's
     scoring pit -&gt;   X                    X &lt;- scoring pit
                         X  X  X  X  X  X
                            Player One


Each player has seven pits - six which are initially filled with stones,
and one scoring pit, at first empty, on his right. Each non-scoring pit
contains six stones, although beginners sometimes play with three.

Play starts with either of the players. A move is made by removing the
stones from one of your pits (excluding the scoring pit), and placing
them, counter-clockwise, one per pit - with the exception of your
enemy's scoring pit, which you skip. If the last stone lands in your
scoring pit, you are allowed to make another move - there is no limit
to the number of times you can do this in your turn. On the other
hand, if your last stone lands in an empty pit - and this pit is on
your side - you remove both the stone that landed in the empty pit
and all the stones in the pit opposite yours, and place them in you
score pit.

After you have finished your move, your opponent moves, with play
alternating betwteen the players. Play continues until there are no
stones on one side of the board. At this point, the player with stones
remaining takes all of the stones from his pits and places them in his
scoring pit. The winner is the player with the most stones in his score
pit.

As someone noted earlier, there is a computer program available for IBM
PCs, KALAKH.ZIP, which is available at most IBM game archives. (Last
place I saw it was in the games directory of wuarchive's umich mirror.)

If anything's not clear about the rules, feel free to ask.
