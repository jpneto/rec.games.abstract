Now ... these so-called bright people are being asked to do a
couple days of this.  All you hear is the grumbling ("I didn't
go to [sic] college (actually trade school) to learn how to
program so I could end up doing this", or "how is this going
to help me?") and various other gripes you typically get like
when a spoiled Hollywood is asked to do some restaurant work in
the kitchen.

But the REALLY bright one proceeded to do this:

Boredom on routine tasks (e.g. some mind-numbing 
hand-reformatting of a large data file), often leads me
down paths like this. I'll typically end up developing
some interesting algorithm to solve the problem, just
as Alfred suggests. And this is true for physical
examples like Alfred's as well as data-processing
examples like mine.

And no, it's not multidimensional.  This is the SAME brightness that
made this person so damn good at their work where, in fact, their
performance is showing the very same 3-fold, 4-fold, etc. disparity;
as well as in nearly every other task he performs.

However... I have found that the comparison frequently
goes in the other direction. When I found myself
routinely outperformed by data-techs on routine data-processing
jobs, by a factor of 2 or more, I decided it really was
a waste of everybody's time for me to do those things
myself.

I think what is required is a moderate amount of
intelligence and a real enjoyment of routine work. I asked
the best datatech in question about this, and she told
me she really did enjoy that kind of work. She was
always looking for more. She had the capability to
learn to program and was in fact taking programming
courses, but she really got her kicks from being
an expert applications user.

Despite Jon Miller's protest, it was routinely a factor
of 2, and a factor of 3 was not unusual.
