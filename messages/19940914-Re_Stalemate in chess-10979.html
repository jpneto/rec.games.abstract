I would personally suggest a modification of the old Lasker system, awarding
3/4 to a player who gives stalemate and 1/4 to the stalemated player. (In
draws-not-counting matches, it would be half a win.)

No one's ever accused me of being a chess traditionalist (I usually only play a
variant I invented myself, which regular chessplayers claim is unrecognizable
as chess or at least very unchesslike).

     Still, this is why I support the STATUS QUO:

     1) The thrill goes out of the game when you give all power to the predator
(the player with a temporary or permanent advantage). No more chance of the
rabbit eluding the fox, etc. No incentive for the behind player to do anything
but resign <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Yawn<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> -- more boring to me by far than some wily player forcing a
stalemate. These are <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>usually<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> cleverer than most mates. Like the behind player
gets either stalemate or perpetual check or regains a piece. In some cases the
fear of stalemate leads to the behind player catching up to the ahead player.

     2) But that's not all. What if you are mass ahead and are the only player
who can possibly mate. I assume you want to push it in the direction of
rewarding the strong player (Like I said, I don't care to, necessarily). Well,
what if I can stalemate you somehow? In a normal game it is a bolt from the
blue, no doubt. (This would be a small endgame.) Normally we both see the
potential and call it a draw, if inevitable. Now I press for the stalemate,
even though I may have tossed away pieces, have bad structure, etc. If I can
stave off mate and create a sitch where you go behind or get stalemated, isn't
that a problem? Also, in some games a behind player also behind in the match
needs to try for a win, so they avoid a possible stalemate. Now they chuckle
and go for it. Less chance of a clean win, then. And freak stalemates are
easier to overlook than freak mates.

     3) Just as we now have a class of stalemate, perpetual check, etc. players
who are hell on D and hard to mate, we would get a new breed of "play for the
stalemate" players who would specialize in 3/4 win nickel-and diming you to
death. Matches might be draws and stalemates and the (very rare) occasional
win. Sound exciting??? On the other hand, giving a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>win<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to the stalemater
seems to me both boring and unfair. I mate you like 5 times and you get 6
stalemates, so you win?????

     4) Also, why not a win for the one who can give perpetual check? This
causes far more draws, I bet, than stalemate. Or this combined with ways of
forcing repetition by 3-time position rule, which to me is a variant of
perpetual check. If I can always keep you in check, or <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>make<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> you scuttle
back-and-forth between the same small group of positions for all eternity,
shouldn't I get credit for it? In fact this involves more work on my part than
most stalemates, maybe the majority of mates for that matter.

     5) And <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> major cause of draws is probably simple positional/material
equality at the end where good play by both will <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>never<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> let one player win.
If you really want to get rid of draws, why not give the player with name A-M
the point on even numbered days and the player with name N-Z on odd days, the
point for winning the game?

     6) Also, I like games where draws are possible. Only dorks like blowouts,
what's wrong with two evenly-matched players (or teams) going at it
intensively, and only occasionally one of them kills the other. This is why I
like soccer. Once my scrub team knocked the best team in the league out of the
championship with a draw. We were down 8 people to 7, they had all 15, and it
was hot (90+). Boring? People would have bet vast sums we couldn't do it, we
were scrubs even with a full team. I think everyone thought it was the most
exciting game of the season. Think of why Rocky was a good movie ... he went
the distance, not vanquished the champ like some fairytale character.
