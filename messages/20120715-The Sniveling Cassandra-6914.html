Christian Freeling quoting Fritzlein from three years ago in the Arimaa forum:

"I'm surprised [Christian] doesn't call himself Cassandra, gifted with 
prophecy, but cursed that no one will believe him."
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Christian, what exactly have you prophesied, other than the inevitable celebrity of your own games?  If you're cursed with incredulity, maybe you should stop prophesying.  Ever think of that?

Christian sniveled:

I have more than a quarter century of experience at 'being Cassandra' regarding Mu.  
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Shouldn't the quarter century in itself be a clue, Christian?  How many more decades of your sniveling must we endure?

I've heard remarkably little of Fritzlein about Symple and Sygo.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You've relentlessly nagged Fritzlein, your biggest fan, for a positive Sygo review for YEARS.  He must be regretting the day he ever complimented you.  If Fritzlein had something positive to say about Sygo, he would have said it by now.  Don't you think?

You're sabotaging your own legacy by berating your non-appreciative public, Christian.  Give them something to appreciate and they'll appreciate it.  Shoving Sygo in their face, year after year after year, does nothing to improve Sygo's image.  It just makes you appear narcissistic.  

Take Redstone.  The consensus is clear.  Redstone is brilliant.  No sniveling required.  

The consensus regarding Sygo is equally clear.  "Meh."  Your incessant sniveling won't change that.

If [games] are balanced, they have nowhere to go but deeper.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I'll agree to that.  But that doesn't mean people will like them.  Let's assume Sygo is the most balanced game ever (false because of Ketchup, engineered for balance).  That doesn't mean people will like it.  Tanbo is in the same boat.  Exquisitely well balanced.  Nowhere to go but deeper.  Yet only a tiny percentage of players are enthused about it.

Any insights?

Yes.  Do humanity a favor and SHUT THE FUCK UP !!!!
