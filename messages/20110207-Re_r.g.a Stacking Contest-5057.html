Christian, allow me to bop you over the head with the timeline here  :)  I

The time to register an objection would have been December 22, 2010, or
thereabouts.  Here's what you don't do: Extend a contest deadline and then
retract the extension two days before the old deadline.

I like the more relaxed time frame, which I think should be standard for our
annual contest, mainly because it takes the deadline pressure off.  It's
hard enough designing without time constraints.  Why make it even more
stressful with a hurried deadline?

Now that I've already entered Monkey Queen, I'm no longer hurried of course,
but back at the constest start, yes, the original suggestion of six weeks
was hurried by my standards.  Sometimes I can come up with a game that
quickly and sometimes I can't.  It took me a couple weeks just to get into
the stacking game mind frame after messing around with stone placement for
so long.

I don't know how Gamerman got to his 75% and 72%
first player wins, which seem oddly accurate for the
number of played games,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Not to speak for Gamerman, but I believe this statistic was based on his
programming of Monkey Queen and analyzing the program's self play.  Of
course the first move advantage is nowhere near 70% in human vs human play
at the current range of expertise.

but I was under the impression that the balancing
mechanism was still ... hanging in the balance, so
to say.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I've played more Monkey Queen than anybody at this point, and the current
balancing mechanism, the pie rule, is more than adequate to balance the game
for the current range of skill levels.  What determines the winner in Monkey
Queen is the ability to detect checkmate opportunities and effective
follow-through, not who moved first.  Gamerman beats me every time
regardless of who goes first, regardless of whether the pie rule is in
effect, and I'm quite certain, regardless of any new balancing mechanism we
might try - simply because he's a more skilled player.

If players become so skilled at Monkey Queen in the coming years that the
pie rule is no longer deemed adequate, then said skilled players can figure
out a more sophisticated balancing mechanism.  There's no way I'm going to
kludge out the rule sheet with some unnecessary, misguided "balancing"
mechanism designed by clueless, beginner Monkey Queen players that
accomplishes anything but.

Ready, fire, aim.  Let's develop a body of Monkey Queen strategy before
embarking on the quest for its perfect balancing mechanism.
