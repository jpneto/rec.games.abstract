] 
] While playing around the other day, I came up with a simple game that
] looks possibly interesting.  Has anyone seen this before, or is it
] new?  Assuming it's not new, is the strategy non-trivial.  Playing
] around with it seems to indicate that it might not be.
] 
] Rules:
] 
] Lay out a NxN grid of points: N=5 seems to work well.  Place an X in
] one corner between four points, an O in the opposite corner.
]

]        O
] . . . . .
] 
] The board can be thought of both as an NxN set of grid points, or a
] (N-1)x(N-1) set of squares.  The tokens sit in the squares, walls are
] built between grid points.
] 
] Players alternate turns.  On a players turn, they may either move
] their token or build a wall
] 
] A token (X or O) may move one square horizontally or vertically.  The
] token may not move onto the other token, and may not cross a wall.
] The board is periodic: motion off the board places the token on the
] opposite side. Moving off the board to the left places the
] token on the right in the same row, for example. 
] 
] A wall may be built between any two grid points: once built, it may
] not be destroyed.  Walls block movement by both tokens.
] 
] The first player to have their token surrounded by four adjacent walls
] loses: the game is a draw if placing a wall captures both tokens at
] the same time.
] 
] 
] Commentary?  There seem to be some obvious strategies, (Block opponent
] motion towards free areas, place walls are far from your position as
] possible, don't get caught in tubes, etc) but I haven't found an
] obvious winning/drawing strategy yet.

This game appears to have a pretty easy first player win. You just keep
attacking the other player's piece. If the other player stops defending
to attack you you will surround his piece first. If he keeps trying to defend,
his piece can be trapped along an edge in short order.
