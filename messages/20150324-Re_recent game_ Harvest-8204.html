This one I didn't like as much as the other two - what I read of it. I only read 3 pages and then was expected to install an app to finish reading it. But the rules seemed a little busy.  I like the fact that it has only one color though. As far removing split-off groups, there's another game based on the that.  If I think about it I might remember.

I agree with you in that this is my least favorite of the 3 games too. I'm sorry that scribd had some kind of restriction on guests, i wasn't aware of that. Membership there is free but you should just see them here instead: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/111778/rule-book">https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/111778/rule-book</a>

I think you should at least read the rest of the rules because IMO they all fit together in a nice way to accomplish their purpose. This was the first decent game i came up with. ( way back in 2012... Loops was in 2013, and Minimize 2014, i'm not very prolific :P ) 

Half of those 5 pages are just examples, here:

4x regular hexgrid starts out full with one unit type,
2 steps per turn (1 on very first for balance),
steps can be either direct removals or movements,
you can directly remove a single completely-surrounded unit, or
you can move any single unit in a straight line so long as it jumps at least one other unit and has at least one adjacent unit at the destination,
if there is more than one group after a movement only the largest remains (splitter chooses in case of equals),
at least one unit must be removed every turn either directly or by splitting or you lose,
when only two units are left in play whichever player has removed more units is the winner

Interesting.  Thanks for posting that.

yes, its a little more complicated than the best games, but at least the rules are still really intuitive. It was my first game where the drawlessness and the finiteness were totally natural, and fit together with everything else.

And trying to make a genuinely different game, with only a single unit type, really was a fun challenge. I'm sure you could find a better one :)

No, I've tried to come up with one-color games and just never really got anywhere.

You guys should make a contest out of it or something. I think simple little tactical games have their place too, not every game has to be "the new Go".

Contests seem like a great idea, and maybe they are.  But everyone gets anxious about the judges, if any can be found; will they playtest the game?  Can someone program the games because some are programmed and some aren't.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  Then finally someone's game gets selected for subjective, ultimately arbitrary criteria.  Real contests are useful.  But ad hoc, web forum, poorly planned - no, make that zero planning - contests always end up being a goat fuck for one reason or another.  Case in point: Nester's Nestor-dominated, Congratulations-To-Me contest.
