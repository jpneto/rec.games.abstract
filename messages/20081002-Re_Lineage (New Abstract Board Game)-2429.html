Do you think it is likely that having an online community of gamers
will translate into game sales? I am worried that perhaps people will
only play the game online, considering, as you have stated, that they
probably will not be able to find others in their area to play the
game with.

Yes, it may happen. Of the games I mentioned, I suspect many are
almost never played over the board. But Hive and the Gipf series are.
I would say it depends on your distribution channels. If you only sell
it through your website, I think it won't get much of an over the
board community (outside of where you live, possibly).

If this is the case, my board game may end up turning into just an

I think this may be a good idea. It is certainly a lot less risky than
trying to get your board for sale in boardgame stores. But keep
selling boards from your site, too, if you can.

Just thought of another quick question:

Do you by any chance know of any low-cost manufacturers with very low
or no minimums?
I've been struggling to find manufacturers with minimums less than 500
games. Obviously, being a student I don't have a lot of resources.

This is probably asking for too much, but my ideal manufacturer would
have a minimum of around 100-200 games, and be able to sell them to me
at $10 a game. I doubt these are realistic figures, though.

Thanks,
