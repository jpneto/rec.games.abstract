Arimaa is, in combinatorial game theory parlance, an infinite game.

After a couple years of serious play, Arimaa is already starting to
show signs of wear - drawish play.  It's not like I made this up.  I
read it in your forum.

"We have seen occasional positions that tended toward stalemate and
piece shuffling...  I consider it unlikely that playing to win at
Arimaa will drive us toward such corners of the position space,"

I consider it inevitable that Arimaa will drive itself into a corner.

"Several thousand games" don't mean squat when most of them were
between clueless beginners.  It's the current standard of expert play
you have to look at.

Arimaa seems to be poised for world domination, reading the Arimaa
forum.  Like Chess, Arimaa will be awash in draws before anything
resembling grandmaster level play emerges. Switching from Chess to
Arimaa would be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire,
minus the checkmate.

Arimaa has the exact same problem as Chess.  The fixed board size and
fixed set of pieces are set to make beginner and intermediate play
appealing, making them inadequate for extreme expert play.  Since the
games are non-scalable, experts can only repeatedly thrash a too
small, wrung out game.
