Clark, I was trying to attract a noteworthy designer to the group, but
now you've scared him off with your barnyard diplomacy, predictably.
Christian is not like you, someone with one interesting game.  Ralf
Gering has one interesting game.  A lot of designers have one
interesting game.

I'm starting another topic for Christian, since you've sabotaged this
one.  Can you please stay out of the new topic, at least until
Christian has had a chance to post there?
