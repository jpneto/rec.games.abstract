I think there are near infinite sets of rules, but here are the rules
for a commercial version sold in Australia.

Board consists of two rows of 4 ``bowls'' plus one extra bowl at either end.
The game starts with 4 markers in each of the 8 main bowls.
Each player is associated with one row of 4 bowls.
Each move consists of picking up all the markers in one bowl on your
side and placing one marker in each subsequent (anti-clockwise) bowl
(including those at each end).
Players alternate moves.
If the last marker placed is in an end bowl the player may move again
immediately.
Once a marker is in an end bowl it can never be moved again, so the game
must terminate.
The winner is the first player to have no markers in his/her bowls.

A fun game that can easily be played with rocks and circles drawn in the dirt.
The move again feature adds to the intellectual challenge by allowing
sequences of moves that result ``sudden'' victory from repeated extra moves.
