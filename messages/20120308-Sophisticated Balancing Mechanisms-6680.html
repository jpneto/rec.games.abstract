Nick Bentley's Ketchup has the most sophisticated balancing mechanism I know
of.  Ketchup appears to have been designed from the ground up with the
singular objective of balance.  Negative feedback maintains balance
throughout play.  You can't get much more balanced than that.

Less sophisticated balancing mechanisms blow their load at the beginning or
somewhere in the middle, after which play has plenty of time to get out of
whack again.

Ketchup being highly regarded is a victory for architecture.  Architecture
does not always triumph, but when it does, it triumphs big.

I'm not saying other balancing mechanisms aren't sophisticated, but...

I just think it's a little ballsy to claim the "most sophisticated"
balancing mechanism when your name isn't Nick.  And that it's a little petty
for an amateur to mount a huge argument against Redstone after numerous dan
level Go players have plainly demonstrated their enthusiasm.
