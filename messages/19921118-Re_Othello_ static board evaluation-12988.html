This seems reasonable to me, but in reality doesn't play very good.

This is the method used by most "beginners" trying to make an
evaluation function, and as you said it isn't very good. In my program
I use these factors:

 1) How many legal moves does the opponent have. A small number is
    good.

Be careful of this one! Remember, a good way of minimizing your opponent's
moves is to let him wipe you out (ie. he has 0 moves left). You should
try to also maximize your moves. This measure can be a difference
(ie. my moves - his moves) or a ratio (such as if I have more moves, the
score is (my moves + 1) / (his moves + 1), else if he has more moves, then
the score is -(his moves + 1) / (my moves + 1), else it is 0).

The second ratio method has the advantage that you having 2 moves and him
having 1 move is better than you having 4 moves and him having 3.
