<br>at that page you claim this about your game:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>It is an abstract game with no advantage to the first or second player.&nbsp; No
<br>game ends in a tie.&nbsp; There are no deadlocked positions, no repeating cycles.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>How is all that possible?&nbsp; If a game a win for neither player, and is not a
<br>draw either, and has no deadlock, it would seem like the only possibility
<br>remaining is infinite play.

<br>&nbsp;there is always a winner.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;when i say "no advantage to the first or second player"
<br>&nbsp;i mean that (AND i will say that i should qualify it with)
<br>&nbsp;to the best of my knowledge that the starting position of
<br>&nbsp;the game favors neither side more than the other.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;perhaps you have a way to word it that i can use?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;all games comes to a finite end because the board gets
<br>&nbsp;filled in.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;sorry if i was clumsy in the wording.
