I'd also like to mention something about why this game holds my
interest which I failed to mention when I first posted it.  The kind
of loop which is the focus of this game has a great property: it comes
in many different sizes and shapes.

Because a loop can be as small as six stones or very large, a loop can
be either a tactical or a strategic goal.  Small loops are tactical
threats and big loops are strategic threats.  This leads to nicely
varied endgames.  Some games end with tight tactical play in one area
in a battle over a bunch of forking small loop threats.  Some games
end after a long series of strategic parries, resulting in a really
big loop.  Other games end somewhere between these two.  One useful
way to think strategically about trying to form a loop is to try to
chain together a bunch of small loop threats on your way to forging
one really big loop.  Of course, there are tactical and strategic
complements to each of these ideas for the player who's trying to
prevent a loop's formation.

Because loops come in so many sizes, the feel of play is different
from that of many other connection games.  In many connection games
(Let's take Hex as a canonical example), the feeling of play is sort
of "I'm fighting to contain my opponents' aggression", whereas the
feel of Coil is more "I'm exploring a nested-doll of possible wins and
losses".  As if that makes sense.

Another itch that Coil satisfies for me:  I've long wanted to design a
connection game wherein the goal is to connect together a collection
of points within the board instead of connecting edges, as is more
traditional.  Coil ends up being that game for me: after the contract
phase is up, the player tasked with building a loop ends up trying to
forge paths between the stones from the contract to connect them into
a loop.  The feel of play for the blocking player is very different
though, and feels a little more like a traditional connection game.
This is because the the blocking player often wants to make chains of
stones that radiate towards the walls where the loop-builder can't get
around them.  I regard this as a blessing as well: because the two
sides must think so differently about their goals, there's lots of
interesting stuff to learn about to play well.  And because you don't
know which side you're going to be when the game begins, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
learn about both sides in order to be a good player.
