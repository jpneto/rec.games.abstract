Simple explanation.  Arty once objected to my using data from iggc to stir up shit.  Respecting his wishes, I started referring to iggc as Game Site X, unless it's something totally innocuous.  Mystery solved.

You're welcome.  Marvin Spellbinder hit the nail on the head in the Arimaa forum, which I was banned from once it became obvious that I wasn't there to kiss Christian's ass:

I don't have a problem with Symple, the game.  My issue is Christian's relentless, aggressive campaign to promote it year after year.  Symple the "great game".  Symple the "perfectly balanced" game.  Symple the "quintessential" game.  Then there's the brow beating, the berating of everyone for not embracing Symple.  I am tired of that.

The consensus seems to be that Symple is not a great game.  I've never heard anyone other than Christian, in all the years he's been promoting it, call Symple a great game.

Christian, I hope you don't spend the rest of your days resenting a public who doesn't appreciate how "great" Symple is, but I fear you will.  Don't be that guy.  Don't be the grumpy old man.  The public has the right to decide what it likes and what it doesn't.  You can't force Symple on them.

I'll be happy to send you a picture of Marvin.  Then you'll see he's a real person.
