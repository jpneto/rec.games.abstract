I just found out about Yinsh tournament coming up at our local game
convention (Denver). I have plaed a couple of times online, but am
still trying to form the key strategic ideas.

Any Yinsh players out there that can share key strategic and tacitcal
ideas????

Thanks
Steve

I've been playing a couple of Yinsh games, and I found out all my 
opponents were keen on the corners/edges. I'm not convinced about that 
stratey so stuborn me tried to keep my rings as mobile as possible (in 
the boards center), in stead of going to the edges. I won most of the 
games, but that doesn't say much because my Yinsh-skill is poor :-) I'de 
like to hear others' thoughts about the centre/border positions.

When I move my rings, I usually move it to a place where I would like to 
have a disc. But I also noticed that the rings are excellent for blocking 
your opponent and limit his options (I know, it's obvious, but sometimes 
it's good to think about the obvious things :-).

Cheers,
Mathijs.
