Richard Hutnik created this topic (also mentioned by fizzy) in the bgg
abstract games forum: "Would IAGO having an extended abstract strategy
games database make it a rival to BGG?"  The only reason iago would
ever have any chance of "rivaling" bgg is that Aaron Dalton is
programming iago behind the scenes.  Not because ignoramus Richard
Hutnik is out apologizing for abstract games all day.  ("The idea is
to grow all aspects of boardgaming, rather than have abstract strategy
try to take over a larger chunk of the pie.")

Can you believe the founder of the International Abstract Games
Organization even said that??  In an abstract games forum????  With
advocates like Richard Hutnik, who needs detractors?

Mark, what in your life have you don't to advance abstract strategy
games?  I have seen you tick off a lot of people, and push your
designs above the designs of others.  You happen to also ripped the
creator of the Gipf series a new one.  You got a in a feud with Ralf,
which dragged me in it.  And then, after a few years, you send me an
email saying you have burnt enough bridges, and wanted to bury the
hatchet.  At that point, you were mildly approachable, but you did
squat to help IAGO out.  I mean NOTHING.  And then, after this, what
have you done?  Well, nothing, except get a thread where BGG was
discussing helping IAGO, because you rant.

Seriously Mark, what have you done to advance abstract strategy games,
in your life?  I see a self-serving individuals who cares NOTHING
about anything then his own self-serving ends, and his ideas on what
games are supposed to be.  He goes off and yells at people on forums
and has a bloated self-importance.

Now, since you insist on bringing up ME on this forum, let's take a
look a minute at the "grow all aspects of boardgaming, rather than
have abstract strateg take over a larger chunk of the pie".  It was
written on a forum for BOARDGAMES in general.  It was meant to be
diplomatic and comes from an approach that is a win-win approach
(since you allergic to ties, maybe this is foreign to you).  Let me
lay out two approaches for you (and yes, there are two):
* Approach A: Presume that you can't get an increase in interest in
abstract strategy games, and that the interest in boardgames in
general is fixed.  The only way to get more people interest in
abstract strategy games, or one's own abstract strategy games, is to
end up fighting for it.  You need to end up elevating your own stuff,
and trash everything else.  You need to have the world see your own
brilliance and repent of the error of their ways, and then join you on
a crusade to stomp out that which doesn't meet what you find
acceptable.  In this, you need to be a warrior and constantly fight.
It is winner take all and dog eat dog.
* Approach B: Assume, by forming partnerships and alliances with a
large number of people, and negotiating roles, you can end up by a
coordinated effort, be able to grow interest in boardgames in general,
and abstract strategy games specifically.  In doing this, you may not
end up getting all the growth, but you do end up getting a piece of
it.  Everyone wins, because you are agreeable.

Mark, you have yet to demonstrate you even remotely understand
Approach B above.  You actually even fail to demonstrate this approach
among abstract strategy games period, with your attacking the Gipf
series, and anything remotely out there that sells commercially and is
noted as far as abstract strategy games go, that people actually
like.  Well Mark, guess which approach would work better for an
organization trying to promote a GENRE of games.  Do you seriously
think Approach A is going to get anyone anywhere?  Maybe you do.
Well, how well does it work for you?  Yes, you got your games in Games
Magazine, and on multiple websites.  But really, how successful has it
been?  Maybe you take solace in a belief that abstract strategy games
won't really amount to much anywhere, and you think you can be a big
fish in a small pond that you control.  But hey, maybe by acting in
such a manner, and turning off so many people, if your games still are
played, that must count for something, right?  Hey, I guess it must be
a really good game.

Anyhow, I do expect you to tell me to f'k off as you did in my email.
Hey Mark, why not keep up this airing of self-importance you have, and
presume people here actually care what you think.
