: In multi player (more than two) Abalone, what are the win/lose conditions?

The first player to push a total of 5 marbles off the board wins.
There is no second place.

:     A players loses when 5 os his marbles have been pushed off the board.

If a player has had 5 of his marbles pushed off the board, then someone
else has won.

: A secondary question is:

:     What happens to the losing players marbles?  Are they removed from

:     to defend them (with his movement)?

The games over, so the best thing to do with the losing player's
marbles is to put them back into the initial configuration and play
another game.  You're supposed to play three games anyway with each
player taking a turn at being first because of the slight advantage,
thus gained.
