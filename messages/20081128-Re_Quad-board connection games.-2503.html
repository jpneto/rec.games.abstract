FINALLY! After all the discussion slash arguments about how to handle
diagonal connections, you've finally posted what is to me, the most obvious
answer. As kids, we played this way over 35 years ago! Hex boards were to
hard to draw so we played on square graph paper using the "first come, first
connected" rule, drawing lines between diagonally connected cells. What
could be easier? When playing on a square physical board, place pieces on
the cells and mark connections with another piece on the vertex. Simple,
unambiguous, obvious. Unlike some of the other rulesets, this rule doesn't
avoid the question of "How can we play Hex on a square board?" by converting
a game on a 4-valent 4444 board to a game on a trivalent 488 board.
More importantly -- and oddly overlooked by every post on this subject I can
find -- is that the FCFC rule allows play of Hex, Y and other connection
games on ANY tessellation, regardless of how many cells meet around some of
the vertices! You can play on a triangular 666666 tiling -- that's right, on
the cells rather than the vertices. Some of the other rulesets would be
clumsy here. Try the Cairo pentagonal tiling and its dual, the 3.3.4.3.4 aka
Snub Square tiling . In fact, you can play on any of the 11 uniform tilings
AND their duals
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_planar_tilings">&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_planar_tilings&gt;</a>. -- but
there's no need to stop there -- every other tessellation will work --
non-uniform, semi-regular, irregular, non-periodic -- whatever.
(And regardless of what Mark will say -- this IS a generalization of Hex.)
