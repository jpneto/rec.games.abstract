Hi,

I like the games I see in this group. I too have created a game, and I
would like people to check it out. It's called Bubble Chamber. I have a
trial version of the game online at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cerebragames.com">http://www.cerebragames.com</a>. It is
the first four rounds of the first level, although I think I might want
to put the first four rounds of some of the other four levels to give a
better idea of what it's like.

On the site, click on the link for Bubble Chamber, and then look for
the link for the Trial Version at the bottom.

This looks like a commercial site, but it's just me, and I haven't sold
any cds yet. Let me know what you think. Thanks a lot for any input.

Jason
