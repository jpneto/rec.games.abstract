I skimmed the rules and had several questions.  (I also did a double-take

board in which each space is a square. :-)

You're right. I'll change this.

The example in figure 5 might warrant a note reminding that the move must

Writing rules is a ungrateful job, especially for abstract games which
were designed with simplicity in mind. I put the statement that "all
pieces must be connected" in bold letters in one of first paragraphs.
It's often difficult to refer to things which are explained later in
the text. But in this case I thought it's enough to be correct.

I gather from figure 6 that the ordo move is more limited than the
description makes it sound: pieces connected in a horizontal line may
only move vertically (and still only forward), and pieces connected
vertically may only move horizontally.  Otherwise the vertically
connected pair on the right could be extended into a threesome and
all three could then shift up one space.  (There'd also be a move by
the horizontal pair just below the vertical pair, which could shift
left one space.)  Figure 8 seems to say this also, but again, it says
"pieces may only move sideways" where the text above says "they may
[move] forward or sideways", and nowhere does it come out and say that
horizontal sets move only forward while vertical sets move only sideways.

I thank you for your valuable comments. I think the illustrations help
to understand the rules, but I'll definitely have to have a look at
the wording again.

Anyway, it is, as my gaming group likes to say, "not obviously a silly
game", so I'll probably try it sometime.  Thanks!

:D

Reading the rules, playing a game once, and then playing it a second
time can be very different. Try it.

Thanks.
Dieter
