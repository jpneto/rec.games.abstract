For me, I want to play boardgames which are brimming in depth, and
openness, to the point where it would be absurd to try to do an
analysis of opens/lines of play, etc...  For me, such a game would be
fresh, and be harder to master.  I wouldn't be against having some
strategy guides written, but I am against a game that speaks of
openings and set lines of play (like chess).

I can't agree with your premise that deep, open-ended games don't lend
themselves to analysis of openings and other aspects. Surely the deeper
a game is, the more likely it is to provoke such analysis.

Among the exhibits I'd produce to back up my view are some of the many
books written on Go - a game at least as deep and open-ended as the
human brain can stand.
