It's been three months since the Mind Sports Olympiad for 2007.
Nowhere on their website are any results from any of the scheduled
tournaments.

All I found were some links that gave me "404 not found" errors.

I would greatly appreciate info from anyone who attended. Were there
in fact any tournaments held at all? Was everyone abducted by aliens?
Is this one of those reality warps that Philip K. Dick wrote about?
Did whatsisface abscond with the money?
