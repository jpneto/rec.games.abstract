There is a totally awesome game invented by Douglass Hofstadter called
NOMIC where the game consists of making the rules for the game itself..

Can be VERY amusing...

or VERY syupid, depending on who plays and what kind of mood you're in.

played or saw it played. How is  it played and can you post the ground rules?

I've played some 7 or 8 years ago, it can be real fun. You can find the rules
in Scientific American (if it's the same game we're thinking about) from...
um...beginning of 80's. I could find it, I know I've got it at home.

The principle of the game is that the players takes turns proposing laws or
lawchanges. There is a Constitution and some less ridig laws, in which are
contained all information about how the game is played. These, of course, can
be changed if a majority (I think it's two-thirds majority from the start)
votes for it. You get points for having your laws accepted, but as everything
else in the game, that can be changed. The last law we made was 'The game is
suspended until we start again.' If you get the proper people, it can be
great fun, but you have to be at least five for it to be interesting.

When he turned around to look, there was nothing to be seen. Only the empty
space that had always been permeating the narrow alleys in Lower Town. He
suddenly felt frightened and very, very alone.
