People say that linear algebra is different from other undergrad math
courses because it teaches abstract thinking. I don't notice much
difference. Linear algebra has variables and matrixes but so do other math
classes. Where is the abstract thinking part of linear algebra? Why do they
make you go through Calculus before taking linear algebra? And what's the
difference between linear and normal algebra?

I have some thoughts on that since I recently completed the lower
division math courses at a two-year college.  However I am not the
typical student, since I finished high school 31 (yes 31) years ago. 
But I've thought about this question several times since I've been in
school.  At the school I'm attending Calc I and II are prerequisite
for each of Calc III, Linear Algebra, and for the separate course
Differential Equations.  I chose to take Calc III, which included
multivariable and vector calculus, before taking the Linear Algebra
and Differential Equation course at the same time.  It ended up being
a good choice in that the study of vectors in Calc III gave me an edge
in Linear Algebra, since the the ten axioms in the definition of a
vector space were very similar to the ten properties of vectors in
R^n, which were familiar to me from Calc III.  Likewise, when taking
Differential Equations, matrices and eigenvalues were not new to me
since we were covering those in Linear Algebra class.  At least a few
students seemed to have a tougher time if they didn't follow the same
path.

Aside from that specific knowledge advantage, it seemed that generally
the more practice I had doing tough problems through Calc III just
helped 'get warmed up' if you will, for what were generally tougher
courses.  The explanation I usually heard for why Linear Algebra was
more abstract, (at least in my school), is that you are expected to do
proofs for homework, and that proofs do appear on tests for the first
time.  For at least some of the students, this appeared to be their
first exposure to proofs.  You could still pass the course without
doing well at the proofs, but not get the top grade.

This semester I'm taking Physics I, and similarly I'm glad I had Calc
III. The requirement for Physics I is that Calc I be finished or being
taken concurrently.  In fact so far it is not heavy calculus. But - I
find that since I had Calc III already, in which there were a ton of
vector related concepts and problems to do, vectors are almost
becoming intuitive, and so the kinematics and dynamics problems, while
still requiring study, are at least not extremely difficult because of
the vectors. For some students, however, who may have had vectors in
high school, or in a pre-calc course, it seems more difficult. Again,
it just seems (and this is of course for me) that doing a semester of
difficult vector problems in Calc III just makes the simple vector
problems in Physics that much easier.

Likewise, I've found that high-school algebra, meaning polynomials,
systems, quadratics, etc. is again very useful in Physics. So all of
the Calc courses, where you end up doing and using a lot of
high-school algebra, just refines those skills, and you're just able
to do better on homework and on tests because you're simply not
struggling with those concepts.  I even remember an instructor made
the comment that you really don't learn algebra until you take Calc -
and I see what he meant.

In my situation I'm taking the courses one at a time because I work
full-time, but frankly for me that works well. I can really focus on
one subject at a time and have received very good grades (well in fact
the best grades).  But I suppose from a practical point of view, for
the typical, if you will, four year program, it would be difficult for
someone to wait until the second half of the sophomore year to begin
physics, for instance. And then one would be taking Physics at the
same time as Linear Algebra and Differential Equations - too much for
me. My hat is off to those who are able to pursue school full-time and
do it well!
