The 4th Annual Octi Robot Championship will take place at Yale
University again this December.  We've had fun and some fascinating
games in years past (see the game archive at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a>), and all
are welcome to join us again this year.

About OCTI

OCTI is a simple, yet deep game of strategy designed to give humans an
edge over computers. The basic premise of the game is that players
build their pieces as they play. On each turn, a player must decide
whether to move a piece, improve a piece, or add a new piece to the
board. This simple framework creates an extraordinary array of
strategic options and plays to "human" strengths: long-term planning
and heuristic reasoning. GAMES MAGAZINE named OCTI "Best Abstract
Strategy Game of the Year." For a description of the game and other
reviews, visit <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.octi.net">www.octi.net</a> .

OCTI 'Bot Tourney

Robot competitors will play a round-robin tournament.  

Competitions will be held for the following OCTI variants:

I. OCTI on a 6x7 board (see rules at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi.net/instructionfront.jpg">http://www.octi.net/instructionfront.jpg</a>): First Prize is $500

II. OCTI on a 9x9 board, playing to capture one enemy base (see rules
at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi.net/aboutocti2/images/OCTIXinst1.gif">http://www.octi.net/aboutocti2/images/OCTIXinst1.gif</a>): First Prize
is $750

III. OCTI on a 9x9 board, playing to capture all three enemy bases
(see rules at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.octi.net/aboutocti2/images/OCTIXinst2.gif">http://www.octi.net/aboutocti2/images/OCTIXinst2.gif</a>):
First Prize is $1000

Each game will be played under a two-hour time limit for each player.
Robot-designers need not be in attendance in order to compete.  For
the 9x9 games, basic rules apply (i.e., no wrap-around board, no
super-prongs).

Entrants must indicate their intent to participate by the end of
November. Contact <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:octimon@yahoo.com">octimon@yahoo.com</a> or visit
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/octiclub">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/octiclub</a>. There is no entrance fee.

Programmers may either create a graphical user interface or express
moves using official OCTI notation, so that a human moderator can
regulate games between computers. Games will be played at the Yale
StatLab on PCs running Win98 or NT, although (reasonable) requests for
other platforms and operating systems will be considered. All computer
code must be transmitted to the tournament three days prior to the
tournament, so that any operational difficulties can be worked out in
advance.

A three-judge panel will run the programs, monitor game progress,
adjudicate any rules disputes, and determine victory.
