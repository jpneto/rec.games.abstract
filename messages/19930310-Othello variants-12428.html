  A few weeks back I responded to an article about some Othello variants,
  one of which was the following game (that I came up with):
    
    Players alternate placing a disk of their color in any open space
    on the board. Each time a new piece is placed, all the other pieces
    in that same row or column get flipped.

  Well, that's not a very interesting game, since you can determine the
  final color of any piece by looking at the parity of the number of
  holes in its row and column. There is a little strategy involved in
  'unpoisining' certain squares that have an odd # of pieces in their
  row but an even # in their column, but the game is, in my (current)
  humble opinion, boring.

  BUT WAIT! - If we modify the rules slightly:
    
    When a new piece is placed on the board, pieces in the same row/column
    get flipped provided there are no blank squares between that piece
    and the new piece.

  We get a pretty interesting game! I've played it a couple times now,
  it seems to be real playable, can be played easily on an Othello board,
  etc.

  If I get some time in the next couple weeks, I'll look into the
  strategy a bit deeper....
