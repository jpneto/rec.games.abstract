Goodbye, Mark and Christian.  It's been interesting, but can't stick
around with Corey Clark attacking me at every turn.  I don't
understand it, and don't have to subject myself to it.  Maybe we will
meet up somewhere else on the net.  And Christian, I can't really
understand why you think a Corey Clark moderated group is something
you want to participate in, but wish you the best anyway.

I can't help noticing that you don't want to participate in a
moderated group yet you leave one that is not moderated. The only
control I have is over what I post, not what others post. I have a
deep faith in an even deeper truth:

"Shit happens".

I prefer to get it up front though, and this place at least lives up
to that. I've been at places where you get stabbed in the back. Not to
imply Corey's group, by the way, and I have nothing against
moderation, but everything against sanctimony.

What Taylor said was pretty asinine but I can't control that. I mean
I'm certainly not going to ban him because he thought the corners
being excluded as part of the adjoining edges was "ugly". The most I
can do is defend Havannah and tell him that I disagree. I'm doing my
part to keep the peace there but please let's not have this escalate.
I certainly wouldn't call it a deal breaker that Bill Taylor doesn't
fully appreciate Havannah.
