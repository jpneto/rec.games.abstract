One thing I forgot: There is one thing you may want to do, which the
designer Kris Burm told me he does whenever he gets a (possibly)
original idea: Mail it to yourself in a sealed envelope (you possibly
have to use a special form of postal shipment, I don't know what it's
called in English). This would not let you sue anyone successfully,
but it would at least spare you some headaches if some self-important
would-be designer is stupid enough to try to sue <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. Since
reinventions happen all the time, this is not quite as unlikely as it
sounds.

One of the reason the tradition stands that games are not directly
copyrightable, I think is this habit of reinvention. Hasbro knows that
hundreds of crackpots would sue them every time they published a new
game, if game ideas were copyrightable. Since they have a quite
successful business model without game idea copyrights anyway, they do
not push to change the established practice.
