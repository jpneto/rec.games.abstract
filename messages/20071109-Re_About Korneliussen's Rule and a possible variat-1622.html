I believe if a simple change makes a game a lot more richer
strategically, it should be considered.  I had toyed with the idea of
using a doubling cube, for example as an option for tournament play,
to add another meta-element to consider.  Some would argue that it
distracts from the purity of a game.  I would argue that the
introduction of a clock does similar, but has been shown on the
tournament level.

You are absolutely right: When chess clocks came into use, that
changed chess into another game, a game where time was an element.
That was a huge modification: suddenly, chess had another winning
condition besides checkmate! Yet it became accepted. The pie rule to
Hex was in fact a less radical change: It only introduced some new
strategical considerations at the beginning, but you still had to win
in the regular way. (I'm not saying people aren't playing Hex with a
clock, by the way)

If your time shaving rule was used, people would have to learn to
evaluate various starting positions - but they more or less have to,
anyway. They would also have to adjust their playing style to the time
they have at disposition - but chess players are very used to that
already. In addition, Fisher Chess is, I think, mostly balanced in
practice, so there would be very little to gain. I'm guessing most  of
the time, players wouldn't bother offering a time handicap (except
perhaps to balance up the advantage of white?), and they would just
choose sides randomly, since that also balances the game in the long
run, no matter what tricks the "splitter" tries.
