But even if you did see all the upcoming tile shapes and where and when
they will appear, Tetris is still a puzzle not a game. Abstract games are
between two or more players.

What if one player chose the shapes, and the other placed them?
That also eliminates the random and/or incomplete information
elements.  You might have to add some restrictions about re-use
of elements to avoid some sort of "obvious best strategy".

Hm.  How about a two-player game in which both players have
boards, and a turn consists of one player choosing a pair of
shapes, then the other player taking one of the pair and giving
the other to the first player, then each player fits the shape
onto their board per the computer-game rules?  Since there are
(I think) seven Tetris shapes (reflections count as different)
so 21 pairs of different shapes.  The players could alternate
which player chooses and which divides, until each pair has
been chosen once, then bring all 21 pairs back and continue.

Not having played a lot of Tetris, I have no idea if there's a
real game in here...
