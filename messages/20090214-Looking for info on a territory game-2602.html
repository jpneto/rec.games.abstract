A mate was trying to describe to me a game he used to play. I was 
wondering what it was called, and after more info about it. 

It's played on a square grid. You take turns selecting a vertex.
If your vertex completes a connected loop of vertices of your colour, 
where connections can be diagonal or along the edges of the square 
grid, then every vertex inside that loop becomes yours too. (Including
previously captured loops that your opponent has made.) The winner 
is the player with the largest total territory at the end of the game.

I tried the Vista speech recognition by running the tutorial. I was 
amazed, it was awesome, recognised every word I said. Then I said the 
wrong word ... and it typed the right one. It was actually just 
detecting a sound and printing the expected word! -- pbhj on /.
