   It sounds like you're trying for a mechanism something like what the game
Diplomacy has in it.  In Diplomacy, though, there's something a bit more
concrete to tie one's guesses about what another play will do to.  In your
game, as described, the ONLY thing you have to base your decision about
whether or not to support another player's proposal on is what that player
says about it.  My concern would be that this will lead the game to be
shallow, degenerating into a simple "guess who's lying this turn" contest.
It does have a certain elegant purity to it, if you simply want to analyze
prisoner's dilemma issues, alliance &amp; betrayal patterns, etc.  My experience
as a designer has been that serious gamers will give some "excercise" to such
mechanisms in a game - but most people will not form alliances in games where
it would clearly be advantageous to do so, simply playing "every man for
himself".  I remember one married couple who would always attack each other
last in any game.  Gaming is a social, rather than intellectual excercise for
most people.  Not that the intellectual side isn't worth studying, amongst
those that do play games that way.  One last comment - I think the game as
currently defined will be extremely difficult to create a good computer
player for.
