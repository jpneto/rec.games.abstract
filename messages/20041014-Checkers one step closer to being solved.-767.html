<div class="moz-text-flowed">I know this comes up regularly, but I don't think it has for a while.
<br>
<br>There's an 8/2/04 posting on the Chinook site ( 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/">http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/</a> ) that says they've solved one 
opening and it's a draw.&nbsp; The opening is called the White Doctor: 10-14 
22-18 12-16.
<br>
<br>A practical implication of this is that this opening should be removed 
from the three-move restriction tournament ballots, if in fact it's 
currently in them.&nbsp; I don't know whether it is or not.
<br>
<br>They expect to be solving the other openings more quickly now that this 
one has been solved.
<br>
<br>Another interesting this is that the number of three-move restriction 
openings is smaller than the total number of openings because some 
openings are disallowed, so this makes the problem of solving checkers 
somewhat easier, at least under three-move restriction tournament rules.
