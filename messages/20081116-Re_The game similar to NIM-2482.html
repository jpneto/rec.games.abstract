I have to consider the following game:
all rules are the same like in classic 'nim' game except one rule -
the number of stones in heaps are nondecreasing (e.g. (1,2,2,6,7),
not (5,1,7)). After every move this rule must be keep. So player can
remove stones from heap X only and only if in heap to the left are
less piles and he can't remove more stones, than difference between
heap X and heap to the left.

This is indeed "The Silver Dollar game, without the dollar" from
J H Conway's "On Numbers and Games", except that he considers the
game in which the heaps (which are modeled by coin positions) are
strictly decreasing.  As before, the largest heap and every second
heap from there down is treated as a Nim heap whose size is the number
of its options, and moves to the other heaps are reversible.

The mis¨¨re case also works exactly as in mis¨¨re Nim.  If the winner is
forced to move in the ignored heaps, the best move is to remove one
token, leaving the opponent with only one nonreversible move.
Eventually, the nonreversible move will be the last move, losing the
game.
