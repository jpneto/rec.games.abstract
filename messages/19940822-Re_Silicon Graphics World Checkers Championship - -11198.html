Since Tinsley resigned the match due to ill health, and since the Chinook

There is one problem with this logic.  There are two World Championships,
the human Championship (currently vacant, the person who was awarded it
after Tinsley giving up the title two years back died recently), and the
Man-Machine World Champion, which is specifically created for this event
by the Checkers Association.  Chinook has a better claim to the latter
title, as it was the challenger in the aborted match, not Lafferty.

Lafferty holds no current world title.
