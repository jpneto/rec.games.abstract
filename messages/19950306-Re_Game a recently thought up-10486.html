: &gt;While playing around the other day, I came up with a simple game that
: &gt;looks possibly interesting.  Has anyone seen this before, or is it
: &gt;new?  Assuming it's not new, is the strategy non-trivial.  Playing
: &gt;around with it seems to indicate that it might not be.
: &gt;
: &gt;Rules:
: &gt;
: &gt;Lay out a NxN grid of points: N=5 seems to work well.  Place an X in
: &gt;one corner between four points, an O in the opposite corner.
: &gt;
: &gt;. . . . .
:  X
: &gt;. . . . .

: &gt;. . . . .

: &gt;. . . . .
: &gt;       O
: &gt;. . . . .

: &gt;The board can be thought of both as an NxN set of grid points, or a
: &gt;(N-1)x(N-1) set of squares.  The tokens sit in the squares, walls are
: &gt;built between grid points.
: &gt;
: &gt;Players alternate turns.  On a players turn, they may either move
: &gt;their token or build a wall
: &gt;
: &gt;A token (X or O) may move one square horizontally or vertically.  The
: &gt;token may not move onto the other token, and may not cross a wall.
: &gt;The board is periodic: motion off the board places the token on the
: &gt;opposite side. Moving off the board to the left places the
: &gt;token on the right in the same row, for example. 
: &gt;
: &gt;A wall may be built between any two grid points: once built, it may
: &gt;not be destroyed.  Walls block movement by both tokens.
: &gt;
: &gt;The first player to have their token surrounded by four adjacent walls
: &gt;loses: the game is a draw if placing a wall captures both tokens at
: &gt;the same time.

: As I read this the first player has an easy win.  Lets say I go first
: and I am X.  I place a wall above the O.  If O does not move (to
: the side), I place a wall to the side of O (trapping it), my next two
: turns I place the other walls and win.  So O goes to the side, I
: place a wall above it, O must move futher to the side, pretty soon
: it is walled in anyway and I win.

There seem to be two ways of solving this problem:

1)  Play on a larger board and do NOT start the players on an edge or in
a corner.

2)  Allow first player a move or wall placement and then the second
player is allowed both a move and a wall placement.  Each succeeding
turn both players may do both.  (Use a larger board as well)

This game reminds me of one in a series of board games put out by TSR about
10 years ago.  I think it was called "Kage".  Basically each player had
a square for their token and placed little green walls on the edges of
the squares.  I've never played it, but it did look similar.  I've seen
it occasionally at Kaybee Toys in the Clearance shelf, but that hasn't
been for a while.

I don't like disclaimers, but I have to put them in.  The opinions here
are my own and not necessarily PG&amp;E's.
(As if it had any opinions about this stuff!)
