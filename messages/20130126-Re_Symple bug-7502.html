Hear, hear.  Subjecting the players to an exhaustive stone counting ritual when the game should already be over is Geringesque.

Play on a physical board is a big concern for me.  All of my games are designed primarily for real world play.  Computer play is secondary.

Not to me.  That's the world's second ugliest rule, exceeded only by superko.  Better to just let Symple's essential draw susceptibility prevail.

The game designers like Markrappy and Schakovitz (Corey Clarkrappy seems to be ashamed to put his name)  are really dumb.

Only purely random game is non-cyclic.
Any game no matter the time you waste on to design it is cyclic-game.
Any game is draw when you consider 2 games instead of one (either is first-player win or second player win).
YOU ARE DUMB!

A game is good if and only if any of the players has something to achieve. I mean there is always something challenging on the game for both players.
Cephalopod is a bad game because there is nothing challenging in it.
You can play it at most 4 times not more and you throw it on the garbage.
Nothing is surprising on this crappy game.
Just try to play the game on 2x2 board without thinking to the result and you will see that game in fact is cyclic. The same pattern is repeating itself over and over.
My conclusion is valid for all the "connection" games.
Ayu is an original game. If Luis find more sophisticated blocking system to challenge your opponent I think that his game will soon be popular.

Slither is not even a game.
It is a botched game. A monstruous game designed for dumbs monkeys and donkeys.
