This is a variant of Mark Steere's new game "Atoll".
. . .
The winning criterion is almost identical to that of "Y",
except that the Y criterion is specifically adapted to
figures with an ODD number of sides, (Y has 3, but
variants with 5, 7 etc are simple).  Atoll, however,
is specifically adapted to boards with an EVEN number.

Mark is to be strongly congratulated on discovering
the natural criterion for even-sided boards!

Bill, you seem to have stopped short of fully generalizing Atoll's
central, defining principle.  It's not just a question of how many
sides a board has.  It's also a question of how many segments a
board's perimeter is divided into.

In both Atoll and Hexatoll each side is divided into two segments, but
there's no reason to stop there.  In both cases the sides could be
further divided into 4 segments or 6 segments, and so on.  Generally
speaking, Atoll can be played on any even sided board with any even
number of perimeter segments (8 or higher).

Hex-grid connection games like Hex, Y and Atoll can be defined by the
following properties:

 0. Two players play.

 1. The board consists of a set of connected hexes, some of which may
    be pre-coloured to one of the player colours.

 2. A move consist of adding a piece of the player's colour to a hex
    on the board.

 3. Winning is achieved by connecting a specified subset of hexes on
    the board by pieces of the player's colour.

 4. A completely filled board will fulfill the criteria for <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>exactly<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
    one side.

Note that it is not possible for two paths of opposing colours to
cross.  This is true because only three hexes meet in a point, so
there is no way for two paths to cross at a point (and if two paths
cross, there must be such a point).

On a filled board, consider two touching groups of opposite colours.
The border between these must either be a closed loop or it is open,
which means that both ends of the border touches the edge of be board
in a place where two colours meet.

A border that is a closed loop means that the enclosed group doesn't
touch the edge of the board.  It may, however, enclose one or more of
the precoloured groups.  If it doesn't we can ignore the group (e.g.,
by replacing it with the enclosing colour), as it doesn't contribute
to the winning criterion.

A border that isn't a closed loop will touch the edge in two places
where the edge changes colour.

In Hex, only edges are pre-coloured, so we can ignore enclosed groups
(filling them with the enclosing colour).  The remaining borders must
end in the corners, as those are the only places where the edge
changes colour.  Hence, there are exactly two borders, so there must
be exactly three groups (the number of borders is one less than the
number of groups).  That can only happen if two same-coloured edges
are in one group and the two other edges are in diffrent groups.

We can use this principle on boards of all shapes and sizes.

Let us look at a singly connected set of hexes (i.e., a polygon
without holes) and divide its edge into sections.  We now assume that
the winning criterion is about connecting one of several specified
subsets of edge sections.

We must now find a winning criterion that is achieved by exactly one
of the groups.

The "at most one" part is achieved if we for any border between two
groups that divide the board into two parts have: If one part is
filled entirely by one colour and the other part by the other colour,
only one of these is a winning configuration.

Proof: Let us assume we have a group fulfilling the winning criteria.
The part of the board on the other side of any one of its borders can
not contain a winning configuration of the other colour, so both sides
can't have a winning configuration.

This does not get us the "at least one" part.  To do this, we need: If
we have group in a winning configuration and replace part of this
group by a non-winning group of the opposite colour (that does not
touch existing groups of that colour), the group is still winning.

Proof: Let us assume there a filled board has no winning group.

We know that filling the whole board with one colour will make that
colour win, so we by the above property we can add in all the
non-winning groups of the opposing colour and still remain with a
winning configuration.  But by adding in all the opposite-coloured
groups. we have reconstructed the board which we assumed had no
winning configuration.  This is a contradiction, so our assumptiom
must be wrong.


Let us apply these principles to known games.

In Y, any border will touch at most two edges, so the untouched edge
will be on one side of the border only.  So the other side can not
hold a winning configuration.  Let us assume that we have a group that
connects three edges.  If we from that group subtract a group that
touches at most two edges, we will still retain a group that connects
three edges.  Proof: The subtracted group is either completely
enclosed by the original group, which doesn't change the connectivity
of the original group, or the border between the two group touches the
edges of the triangle at two edges.  These edges will be part of both
groups (as both sides of the border belong to the same edge), so it is
only the third edge that can be a problem.  But if this is taken away
from the original group, the taken-away group will connect all three
sides, which contradicts the assumption that the subtracted group is
not winning.

Note that this depends on the corners being part of both edges.

In generalised Atoll, there is 4N alternating black and white edge
sections (separated by at most one uncoloured hex, which would touch
both sections) and the purpose is to connect any two opposing sections
(i.e., at distance 2N) that have the same colour as the player.

If we have a border that divides the board into two parts, then if one
side connects two opposing black segments, the other can not connect
two opposing white segments, and vice-versa.  This is fairly easy to
see.

If we have a winning configuration for black, replacing part of this
by a white group that doesn't touch existing groups means that the new
group is bordered only by the original group and the edge of the
board.  An enclosed group doesn't change connectivity, so we can
ignore this.  If the new group touches the edge, we are fine as long
as it does not completely block one of the opposing black sections.
But to completely block a black section, the new white group must
touch something white, which we don't allow.

Note that we have not considered the shape of the board except that it
has no holes.  This makes it include Hex (if N=1).

As can be seen, the criteria are fairly easy to use.
