Flume is similar to Dots and Boxes in this respect, though I personally
don't know of any other "dots-n-boxes games" - not that I doubt their
existence.

 From the 1000 year contest: "Elegance: Entries should be easy to learn,
teach and play. We favor entries that can be explained succinctly and played
in under an hour."

The choice between Flume and Oust as contest entries was a tough one.  Oust
is harder to learn though.  If you look at the two rule sheets, Flume can be
explained in half a page, with the bottom half being used for example moves.

Flume:

Oust:

More people had trouble understanding Oust than Flume, though a lot of
people had trouble with the Flume rule sheet too.

Yes, the opening play in Flume is "random" in a sense.  You're just laying
down stones, setting up the board in preparation for the "thinking" phase,
which only lasts for a few turns.

A "randomized" opening followed by a short but intense thought period makes
for a short game <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>with negligible turn order advantage<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>.  You've got a game
of (essentially) 30-35 turns with no more turn order advantage than many 60+
turn games.
