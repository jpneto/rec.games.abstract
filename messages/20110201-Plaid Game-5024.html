(Crappy game # 2)

I saw this game in a dream recently. I suggest it is played on a
computer, because it involves summing up many lengths to get the
scores.

This game is for any plural number of players.

Start with a blank rectangular, preferably square, piece of paper (or
computer-simulation of a piece of paper*).

Take turns. On a move, a player draws either a horizontal or a
vertical straight line from one side of the paper to the opposite
side.

After a predetermined number of lines are drawn, the game ends after
the next multiple of n number of rectangles have been drawn on the
paper, where n is the number of players.
(So: If v is the number of vertical lines, and h is the number of
horizontal lines, then (v+1)*(h+1) is divisible by n.)

Player k gets as a score the sum of the lengths of the diagonals of
each rectangle occurring at position k in every block of n rectangles,
if the rectangles were to be laid out from left to right, each row
after the previous in the sequence of rectangles.

So, if h = 8 and v = 7 and n = 3, say, and r(x,y) = the rectangle at
position x,y, then player 2 would get the sum of the diagonals of:
r(2,1), r(5,1), r(8,1) (the rightmost rectangle on the top row),
r(3,2), r(6,2), r(1,3),... etc.

Largest score wins.

*PS: If this game is played on a computer, then there will be an
underlying large-resolution grid that every line conforms to. The
number of grid-lines in this computer grid should be known by the
players, since I think the value would be a factor in some strategies
(because a maximum number of lines could be drawn between any two
lines).

Thanks,
Leroy Quet
