Actually a simple board game, but on the other hand a mixture
of a cellular automaton, manqala , chinese and hindoo mysticism
and boolean arithmetics.

However this is just an idea and has not yet been tested in reality
as far as I know.

The basic settings are a board with 16 fields and eight type of
species,
being 000,001,010,011,100,101,110 and 111.

The field is first populated with the empty or neutral species 000.
Then each of the two players can put four animals on four different
fields of the board , one after another.

So after each player has put his animals on the board the board might
look somewhat like this:

   000 010 000 011 100 000 101 000 111 110 011 000 000 000 101 000

Each species can jump a certain amount of fields in just one direction.

On collision the two species melt and form another species,
which is actually one of those eight.

The species are given a time for playing or evolution of let say
a certain time of n generation, with n being let's say something
like twelve generation or so. I like to call this time a yuga.

After that it is time for an avatar or in other words the players
simultaniously can change the species on one field.
This should be done simultanously so that the second player
can not base his decision on the decision of the first player.

This way goes on for a predefined number of yugas or generations
(using the cellular automaton slang).

Then the player with his favourite species predominating the board
wins.


However I have no idea on what to base the computer strategy.

Suggestions for coming version

- infinite number of species
- the species can jump in two directions and which is decided
  by randomness (chaotic approach) or neighbours
- growing board or universe
- developing or upcoming evolutionary developed new rules
  during the game 
- infinite madness :-)
