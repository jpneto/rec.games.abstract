|&gt; Simplified go-moku (symmetric rules; no restrictions on forks or overruns;
|&gt; infinite board; winning position is n stones in a row) is a first-player win
|&gt; for n=5, and a draw for n=7 (I don't think n=6 has been solved yet).  What
|&gt; is known about 1-2-2-... multimove go-moku for various values of n?

Are you quite sure about this for n=7 ?  I checked out the references given
in "Winning Ways"; which give the then known cases as follows:

for n=9: there is a straightforward proof of a draw, (actually given in WW);
for n=8: referenced Zetters gives a similar but more complex proof of draw;
for n=7: Zetters' proof half-extends to this case, but NOT yet fully, so far
         as I know.    Do you have more recent info on this ?

(The sense in which Zetters half-proves it is this: he proves there is a draw
in the game where you must get an orthogonal 7 or a diagonal 8 to win.)

And as was shown at a recent computer game demonstration, the case
for n=5: is now known to be a win.  (Like you, I've no clue on n=6 !)

For 1-2-2-2-... multi-move go-moku, all I know is the results of my own
slim manual efforts:  1st wins for n=1,3,5; 2nd wins for n=2,4; it is easily
proved a draw for n=13, and probably for n=12.

For 1-2-3-4-... (progressive) go-moku, I have...

n:      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 ...
winner: 1  2  1  1  2  1  1  2  1 ...   ...(there can be no draws, of course).
on move:1  2  3  3  4  5  5  6  7 ...    

Corrections or extensions would be most welcome.

I also spend some time looking at the  1-3-4-4-4-4-... multimover.  
The motivation for this is to smooth off the slight apparent advanatage that
remains to 1st-mover from the 1-2-2-2-... mutimover. This apparent advantage
arises from the fact that initially "1st" is a move ahead, then "2nd" is a
move ahead, then "1st" again, then "2nd" again, etc.  Thus if the game is
viewed at some random distant time after the start, there is perhaps <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>slightly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
more of a chance that it will be "1st" who is the move ahead. (This is a very
vague argument to which I attatch little real importance.  I have never <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>had<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
a 1-3-4-4-  game of anything, but I like to analyze them.)  The 1-3-4-4- mm
gives 1-2-2-2- as the number of moves each is ahead at any given time, so seems
just slightly fairer. (Again, I ignore the obvious higher-order iterations !)

For the 1-3-4-4-4.. multimover for go-moku I get...

n:       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  ...
winner:  1  2  2  1  1  2  1? ... 


Again, the progressive multimover is subject to the same slight nitpick of
2nd-order unfairness as the 1-2-2-2- . To account for this, so as to produce
progressiveness in the number-of-moves-ahead, we need the "ODD PROGRESSIVE"
multi-mover, 1-3-5-7-9-...   Again, I have never played a game of this, but
analysis (or common sense) shows things happen very fast, and I think it
would be fun to play go-moku or go with this multimover.

For go-moku I get...

n:      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 ...
winner: 1  2  2  1  1  1  2  2  2 ...

As before, corrections or extensions are welcome.

As Karl said, the go-moku referred to is always ideal/simplified:- infinite
board, no restrictions on multiple attacks or overlines.
