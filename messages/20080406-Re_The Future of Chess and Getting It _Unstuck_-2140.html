When they brought in the

I agree 100%. There really are no short-cuts here: even if Richard
Hutnik's evolutionary chess programme is perfect, and even if he would
have proposed the same even if it didn't have his or his
organization's name on it... this is something Chess players will have
to deal with on their own, without outside intervention.

Only reason why IAGO is attached to it, is that it has stemmed from an
issue of wanting to have a variant of chess using Capablanca pieces
being played, but not able to find any acceptable version.  The end
result was a larger framework to think on, that is my interest to have
IAGO cover.  Think of it a bit like FIDE chess, but open to variants.
And no, it isn't perfect, but the approach is to have consensus
reached to what works best, and frame chess in such that it can have a
version operating that is being tested on the tournament level before
the slow adapting version changes.  Of course, to this part, the
proposal is getting Capablanca pieces on an 8x8 board, but even this
would be up for change.  The fact IAGO is involved here, is merely
just to stimulate things.  If no one picks it up and runs with it, so
be it.  It isn't going anywhere.

The approach is to acknowledge chess as an evolutionary design and
allow for it to keep evolving over time, rather than get codified.  It
is also meant as a way to integrate variants into the mix as a valid
form of chess, and a way to get ideas to revitalize chess.  The ideas
would work in a lot of areas.  And in way is this supposed to be one
person, myself or anyone else trying to ramrod anything down the chess
community.  Mostly, it acknowledges what will happen anyhow, but just
makes it more conscious.
