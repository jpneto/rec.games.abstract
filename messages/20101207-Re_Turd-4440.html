Good point, Christian.  Mirroring is a source of trouble in games like
Amazons with too much symmetry.  Dipole has the same problem.

There are mirror-countering schemes in both games.  In Amazons for example
Player 1 (White) can move onto the main diagonal and shoot an arrow along
the main diagonal, crossing the center point of the board.  Black can't
mirror that.  But that's only in the opening game.  A symmetric position can
arise unexpectedly (for at least one of the players) at some point in the
game where there are not any such mirror-defeating moves available.  Then
it's an automatic win for one of the players.

I hate mirroring.  There has to at least be a counter-mirroring scheme
available.

For stone placement games on odd sized boards, Player 1 can mirror Player 2
after first moving to the center point of the board.  This can be simply
countered by invoking the pie rule.

I think the pie rule should be assumed to be an unwritten part of any game
that it can be.  If it isn't needed, it isn't used.  It sure isn't hurting
anything.  If Player 1 is greedy with his initial move selection, I believe
Player 2 is well within his rights to say, "I'll take that.  Thanks for
making such a good first move for me."
