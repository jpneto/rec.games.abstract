Rofl Clark!  Your site is dead!  Nobody is posting there!!  People just made

rofl, the site is hardly dead. We set up a whole contest there. It
seems that people don't have much to say about abstract games is all.
I mean it's not like anyone but a very sore Christian Freeling is
saying anything about abstract games here. Nobody was quite as upset
about Bill's "belligerent" statement as Christian Freeling.

Ohhh, I get it.  Seeing a forum with no quality control incites you to
become "belligerent and immature".  Yes, it's all beginning to make sense
now.

It should make sense, that seems to have been your response.

OH MY GODDD!!!!  ARE YOU STILL BEATING THE "NOBODY POST ABSTRACT GAME

Yeah and I know once the tidbits series came out that was pretty much
it, besides a faint whisper every now and again the only things being
posted were your stupid ass rants.

OH SURE!!  LET ME RUN TO YOUR SITE, WHERE YOU'VE ALREADY DELETED A BUNCH OF
POSTS, INCLUDING CHRISTIAN FREELING'S FOR DARING TO EXPRESS DISSATISFACTION.
 I CAN'T WAIT TO BE MODERATED BY ADMITTED "BELLIGERENT AND IMMATURE" IDIOT,
COREY CLARK!!

lol I deleted his post that did nothing but escalate a disagreement
with Bill Taylor. It was ridiculous actually. Leaving Shangri La, give
me a break. Unlike Omar Syed, I have the balls to erase bullshit from
my forum.

I can't say that the upshot of moving everyone over to the new forum

CLARK!!  YOU HAVEN'T "MOVED" ANYBODY!!!!  EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU'VE NAMED
IN YOUR "EXODUS" HAS CONTINUED TO POST HERE AT REC.GAMES.ABSTRACT,
UNABATED!!!!  NONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU "MOVED" CONTINUE TO POST IN YOUR STUPID
FORUM!!!!

rofl I moved everyone except those who wouldn't be moved from being
firmly cemented in their ivory towers. Everyone else migrated to the
promised land. Yes there have been odd postings from former users
here, does that prove your point? Let's see, Nick Bentley comes in
here to chastise you in the only way Nick Bentley knows how, politely.
Bill Taylor is/was here like myself to troll you. Harald basically
came in here to say something to the effect of "hey, you're an
asshole". Yep, that's everybody, guess I'll have to give you that
one...

sorry but no that's wishful thinking.
