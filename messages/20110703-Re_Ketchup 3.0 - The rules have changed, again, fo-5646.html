I lately discovered how to make Ketchup, one of my best games, better.
So now I'm posting my second major revision in as many years. First
I'll describe the new rules, such as they are, and then discuss why
Ketchup warms my pants and why I'm so happy about the new version.
Here we go:

Ketchup is a game for 2 players played with red and green stones on a
hexhex5 board.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I like it. Does a 7-wide game make a deeper game, or just a longer one?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In my experience larger boards don't add anything. Maybe they would
for really experienced players, but for me, the game is more boring on
larger boards.  In fact, it might be even better on boards smaller
than hexhex5. Bill Taylor has been playing a ketchup-like game on
Hexhex3 and says it works well, though that's a bit small for me.  I
might end up believing that the game is best on hexhex4, but I don't
have much experience on that size so I'll withhold judgement for now.

If your first or 2nd stone creates your first group of size greater
than 1, and your opponent already has even bigger groups, do you get
to play a 3rd stone?

I.e., looking at it another way, are the drops all simultanious?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Yes, all drops are made on your turn <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>before<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> their consequences come
into effect. So, in your example, you <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>do<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> get to play the third
stone.  Perhaps I should think about how to make that clear in the
rules.
