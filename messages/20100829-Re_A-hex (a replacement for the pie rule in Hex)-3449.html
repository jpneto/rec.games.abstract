In all seriousness, I believe this guy is a true, textbook

Mark I was just trying to get 1 game.

I know.  You were trying to force me to play against you by
sleeplessly monitoring iggc for a period of days and instantly joining
every challenge I posted.  That's why you're a psychopath.

To be honest Mark, Hex Oust is quickly becoming my
favorite game. How awkward is it for me to look at Mark Steere as a
source of inspiration, when the guy hates my guts?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't hate your guts.  I simply won't play you at any game, as I've
made abundantly clear for weeks.  I was already committed to never
playing you again before your recent stunt blocking me out of iggc.
Remember my post in this topic way back on August 13, 2010?  "[Corey
Clark a.k.a. Liberte was] ingratiating himself in the hopes that I'll
grant him private audience - something that won't happen again."

Even a nice "fuck off" would've helped me understand what was
going on.

The readership thinks you're being facetious.  They don't understand
that you really are encouraged by what would normally be considered
discouraging remarks such as "fuck off".  Again, this is why you're a
psychopath.

I think this transcends a simple internet dispute.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't think so.  This discussion isn't even a dispute.  What's your
claim, that you have the right to play against me, and that if you
can't, nobody else can?  What a psychotic asshole!
