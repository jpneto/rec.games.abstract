This reminded me of Footsteps, which has apparently been marketed as Quo Vadis.

The board is as below:

The two players A and B sit at opposite ends of the row.  At the start of
the game a token is placed in the central square, and each player starts
off with 50 points.

At each move both player writes down the number of points to expend on
that move.  The player who wrote the highest number moves the token
one space towards (him|her)self, and both players subtract the number
of points from the current total.

The aim of the game is to get the token to the square closest to you.
If one player runs out of points, the other can keep making moves.
If both players run out, then a draw or half victory can be declared.

The game can obviously be varied by changing the number of squares
and starting points.
