I'm not done with you yet, Taylor.  Doesn't seem like you're accepting
responsibility for your actions here.  How dare you put on this grotesque
display of wallowing self pity for the readership of rec.games.abstract?? 
Reason given for tearful departure: "Despicable acts by Mark the Destroyer".

The despicable act here was a university professor trying to shut down a
public, academic forum, Wallowing Willy!  Beyond despicable, it's
unbelievable!!  If me tipping off your colleagues to your already very
public act of belligerence seems despicable to you, then maybe you shouldn't
have tried to shut down a public, academic forum, Wallowing Willy!!!!

Fuck off.

Ohhhh, so the "crackpot" complaints of Mark the Destroyer had to be
"investigated", did they? lol  Taylor, do you know how many university
professors have to be "investigated" for allegations of wanton belligerence?


(not very many)

And that's really what this was, Taylor.  Just straight-up, wanton
belligerence.  You could have just started your own group.  There was no
rational reason to additionally try to shut down my group (or Christian's
group, or whoever really owns rec.games.abstract now).  Just wanton
belligerence.
