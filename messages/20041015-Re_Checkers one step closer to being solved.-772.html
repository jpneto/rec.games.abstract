<br>Here's a few other European checkers/draughts variants named for various 
countries just to confuse matters further. Although I'm not sure if they 
actually originated in these countries, or are merely named for them. I 
like to say that games are like languages -they have dialects and change 
as they go from place to place.
<br>
<br>Italian Checkers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions from standard British, or American Checkers:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players must capture opposing pieces whenever possible, or forfeit the 
game.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only kings can capture kings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a choice of possible jumps, the player must take a king 
rather than a single piece.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players must also jump the maximum number of pieces possible, as well 
as the most powerful pieces (again, jumping kings rather than men).
<br>---------
<br>
<br>Spanish Checkers
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played as Italian checkers, with these exceptions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a choice of captures, the player must take the option which 
takes the maximum number of opposing pieces.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings may move any number of spaces along open diagonals, and they can 
capture by jumping an opposing piece to land any number of diagonal 
spaces away.
<br>
<br>
<br>German Checkers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played as Spanish Checkers, except:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men can make jumps backwards, or forwards, but otherwise can only move 
forward as in standard Checkers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece is crowned only if the move lands and stops on the opponents 
edge row of squares. If there are additional jumps that are possible 
that would take the piece away from the edge, it must take the jumps 
immediately -without- being crowned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings may move any number of spaces along open diagonals, and they can 
capture by jumping an opposing piece to land any number of diagonal 
spaces away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players must capture opposing pieces whenever possible, or forfeit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only kings can capture kings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a choice of possible jumps, the player must take a king 
rather than a single piece.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players must jump the maximum number of pieces possible, as well as the 
most powerful pieces (again, jumping kings rather than men).
<br>
<br>
<br>Russian Checkers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This variant is like German checkers in that men can jump opposing 
pieces either forwards, or backwards, however:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A player with a choice of jumps is not required to take the larger 
number of pieces.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man reaching the far row is crowned, and then may continue to make 
any additional possible jumps as part of the same move.
<br>
<br>
<br>Irish Draughts
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll a single die and you must move a single piece the number of spaces 
indcated by the dice. If you don't have enough room to move that far you 
lose a turn.
