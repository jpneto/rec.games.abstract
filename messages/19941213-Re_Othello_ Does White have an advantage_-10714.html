The 1993 Waterloo CSC Computer Othello Tournament Final had six programs 
which were all fairly even in terms of performance.  White took 25.5 out of 
30 possible points in the round robin event.

So, I pose the question:  Does White have the advantage in a game of Othello?
Or does Black receive enough of an edge to destroy the usefulness of White's 
last move?

Recently there have been many claims about opening advantage in Othello,
including many people who have claimed that white should win if all else
is equal.  While there have been some startling results (most notably the
tournament mentioned above), I believe there is no solid evidence that
white has an advantage.

Let's look at recent Othello games between knowledgeable opponents.  I loaded
games from THOR's database over the past two years (the most which would fit
into memory at once), and of the 4518 games, black won 50.1% to white's 49.9%.
Certainly there's no indication there of any bias one way or another.

Some would argue that since most of the games in the above sample are between
humans, many errors were made in endgame which could have affected many of
the outcomes.  THOR has a handy feature which displays the outcome had the
endgame been played perfectly from a certain point.  Checking the results
in this case, we find indeed that black wins 51.9% to white's 48.1%! 
Assuming that black and white have an equal probability of winning, we'd
expect a sample of this size to be normally distributed with a mean of 2259
and a variance of about 33.  In fact, black won almost 86 more games than 
expected, or more than 2 standard deviations greater than would have been
expected!  This would seem to clash with our model, and even more so with a
model which predicts a white win ...

Perhaps the problem is that humans play too poorly, so the advantage for
white only comes out at top-level play.  And perhaps computers are the
best players in the world (as an aside, there has been no convincing
proof of this although most are of the opinion that the world's best 
computers have surpassed the top humans).  So for a trend we should look
at computer tournaments.  The one mentioned above does look very much
like white has an advantage ... I decided to examine the results of other
double-round-robin tournaments to see if they exhibit the same trend.

The second IOS tournament was a double-round-robin between 7 top programs,
and when the dust had cleared black had won 21 games, white 18,
with 3 draws.  The third IOS tournament is another double-round-robin event
between different programs, and with 4 games remaining the current
results are black 16, white 19, with 3 draws.  Certainly there's no
apparent edge for either colour there.

Finally, I analyzed black and white winning percentages between top programs
among the first 30,000 games played on IOS.  The results showed that among
programs who have played a significant number of games, most of the top ones
in terms of IOS rating had nearly equal black and white winning percentages.
Some programs exhibited a slight preference for white, while others favoured
white strongly (Mark's program, Keyano, showed the strongest preference for
white).

My personal experience has been that until quite recently (with the advent
of Logistello, in my view the strongest Othello-playing program ever by
quite some margin) most programs play a waiting-game, playing solid and
good moves which will lead to a slow erosion in a weaker player's position.
If two such similar programs face off, things should continue along until
at the end of the game, as white gets the last move he will end up with a
few more discs than black in the long run.  This has been the pattern in
many games I've watched between very good programs.  Logistello and top
humans, however, seem to have the ability to unearth unusual moves which
look bad at first, but several moves later lead to a very good position. 
Logistello displays almost no bias at all based on its games played (of
which there are a very substantial number), and I've seen no particular
bias among large samples of top human games either.

I believe this debate will continue for a good deal of time to come.  It
is interesting to examine the game for bias, and occasionally it seems
like one side or the other may have the edge.  However I don't see nearly
enough evidence to proclaim Othello a win for white ... this interesting
debate should continue for some time to come ...
