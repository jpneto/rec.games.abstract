Hi,
Before I plop down &gt; 100 euros on it, I was wondering what others
thought about Lhote's "Histoire des Jeux de Societe"?  How does it
compare to Murray's "History of Board Games other than Chess" or
Parlett's "Oxford History of Board Games"?

I am interested primarily in traditional abstracts, and would like a
bit more history than is in those references, which can be a bit
disappointing at times.  I think a good book on the subject should
trade away some of the cataloging in exchange for more information
about what history of games is actually known.  Perhaps not alot what
known in Murray's day, but I feel Parlett missed an opportunity to tell
a bit more about what we now know; I think he doesn't really even
explain the historical significance of his own game Hare &amp; Tortoise,
which perhaps could be seen as an early influence on the Eurogames
genre, along with Acquire.  I would gladly trade away the entire
chapter on Rithmomachy for stories about John Nash playing Hex on the
bathroom floor at Princeton, and some more of the substantial history
of Go.

Also, if anyone has any other suggestions, I would like to hear them.
Thanks,
Kevin.
