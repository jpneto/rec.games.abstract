Choosing the set of rules that best embodies the Carteso concept is no easy matter.

Here are a few rulesets to choose from:

- The pieces are dominos (2x1 pieces). No tied groups can ever be created.

- Two placements per turn. At the end of a turn, no tied groups can exist on the board.

- After a player's move, all unclaimed groups whose vertical and horizontal dimensions can't grow larger are claimed. Tied groups are claimed by the opponent.

- It's illegal to deprive a tied group of "liberties" (a liberty of a group being an empty point in a row or column not occupied by that group). At the end of the game, for group claiming purposes, the liberties of a tied group are considered as part of it.

- Each player also owns one of the two diagonal directions. At the end of the game, each tied group is claimed by the player who owns the longest diagonal n-in-a-row made entirely of stones in that group.

- A tied group is provisionally owned by the player who didn't add the last stone to it. This is the current official ruleset.

- Before the game starts, two stones are placed a knight's jump away from the midpoint cell of each edge, alternating colors. There must be exactly one empty point between the two stones and both have to be in the same orthogonal line. This is Corey Clark's suggestion.
