How did it blow up in my face? I vaguely pointed to the fact I had screencapped a conversation from Halloween in which you were waiting for the "sexy" trick or treaters to come by and you did the most idiotic thing in the world and immediately not only exposed yourself but became so overly defensive about it that anyone would become suspicious. I hope you're familiar with the quote from Hamlet "Methinks the lady doth protest too much." That's basically what happened here. First off I'll tell you that people generally shy away from joking about being pedophiles because of all the stigma related to that, so even your haphazard excuse wasn't much of a defense. But the fact that you would even remember and be the first to bring up what should in that case have been a fairly unremarkable conversation is telling. Its almost as if you were trying to create some preemptive strike to do damage control before the big reveal (hint hint, you were). You could have completely diffused blame in a number of ways now that I think about it but you could not have handled that any less gracefully. And you seem to have it in your head that when I attempt to dissuade you from  casting bullshit aspersions on me (even making blatant fabrications about dog carcasses), basically unprovoked along with repeatedly calling me a "retard", I'm trying to boss you around. I guess that's just the batshit mentality of the 1%, as soon as someone discourages you from doing whatever the hell you want, you think they are trying to boss you around. Anyway I was just trying to nip this thing in the bud. But you're the one who shot himself in the foot here because you felt like you had to have absolute control of the conversation and you overplayed your hand. Now I'd be surprised if anyone could read that conversation and not become suspicious of your sexual proclivities. And by the way I wasn't nearly at the point of using that screencap. It was as I said before a defensive measure. I honestly thought you would use some common sense and just back off with the pointless barrage of insults. I didn't expect you to beg for mercy or anything like that as you seem to think. I felt more like I was dealing with a chimp than a human being, trying to use negative reinforcement to prevent it from hurling its shit my way as it is completely unmoved by more subtle forms of reasoning like social decency. 

As for your "standing", don't make me laugh. This place is basically you yelling like a buffoon all the time and the odd post from either Luis or Nick or myself. And of course the advent of Hazen Abidoucha. But I'll probably address your "standing" in a more general sense later on if the spirit moves me. You're definitely up for review. And stop with the Phil Donahue shit. "Week in review", lmfao.
