And how can you have standing in a community that is by and large against you? Right now you've engaged Hazen (who you invited here lol), Christian and now me in simultaneous flame wars. And you're only agitating Luis bit by bit with your ridiculous claims of infringement and gloating. Although I think Luis is probably a little too civilized and not masochistic enough to start up another front in this shitstorm. I'm sure you enjoy these little arguments Mark because you look for the the most piss-poor excuses to start them.
