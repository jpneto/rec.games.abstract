I have played "Reverse Reversi" several times: the rules are the same,
but the object is to get the least number of pieces with your colour.
This is a quite interesting game, with a complexity similar to normal
Reversi/Othello. I have also played with a wrap-around (torus) board,
but this is more weird than interesting.

My latest idea was to use a hexagonal grid instead of a square grid.
The initial position was a "ring" of 3 white and 3 black pieces. An
interesting bit was that not all hexes were reachable from this
initial position, which limited the connectivity too much. This can be
solved by letting the placement of a piece in the central (empty) hex
be a legal move at any time. Still, this variant does not seem
sufficiently different in play from the original Othello to get much
widespread attention.

Another idea that I have considered (but not tried yet) is to have
several kinds of pieces: some flip only along diagonal lines, some
only along cartesian lines and some along both. You have a limited
supply of either kind. One could even make a special piece that would
remove pieces (that would normally only be flipped) if they are
between two of these special pieces (and flip lines that have this
piece in one of the ends and a normal piece in the other). If you have
a limited amount of these pieces, the game will still be finite. One
could even add the posibility of using the captured pieces as one's
own (at the cost of finite play, unless one introduces a Ko-like
rule).

Using a larger board (with the usual rules) has some merit, as it
would make it harder for computers to compete due to a larger search
space and a later end-play. Going up to Go-sized boards would be too
much, but 10x10 or 12x12 would be O.K.
