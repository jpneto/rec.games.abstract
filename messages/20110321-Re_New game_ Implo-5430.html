By the way, I'm still not completely sure that the standard

I wouldn't call that annihilation.  More like desertion, though not exactly.
 Annihilation is always a plus though, just because it's fun to annihilate
things.  It emotionally charges the game.  There can be "close games" in a
sense, but in the end someone has to either resign or get annihilated.
There's no consolation prize.  No fistful of "points".  You lose, and you
lose hard.  Unless you win of course, which is always elating in a game of
annihilation.

I do like the benefit of not having to count up the score at the end.

Thanks for your comments.

I agree with you, with the reserve that, sometimes, scoring is a way
to shorten the game and get rid of a handful of superfluous endgame
moves.

In Go, for example, games played under a no-pass rule, where you lose
when you have no moves available, usually produce the same result, but
they are much longer. Played this way, Go turns into something close
to an annihilation game, but that doesn't improve the game. Moreover,
players still have to perform counting during the game in order to
choose the best moves. To some people, that can be as annoying as
having to count the score to declare a winner.

In Implo, however, it's quite the opposite than in Go. Quite
naturally, the pseudo-annihilation variant is actually shorter than
the main, scoring variant. Usually, when you (and even your opponent)
have only kings on the board, there are still many interesting moves
to be made to clinch more territory than the opponent. The question
is: are they "interesting" enough to compensate for having to count
the score at the end of the game? For now, I think they are.
