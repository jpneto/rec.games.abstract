Pommel (still open minded about renaming if there are better
suggestions) is a checkers variant.  Unlike most checkers variants, it
uses a linear capture whereby a piece can leap two or more pieces in
the same leap.  Pommel is probably free of draws, though I cannot
definitely prove this.  It is closely related to my game of Jounce,
although Jounce has the goal of breakthrough to the last rank and is
played on squares.  Pommel, originally designed for various
geometries, is now a game for hexagons, and has the goal of
elimination.  The movement of the promoted piece was inspired by Mark
Steere's "Mad Bishops" and it is this movement rule that, I believe,
makes the game decisive.  I have Zillions scripts ready for those who
are interested.


Pommel is played on a hexagonally tesselated board.  Hexagons are
arranged so that they form columns that run directly from one player
to the other.  The are two board sizes that can be used: 45 hexagons
and 76 hexagons.  On the 45-hexagon board, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th
columns contain 6 hexagons each and the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns
contain 7 hexagons each.  On the 76-hexagon board, the odd columns
have 8 hexagons and the even columns have 8 hexagons, and there are 9
columns total.

On the size-45 board, each player starts with soldiers occupying the
first two hexagons of each column.  On the size-76 board, players also
have a solider on the third hexagon of the even-numbered columns.

Soldiers move straight or obliquely forward (three directions of
noncapturing movement) through hexsides by stepping to an empty
hexagon or by hopping any number of consecutive adjacent pieces to the
next empty hexagon.

Soldiers capture by jumping or leaping.  Capturing is not restricted
to forward directions and can be done in all six directions.
Capturing is mandatory; a player that can capture, much do so.  A
player with multiple ways to capture can freely choose which one to
execute (there is no requirement to capture the maximum number of
pieces).  During all captures, pieces are removed immediately as they
are jumped and the same square can be visited multiple times.

Jump capture is like the familiar checkers capture -- the soldier
jumps over and thereby captures an adjacent opposing piece and lands
on an empty hexagon immediately beyond.  Jumping captures are multiple
and a piece that can continue to jump must do so.

To leap, a soldier starts adjacdent to a line of two or more enemy
pieces, leaps over them, and lands on the empty hexagon immediately
beyond, capturing the enemy pieces.  Leaping capture is not multiple
and a single capturing move ends the player's turn.

A soldier becomes a captain when it ends its move on the last hexagon
of a column.  A soldier that visits the promotion zone during a
jumping sequence but does not end its turn there, does not promote.

A captain may traverse any number of empty hexagons before jumping or
leaping.  When not capturing, a captain may traverse any number of
empty hexagons but must stop on a hexagon that is in an unblocked
horizontal or vertical line from an opposing piece.

The player that captures all of the opponent's pieces is the winner.
