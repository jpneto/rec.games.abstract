I'm also thinking that in Odd (Nick's game) there's probably no turn
advantage at all, as moves become increasingly 'bigger' towards the
middlegame (in most stone placement games, it's just the opposite),
and, with shared pieces, being one stone ahead is literally
meaningless. If I'm not utterly mistaken, that should be a great
feature of Odd, and one which is really hard to implement on purpose
in any game design.

Instead, I should have said "probably more scalable, but not
necessarily deeper". I understand that requiring a minimum group size
is really the key of Odd. I like how it re-introduces a territorial
component into the game, and how it counteracts the volatile nature of
the winning condition.
