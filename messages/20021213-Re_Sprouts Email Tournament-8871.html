In sprouts, either you are able to analyse the position fully (when 
either you know that you have a won position, or you know that your 
opponent has a won position but you can hope that he goes wrong), or you 
can't and the move that you make might as well be random.

Isn't this statement true of all abstract games, not just sprouts?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, certainly not.  Most abstract games that people actually play have
approximate evaluation functions, e.g., adding up material in chess, or
pip count in backgammon, etc., which can easily be used to rank moves
without analyzing the game all the way out to the end. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There are two ways to do a total position evaluation: (1) By an
exhaustive tree of analysis; (2) By use of strategical ideas.  In
practice we always use both; our tree lines almost always end in an
evaluation based on strategical ideas, such as "win by material", "win
by eventual mate", etc.  Sprouts is no different from chess in that
respect.  A sprouts player will never calculate to the legal end of a
line.

There's no
reason you need to figure out who is winning to know that you should
generally recapture your opponent's queen when the opponent initiates an
exchange of queens.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This statement is very misleading.  We always need to size up the
entire position using strategical ideas (and some tree analysis)
before making any move.  It's those automatic responses that will kill
us.  Though you "generally" recapture in the situation you describe,
how do we know any particular position is not one of the exceptions? 
Only through evaluating the position, which means evaluating the
entire position.

Well, I have no idea what "semi-rhetorical" means.  If you did have a
point, why not just make it?

Clearly a rhetorical question is a question asked with no interest
hearing an answer.  A semi-rhetorical question would be a question
with less than normal interest in hearing an answer.
