|&gt; OK, a question about hnefetafl and Tablut-- what prevents the swedes
|&gt; from making a shape like
|&gt;                           Ss
|&gt;                           ss
|&gt;                               which is completely invincible according
|&gt; to the rules as I've seen them?  (Now how do you explain <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>that<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> in terms
|&gt; of a simulation of real combat??)
|&gt; 
|&gt; --Michael Kleber                 I don't have an overactive imagination...
|&gt;   <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:kleber@husc.harvard.edu">kleber@husc.harvard.edu</a>        I have an underactive reality...   --EG

It is correct that the attackers (Muscovites) cannot capture any of the defenders (Swedes)
in this situation. Capture is by interception, i.e. one piece on each side of the enemy 
piece. So if the Swedes hold on to this position, the game ends in a draw.
Recall that the goal for the Swedes is to let the king flee off the board,
i.e. the defending player wins if there is an open row or column to the edge of the
board for the king on his/hers turn.

I do not know how likely this tie situation is to occur in a real game. It could
be difficult for the Swedes to keep the draw if all their other pieces are captured,
since they then would be forced to move one of the pieces in the 'invincible' square. 

BTW, does anybody know if there is a stalemate rule in tafl games? None of my
sources address this issue. 

I refrain from discussing the analogy to real combat...
