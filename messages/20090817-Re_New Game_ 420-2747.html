Thanks for your comments, Phil and Nick.  Not sure what a corner case
is but I think you're talking about something like the Ko rule set -
the abominable kludge that always seems to be "beyond the scope of
this text".

A "typo" was discovered in 420 which I've now fixed.

Originally I had called the game "X". The object was to get the
"maximum
unique" number of corners:

4-0-0 4 wins
3-1-0 3 wins
2-1-1 2 wins
0-2-2 0 wins

Later I convinced myself that the 3-1-0 score couldn't happen, and I
simplified
the objective to obtaining a "unique" number of corners. Now that Dave
Dyer has
corrected my error, I've taken the design back to where it was in the
first
place - sort of. It's now the "minimum unique" number of corners. I've
grown
attached to the name 420 and I didn't want to spoil it by making 3 a
possible
winning number.

Minumum unique:

0-1-3 0 wins
0-2-2 0 wins
2-1-1 2 wins
4-0-0 4 wins

Thanks to Dave Dyer for finding the error.  I vaguely remember Dave
helping me out like this once before.  I'm going to have to put him on
the payroll.

-Mark
