That is to say the four goalpiles are built up, without regard to suit, as:

Glad someone's getting into this game!  It's a good one.

Very neat observation.

Puzzle 3:

You don't make it clear if "preset by an enemy" means we also know in advance
what the order is.  So we have

Puzzle 3A:  the enemy presets the order, seen by us.

Puzzle 3B:  not seen by us - equivalently, the enemy may actually CHANGE
            the order and dish out cards according to what we do.

In scenario 3B it's clear that   N_p = N_e + 1  I think.  But in scenario 3A
there may well be a gap.  It's usually a big advantage to see what's
coming up soon, (or ever!)

I'll think about your puzzles some more.  It sounds like some may be
solvable, at least informally.

Good for you!  I'd hesitate to claim 100%, but it must be close.

Haven't tried G(3) all that much; but 35% sounds pretty damn good.
I'll give it a whirl.

Not a bit!  I do that too.  There's no point in solitaire in taxing one's
memory with "writable-down" information - there's no human opponent to feel
"cheated" by it, (even though it wouldn't be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>strictly<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> cheating even in
a multiplayer card game); so please go ahead and indent.

I go further in some solitaires - there are a few that involve picking up
a laid-out exposed row of cards and using it for re-deal.  I always consider
myself able to remember it all, and check back to view it later if I want,
(but not viewing unseen or reshuffled cards, of course).


Happy shuffling, James!
