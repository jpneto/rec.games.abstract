Another nice variant that you may wish to try is Quick dots and Boxes, where
is an analogy to 2-move-games. Each player places 2 marks at a time until
one box is surrounded on 3 edges, whence the game reverts to standard dots
and boxes.

Your game is not possible to use to analyze is the same way as standard Dots
and Boxes using Combinatorial Game Theory, and it seems unlikely that it is
at all, but it is a nice challenge!!!

Hello,

actually any board in which you

a. place pieces on a board, but do not move them from one
square/intersection to another
b. don't capture

can be played as a "paper &amp; pencil" game.

Nice examples:

Hex, Y, Renju.

Some paper &amp; pencil games can well be played on a board. Imagine
Schmittberger's Octagon with colored tiles! How beautiful!

I discovered/invented  a few games in my life such as:

1. "Pantherk�stchen" (German Dots &amp; Boxes or "K�sek�stchen" for advanced
players)
2. "Netak" (a card game which is played on an imaginary board with one to
possibly more than  100 players. Some games took months to complete. A

pure
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
game of skill deeper than Go or Chess).
3. Magnetgo (internationally known as "electric Go", -- i was quite
astonished when i learned that there were Magnetgo tournaments in the USA
and at the European Go Congress)
4. "Dornr�schendame" ("Sleeping Beauty Draughts"; a nice Draughts variant
that cannot end in a draw)
5. "Walking Purchase" (named in honor of the Lenape nation)


Today I want to introduce to you

"Pantherk�stchen".


I invented the game when i was about 8 years old, still a little Panther,
30 years ago. The game is public domain and nobody is allowed to copyright
it!

I believed that it is a rather easy game, but recently I learned that

This pre-drawn edge later becomes part of the squares conquered by the
individual player (usually this is a two players game).

"Pantherk�stchen" ("little Panther squares") differs not much from this
traditional German children's game:

squares: squares which are not and cannot completely surrounded. The game
