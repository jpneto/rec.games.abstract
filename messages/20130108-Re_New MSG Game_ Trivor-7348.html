Trouble is, perfect balance already has meaning.  Perfect balance 
simply means perfect balance.  It's an ideal.  It's a limit which

Nothing.  Perfect information is in fact perfect.

No.  A complete presentation of all available information is considered to be perfect.

Of course.  Perfect is bandied about in common parlance.  Dinner was perfect.  The 11 year old in the fairy costume was perfect.  

In mathematical discussions however, which would include game theory, perfect literally means perfect.  It doesn't mean "divides responsibility between players in such a way that neither can complain".  It simply means perfect.

If something isn't exactly perfect then it's "virtually" perfect.  You continually strive to lower the standards of mathematical discussion in order to glorify Symple.  I didn't put up with it before and I'm not putting up with it now.
