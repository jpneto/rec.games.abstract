I can't believe how much thought I've ended up putting into this

Many ways lead to Rome and you're not the first one to find the
outskirts and holding it for the center. But Ketchup was a particular
tough cookie, an idea that took form in a low resolution, revealing
unexpected properties the more high-res it became. There's nothing
wrong with that as long as there's a real game in there to provide an
anchor for the approach. I thought of your latest version of Ketchup
as a pretty neat and balanced game, but I agree gladly with your
latest shift in the nature of the mechanism because its behaviour
seems more organic (an extra stone on an <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>act<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rather than on a simple
count) and the dilemmas it poses are quite unique to it. As far as I'm
concerned you've reached the center (but I've never been to Rome :)
