a fascinating game, but the games are too short! For experienced players

Maybe. I think your comments are a bit too simplistic unless you have
first-hand experience. The number of options at each move still makes this a
deep game.

Gipf
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

is said to have simple rules, but this is only true for the basic rules
and could be called a marketing trick. Gipf played according to the
advanced "Tournament" rules is actually a chess variant (object is to
capture one or several pre-defined pieces), although quite an unusual one.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ridicoulous to define chess variants according to these rules. The goal is
to capture one or several pieces or stalemate the opponent. Since we could
as well take all pieces as the defined goal, we get another chess game in
Checkers, and yet candidates are Abalone and Octi.

One of the other standard requirements to chess games is to have various
different properties for the pieces. So, with the potentials, Gipf is
starting to look slightly more as one. (In the stanard tournament version
there are only 2 kinds of pieces)

Another is to require that the pieces move 1 by 1 on the board and capture
by replacement. Of course this is not true in Gipf either.

Octi
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

A fascinating game, but it has rather complicated rules (although the
producer claims the opposite).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

This is a little like Go, you could describe the rules in 5 minutes, but
some special cases that require some care are needed later. I've got this
game played immediately with all (around 10) new players I tried it with.

Octi quick-rules.
1. At your turn, you may add a prong, move or jump a pod, or add a pod to
one of your own bases, or a base you occupy (some of the options are subject
to restriction, you have a limited number of pods and prongs)
2. Pieces move one space, or jump as in chinese checkers, but restricted to
the direction of the prongs. Several pieces may occupy the same square, but
you may only jump onto empty squares. You may move and/or jump one or more
of the pods on the same square during a turn. Capture is always optional.
3. The game ends when 1 player occupies 1/2/3 bases of the opponents,
depending on the rules.
(These rules are not complete, but simple to explain to anyone in 5
minutes.)

Abalone
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The player having the first move is said to have a sure win. The game
doesn't sell well after the winning strategy was published on the
internet.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have no idea what you are talking to, nor which version of Abalone this
is. The problem with the original version was that it is too easy for one of
the players (usually the second) to block the board and give a draw. (see
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/abalonerules.html">http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/abalonerules.html</a>). I have
not heard of any problems with later versions, can you please provide a link
or reference.

Othello

is Reversi with a four move restriction and not a game in its own right,
but a plagiarism and a copyright fraud. BTW, in checker tournaments you
have a two or even a three-move restriction, and yet the game is still

called
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
"checker". Many people think, they can't sell a game which is in the
public domain, so they do some minor change(s) (which however do not
qualify to call them new games) and sell the old PD game under a new name.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Now I think you are again mixing up normal and tournament versions, casual
players usually do not have any more restriction either in Othello or
Reversi. Still, it seems more appropriate to call the game Reversi, which
afaik, only differs slightly in the starting setup.

Pente
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually the Japanese traditional board game Ninuki Renju, but with
primitive backward rules that give the first player a sure win (if you
really play good).  The only true rule change compared to Ninuki Renju as
played in Japan 100 years ago is that White starts while in Japan it is
Black. Very original indeed!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, I have no idea what you are talking about. I sure hope you explain
things like this more clearly in the book you say you are writing. "backward
rules"? There is a 2nd move restriction for the 2nd player, and with this
restriction the game feels like a slight first player advantage still for
casual players, but essentially not noticeable. For stronger players I think
it is around 60/40 in the first players favour.
