Being able to move a piece by a distance equal to the number of pieces 
on its row, column or diagonal is the sort of mechanism that turns me 
off.  Some people love this sort of game.  Where my sentiments differ 
from those in your own earlier post, is that I relish the fact that 
while some designers experiement with novel mechanisms, others continue 
to find new ways to use the existing ones.

The only game in Sid's book "Gamut of Games" that I found mildly
interesting was Lines of Action, a game often attributed to Sid but
which was actually invented by Claude Soucie.

This might be one of the games that turned me off, but it's that long 
since I've seen Sackson's book that I can't remember.

Well, since Lines of Action is the game that uses the mechanism you
derided in the earlier paragraph, I suspect it turned you off.

Me, I have no problem with that mechanism.  Indeed, I find it quite
elegant.  It's trivial to describe, and has amazingly subtle effects,
in that moving a piece has effects on the moves available to many
other pieces of both players.  Frankly, I think Chess is far more
contrived, with each type of piece having different rules for how
it moves, not to mention fiddly bits like pawns with special first
moves and en passant captures.  I still think Chess is a fine game,
but to disparage a new-yet-simple mechanism as in Lines of Force
while lauding classic games with far more complex mechanisms, strikes
me as rather arbitrary.
