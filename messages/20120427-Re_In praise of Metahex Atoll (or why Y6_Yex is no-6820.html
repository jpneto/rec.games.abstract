I have been trying to nail down what is the problem with Y6/Yex and I think I have found it. I am reading now "Hex strategy" by Cameron Browne and the book treats at length abouth edge templates. Edge templates are like black holes: if a chain gets close enough it gets sucked in. I think this is where the problems lies with Y6. The edge templates are huge, no they are simply enormous. This means that on medium sized boards the ratio of the playable area (not in range of templates) to the area covered by templates is very small or maybe zero. This leaves only a small margin of interesting decisions ("creativity"). Thus the area of the board is used very ineffectively. By increasing the size of the board considerably the gameplay would probably become as deep as you wish but this is cumbersome. This is what makes the game subjectively not a good one. Also dealing with very big templates is tricky and unpleasant.

By the way I think that this is also the problem with Crossway. The edge templates are too big. Naturally the game is playable and would be even more so on 21x21 or 23x23 but the above arguments apply.

I think that the problem of big templates is inherent to circular hex (metahex) boards. This is the effect of obtuse corners and only obtuse corners.. Havannah addresses the problem by disturbing the templates by various perturbations (corners excluded, two or three targets, forcing loops). This gives it a unique character but also makes it rather complicated and lacking in clarity. Also, the gameplay tends to crawl along the edges often leaving half of the board untouched.

Now to Atoll. I realized that this is the only symmetrical simple connection game on a metahex board which solves the problem of edge templates. Why? It is because putting white and black targets side by side destroys or diminishes the templates. It is because targets are very short and also because when (say) black is blocked by white and starts a ladder to the side this ladder ceases to be a threat as soon as it reaches white's territory (just a few cells away). Thus interesting gameplay is possible close to the edges. This is the essence of the game of Atoll: white and black side by side. And of course the possibility of flanking manouvers using preset stones does not hurt either.

A suggestion to improve Crossway: apply Atoll mechanism to it - divide sides in half and make one part white the other black, etc. The objective as in Atoll. Call the game CrossAtoll. What do you say to that Mr. Steere? I have not tried it, just shooting an idea.
