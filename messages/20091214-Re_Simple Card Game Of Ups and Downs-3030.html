Interesting game. In effect, each deal specifies a two player zero sum
game which in principle has an optimal strategy (though perhaps
mixed). Some deals make the game blatantly unfair (with the extreme
case of one player getting the top half of the deck).

Suppose that player 1 recieves cards 1,3,5, ..., 2n-1 and player 2
recieves cards 2,4,...,2n. It is obvious that any pure strategy that
player 1 adopts is defeated by one of player 2's (the one in which
player 2 happens to always play the successor of the card that player
1 plays - this assures player 2 will get at least n of the 2n-1 total
points. It is irrelevant that player 2 is unlikely to know what this
strategy actually is - its existence demonstrates that player 1 has no
optimal pure strategy). Player 1 can almost do something similar to
player 2 - but not quite since their 1 always loses and player 2's 2n
always wins when placed down. Thus most pure strategies of player 2
are defeated by some strategy of player 1. I suspect that all of
player 2's are defeated by at least 1 of player 1's (at least for n
sufficiently large) - but I haven't bothered to prove it. I suspect
that this deal is (slightly) unfair to player 1. Does <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> deal lead
to a fair game?

The game reminds me of a modification to the card game war called
Napolean's War that I read about here:<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.pagat.com/invented/war_vars.html">http://www.pagat.com/invented/war_vars.html</a>

Math before enough coffee doesn't mix. I misread how the game was
scored, thinking that either player got a point if the card they
played was larger than the previous card. Reading the game more
carefully, in the case where player 1 gets 1,...,n and player 2 gets n
+1,...,2n, player 1 wins in all cases by a score of n to n-1, in the
other case I mentioned it seems that it is player1 with the advantage
since they could (given psychic ability) always play the predecessor
of the card player 2 is about to play.

An interesting variation on the game is to start with the same
scenario but determine the winner in a different way. The two players
jointly generate a permutation of 1,2,...,2n. Declare player 1 the
winner if it is an odd permutation and player 2 the winner if it is
even.
I think that this game is fair given any deal with simply shuffling
your deck randomly an optimal mixed stratgey, but I haven't proved it
rigorously.
