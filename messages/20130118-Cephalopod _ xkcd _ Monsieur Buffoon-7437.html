Monsieur Buffoon posted something on xkcd apparently questioning Cephalopod's originality.  Said post was then removed by a moderator, but not before someone was able to respond to it.

"The name is a bit strange, but the game itself seems pretty fun. The 3x3 version seems like it would be the best one to learn how to play with.

I have no particular reason to suspect that it isn't original. What makes you think it might not be?"

I guess that settles it then.

Monsieur Buffoon, xkcd is a very closely moderated forum.  Did you really think you could start some shit there about Cephalopod? lol  What a ZERO!!!!
