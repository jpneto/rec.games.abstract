No, Bill.  The problem that Torben identified in my earlier attempt
applies to your game as well.  I'll translate it for you in a way that
applies specifically to your game.

No Mark, it doesn't, as I shall explain in a moment.  It wasn't clear
which game Torben's remark was intended to apply to, but in
any event it doesn't apply to mine, nor to your "Torus"; though
I note you have wisely included redundancy in the ruleset,
to help out those who can't keep up with the logic.

In your game N wins if he forms an N-S loop, and Z wins if he forms an
E-W loop.  In the case that neither player achieves his loop goal and
instead there are two helices, N wins if there is a negative gradient
and Z wins if there is a positive gradient.

The problem is that if Z makes an N-S loop <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a helix with a
negative gradient, he hasn't achieved either of his goals but he
prevents N from achieving either of his.

Alas, no.  If someone makes both a N-S loop <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>and<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> NW-SE loop,
then he has <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>automatically<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> made an E-W loop as well.  In fact,
he "owns" the global board, in that his opponent will not now
be able to make a loop of <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> kind.  I didn't mention this
earlier because I thought it would have been obvious.
Sorry to be taking too much on trust.

Here is a "proof".

Now, look at this path.  From the central intersection,
go up the vertical line, up it from the bottom, turn right
down the diagonal line, and go right around to come in
from the left again, back to the intersection.

This path has done a complete west-to-east
circumnavigation, and (a careful tracking will show!)
no N-S circumnavigation at all.

If you draw it for yourself, making the paths quite thick,
and carefully stick to the appropriate edge of each path,
(changing sides where necessary), you can even make
it look completely non-self-intersecting.

So this is wrong.

Try to keep up with the logic, Mark!  Try to use your game
theoretic wits to the best advantage.  We know you have
them, from your many excellent games, so try your best.
And you might also try to be less touchy, egotistical, and
dismissive of others.

Of course we all do.  Try not to be so childishly egocentric.
