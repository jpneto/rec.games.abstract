Indeed not, but still YEX is a good name!

 The player who connects the
three sections with a single chain of his stones wins. Draws are not
possible in Yex, and, as in Y (I hope I will be right this time) a

Yes, you are right, (and Nick's comment about half the board each
is mistaken, as I'm sure he will see if he sketches a tiny pic.)

Of course, this is simply Y played on a board whose corners have been

You are right again.  There is, OC, a whole family of such Y games,
played on any-shaped board, with any three marked exterior sections
that overlap only at one cell per adjacency, and the board interior
is locally hex, (or more generally of constant valence 3.)
The three sections need not be of equal length.  As it is still
an equi-tasked game, neither player has an advantage,
(except the first player, as always eliminable by PIE).

I take it you mean more symmetrical.

Barely; and these are aesthetic matters only.

Yes, Joao Neto and I have played it, but in the end regular Y
seems more natural.

There is, OC, a whole super-family of such games, consisting
of any ODD number of sides, (the PARITY CURSE again!)
We have played 5-Y, (on a jewell-shaped board, a truncated
rhombus), which is quite fun, and I think once or twice, 7-Y.

5-Y is possible to play on a regular penatagonal board,
still with (mostly) interior hex cells, but this requires drawing
a special board, which is a pain.

The winning criterion for 5-Y is obvious, but for 7 and above,
one needs to be careful, as there are conflicting Y shapes.
The proper method is to regard each of the 7 sections as
a single blob, then the winner is whoever makes a Y whose
3 blobs mark off 3 blob-sections that are each less than
half the blobby-circumference.

The ultimate form of this, OC, is the case where EVERY
exterior point is a blob of its own, in which case the wnning
criterion is my favourite:- two nearly-opposite points OR
a Y with convex hull enclosing the centre.
This is, in fact, the same criterion as the blobby thing
mentioned above!

There must be an ODD number of exterior cells, (or blobs),
respectively.  e.g. an  n:(n+1):n:(n+1):n:(n+1) hexagon
is nice!   But the PARITY CURSE cannot be avoided!!!
