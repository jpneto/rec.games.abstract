let me be clear that the original question had to do with
this quote:

"We have seen occasional positions that tended toward stalemate and
piece shuffling...  I consider it unlikely that playing to win at
Arimaa will drive us toward such corners of the position space,"

The data I have shown earlier in this thread shows that draws have not
happened to this point in actual play.

That's right, stupid Thomas.  The question is, Why is that significant
in a game with superko?

"Out of context"?  The fact that "[Arimaa players] have seen
occasional positions that tended toward stalemate and piece shuffling"
is being presented out of context?  Tell us, stupid Thomas, what
context should the observed, drawish play of Arimaa be viewed in??

Dumb ass, you're answering the wrong question.  Remember, a few short
lines back, when you said "What Significance so I ascribe to a zeroed
out draw column?  Before I answer that..."?

When are you going to answer that, shit brain?

Finally, you have the right to continue referring to me as dumb ass,

Yes, and you have the right to continue being a stupid, lying, dumb
ass, and the like - a right which you've apparently chosen to
exercise.

Fine.  Get the fuck out of here, stupid, lying, dumbass, and the
like.  I thought you were already gone.  You're following in the
footsteps of Korneliussen.  Stunned from your last bitch slap, you
come reeling back for another one.
