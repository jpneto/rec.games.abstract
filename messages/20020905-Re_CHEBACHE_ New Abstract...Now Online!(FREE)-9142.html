Hi Douglas,

The statement that it combines chess and checkers with backgammon is unlikely &gt;to produce much interest from backgammon players.

Well, there may be some truth to that, but, I've found that 
Backgammon players are usually fairly enthusiastic. They also 
have a slight advantage as a beginner, since they are already 
used to playing the odds and other basic concepts that make up 
the backbone of Chebache.

I think chess could use some mild randomization so that one can have "rollouts" as in backgammon (or Scrabble, though

There are several games that introduce chance into a Chess game.
One of these is Nightmare Chess. It adds cards to the game that 
allow special powers or constraints to a piece. They also create
bazaar situations. One which I remember is a card played said 
that we had to turn the board 90 degrees, but still play as you 
would normally, moving across towards your opponent. A bit of a 
twister. The use of cards and how they are played are also
strategic since you need to know when it's best to play a card
and when it's best to hold it for later in the game, or try to get 
rid of it. There are at least 2 sets of cards available...unless 
they are out of print already. I think they titled it accurately.

Scott Pardee
