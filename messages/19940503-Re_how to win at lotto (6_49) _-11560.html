I have heard that numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6 (6 number lotto) get played
so much that if it ever came up each winner would get $20.  Also
numbers that translate into 3 dates (3 of 1-12 and 3 of 1-31) also
generate low payouts if they win.

To "prove" the above, I would like to tell you what happened in the summer of 1989
in the New Zealand lottery. 
I played in the lottery every week, and noticed that out of the 3.6 million combinations,
usually there would be 0, 1, 2 or 3 winners, sharing the approximately  $NZ 1,000,000
(which equated to around $US 600,000.

Then one sunday night the following numbers were drawn (not in this order, but that
is irrelevant): 7, 17, 27, 37, ?, ? (I forgot the last two). Knowing that 7 is a lot
of people's lucky number, and seeing all available 7's being drawn, I expected that there
would be more winners than usual.

There were 23 winners (or losers :-)).

The evening news had a special on it, showing a $1,000,000 house, a $300,000 house, and
finally showing something worth $50,000 to indicate what the winners lost.

As a nice touch, they had a mathematician from Auckland University explain that the
probability of this happening was approximately 10^(-60). Of course, the guy was completely
wrong, as I showed in the letter to the New Zealand Herald, where they did not print it,
because they did not understand it either.
