 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raidin...@gmail.com">raidin...@gmail.com</a> Box Off is a solitaire game, so technically this post is off topic.  2-Player perfect information game purists will want to read no further.  Here are the rules: The standard size for it is 8x6, and the standard number of different kinds of tiles is

 Mark Steere Nice concept :) Not an abstract game, but that's ok.  There's plenty of bandwidth to spare now that Hazen ran away like a whipped dog. And now that nobody (including me) can come up with anything original.  Some of us (including Luis The Mangy) are e

 Nick Bentley I may actually have an original thing or two to show in the next few months. No promises, but I've got a couple of weird ones in development.

 Mark Steere Looking forward, Nick :)

 Nick Reymann Neat!  It reminds me of an old DOS game called Sixx which I used to play, except that in Sixx, you only need one or two consecutive "edges" of the rectangle to be empty, not the entire area of it.  (Another way to visualize it is that there needs to

 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raidin...@gmail.com">raidin...@gmail.com</a> Interesting.  If you get a chance to try Box Off, I'd be curious to know how you think it compares to Sixx in terms of complexity..  I recommend playing Box Off on a 12x8 board with 4 different kinds of tiles.

 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raidin...@gmail.com">raidin...@gmail.com</a> I'm not sure you understand the rules correctly.  It looks like you're removing the w's at d1 and e2?  If so, this is illegal because the rectangle isn't otherwise empty (there's a y at d2).


Feb 23

 me Oops.  Actually, I do understand the rules but in my haste messed things up.  (I solved it by first circling the rectangular groups around corner pairs, then constructing the order that leads to that configuration).  Here's my corrected solution...


Feb 23

 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raidin...@gmail.com">raidin...@gmail.com</a> Yes that's correct.


Feb 23

 me I might be interested in making a (free) computer version of Box Off (both Axiom &amp; Zillions).  Is that alright with you?


Feb 23

 <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:raidin...@gmail.com">raidin...@gmail.com</a> Yes that'd be great!

 Daniel S. interesting puzzle! I guess to generate them you just work backwards? Is there a way to be sure that there is only 1 solution when generating the puzzle? given an even number of b, w, and y respectively will there always be a solution for a filled bo

Yes, increase the number of different kinds of stones (from 3 to 4). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's also rec.puzzles. You might try getting feedback there as well. 

First off, the version I posted plays a slightly different game which I will fix of course. 

I'm looking for effective ways of creating new puzzles, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them.  I don't think working backwards necessarily works since you at least have to make sure you're not creating any irregular gaps in the process that can't later accomodate a box off move (e..g. a 1x1 box, or a 2x1 "L").

work backwards. 
allow gaps. 
maybe even put orange stones in the gaps and instruct to remove them at the start of the puzzle. 
it might have aesthetic value even.

That works too, although it may result in a slightly easier puzzle since there would be fewer tiles remaining. 

I think this works... 

Work backwards, but don't make any moves that result in an odd sized gap.  That works because any even size gap can be filled in by some combination of 2x1 boxes (or larger). 

This leads to the following strategy.  Don't make a move which produces an odd sized gap. 

(I strongly suspect there is a "parity" aspect to this puzzle)
