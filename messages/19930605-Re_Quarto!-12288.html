|&gt; I was at a Con last weekend, and I saw a game called 'Quarto!' there.
|&gt; (My guess is, that they wanted to call it 'Quatro!', but that someone 
|&gt; already TM-ed it...)

Could you be so friendly and tell us a bit about the rules of Quarto ?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Sure. The game is played with two players, on a board of four by four
squares, and with sixteen pieces, all different. A piece has the
following characteristics:
  - White or black
  - Big or small
  - Round or square
  - Whole, or with a hole in the top

So, you have a small black sqaure with a hole, a small black square that is
whole, a big black sqaure with a hole, etc, etc.

One player begins, and he selects a piece. His opponent must place the piece
on the board, and select a piece to give back, and so on.
The winner of the game is the player that completes a line of four.
A line of four consists of four pieces, that have (at least) one thing
in common, be it that they are all black, or all big, or whatever.

So, a line of four can consist of:
  - A big white round with a hole
  - A big black sqaure that is whole,
  - A big white square with a hole,
  - A big white round that is whole.
(The four pieces are all big.)

So, that is about it. It's easy to learn, but not so easy to master.
Currently, I am working on a program for Windows 3.x that will play
Quarto!, and when it is finished, I will release it as freeware.
I'll post on this group when it is finished.

Greetings,
