My professor is looking for a game that can be played by two players who are
only in contact through speech.  The game should be as interactive as possible
and have definite means of "winning" although it does not need to be competitive.
The "winning" should be measurable in a finite amount of time, and there may
be quality attributes to how well the players played.

Please respond with ideas via e-mail if possible.  I will summarize and post the
results.

Thanks,
