|&gt;   If you want a game without defects, try Hex.  For those
|&gt; who don't know, Hex is played on a rhombus of hexagons (or,
|&gt; for go players, the veritices of a triangular lattice).  One
|&gt; player plays black stones, the other white.  Black tries to
|&gt; connect the top and bottom edges of the board with a solid
|&gt; line of black stones, and white tries to do the same from left
|&gt; to right.  The game has no draws, no complicated rules, and
|&gt; is difficult.  The biggest drawback is that the first move 
|&gt; is a significant edge.

Indeed, a winning advantage (by strategy stealing) with perfect play.
Is it a "defect" that one knows what the result of the game should be
even if one cannot actually execute a strategy to achieve it? (Rather
than merely knowing that there must be some definite result of perfect
play, as in chess or go.)
