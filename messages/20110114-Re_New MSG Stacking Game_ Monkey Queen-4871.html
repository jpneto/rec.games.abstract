It's hard to determine a precise stack size for Monkey Queen.  Many of the
burn through games ended up with move totals in the low fifties.  To me that
seems a little short and I think stack sizes 13 or 14 would be better than
12.  But I'm going to leave stack size as an open option and suggest 12 to
14 checkers.

Three people have proposed variants of Monkey Queen since I released it four
days ago which of course is very flattering.  However, I didn't like any of
the suggested variants and I almost certainly will not like any other Monkey
Queen variants.  Allow me to explain.  I stated earlier that Monkey Queen
was my first game-centric design in the sense that gameplay was my focus
instead of architecture, my usual focus.  Architecture was never far from
view however, and still is not.

The game-centric part of Monkey Queen's design was mainly just the initial
inspiration of Amazons.  I needed queens and I needed stacks.  Monkey
Queen's design was pure and complete in its moment of conception, except for
queens not giving birth while killing.  That rule was added for the second
test play to make the game tree bigger, and it resulted in much better
gameplay.  That was the sole design tweak, except for the board size and
stack size adjustments that followed.

I think the game-centric experiment was me trying not very successfully to
reinvent myself, and not getting very far.  It was certainly never intended
to be an endless journey of major design changes in quest of some sort of
ideal gameplay.

My focus is once again on the architecture of Monkey Queen, or more
specifically, being supremely satisfied with its architecture and being
repulsed by any suggestion of modifying it.  Like all my games, Monkey Queen
is minimally based on a minimal concept.  You can't make Monkey Queen any
simpler.  You can only make it more complicated, subtracting from one of its
key architectural highlights, its simplicity.  The three variants were,
predictably, more complicated.

Monkey Queen's gameplay is fantastic as far as I'm concerned.  Even if I
were convinced that a variant had better gameplay, which I'm way not
convinced of for any of the variants I know of, I still wouldn't change the
rules (or approve a variant) because it would harm the architecture.
