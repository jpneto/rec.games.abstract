I've got a similar issue with my very first game, Quadrature:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Quadrature_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Quadrature_rules.pdf</a>

[NOTE: In anticipation of Bill Taylor's mindless shrieking about Quadrature,
know that I received the coveted Mensa award for Quadrature, as well as
Games magazine's top abstracts for the year.  Mensa doesn't mean shit to me.
 Ten dollars or a fresh 'possum and you're in.  But Bill, I believe it's one
more Mensa award than you have.  So STFU.]

In designing Quadrature I first invented a "squaring" mechanism, whereby if
you form a rectangle with three of your pieces and one of your opponent's
(as the 4 corners of the orthogonal rectangle), the enemy piece converts to
one of your own.  This can initiate a chain reaction of such squarings.

This was my first game mechanism ever, and it was kind of a eureka moment,
so what did I do?  I slapped it into a game.  I modeled it after Checkers,
with opposite armies on opposite sides, charging forward and through each
other.  Why?  It was all I really knew about games at the time.  I had no
notions of finite game and such.

One day, a couple years after designing Quadrature, I experienced a draw -
an endless aggressive exchange.  Yuck!

Quadrature continues to be one of my most fun games to play, oddly.  I just
finished a very satisfying game of Quadrature on Scott Nesin's server,
GamesByEmail (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gamesbyemail.com/">http://www.gamesbyemail.com/</a>).  So in a sense, if it works,
don't fix it.  I only experienced a draw once in hundreds of plays, but it
was such a sucky experience, I vowed to henceforth only design finite games.

Which kind of leads me back to my point.  I've considered coming up with a
finite, omnidirectional (as opposed to bidirectional, like unkinged
checkers) game using the squaring mechanism but just not Quadrature.  The
only thing stopping me is I'm too lazy.  Plus maybe it isn't even possible.

Unfortunately [Bill Taylor has] failed to criticize in any recognizable

Bill thinks of his crass insults as invaluable, constructive criticism. 
It's complicated...

You just paint an image of me that actually looks a lot more like you,

Bill, NOBODY is applauding you, especially not your own colleagues you're
embarrassing the shit out of at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.


Bill Taylor has long struggled with his own hypocrisy.  Case in point -
making a group fucked up by bellowing about how fucked up it is.  He's like
Clark on bgg, derailing topics to protest their perceived derailment, lol  
The problem being, of course, that these particular two clowns can't derail
their own flies.
