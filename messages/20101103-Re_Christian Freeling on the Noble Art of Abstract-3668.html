It's incredibly frustrating to me that 90% of the posts here (and
other places) are personal attacks that have nothing to do with game
design.  What's so hard about restricting your posts to a discussion
of games on their merits?  How come there are so many impossibly
sensitive egos wrapped up in an endeavour for which the stakes could
not possibly be smaller?  If there's an activity with less cosmic
significance that abstract game design I don't know what it is.

Behaving well is soooo trivial.  It boggles my mind that we don't do
it.  Just ask yourself if the post you're about to write will be
helpful to someone.  If not, don't post.

I totally agree with Nick.
