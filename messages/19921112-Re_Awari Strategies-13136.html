  When you drop beans, you include the cups on the end as part of your

In the version I had as a kid (a boardgame from Swedish game
manufacturer ALGA), the rules said you could get several free moves.
That meant from this position:

    X X X X X 6
  K             K
    X X X 3 2 1
          a b c

you could get 12 beans. (Play c, b, c, a, c, b)

  Here is the 'capture' move; if your last bean falls in an empty cup,
  you get your bean and the beans in the cup opposite the one you landed
  in (even if the one you landed in was on the opponent's side), and put
  them into your kalaha (?).
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

In my version, you only captured the beans in the opponent's cup if
your last bean was dropped in one of your own cups. However,
'wrap-around' was allowed, as in:
    
    3 X X X X X
  K             K
    0 X X X X 8

By playing c, you add 6 beans to your kalaha. Note that you don't ever
put a bean in your opponent's kalaha.

Well, I'm not 100% sure myself...
