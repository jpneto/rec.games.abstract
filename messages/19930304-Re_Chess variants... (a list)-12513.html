Two questions: can black's pawns capture?  Can black use his two moves
to move trough check on the first?

Let's see.  If no, no, then this is a pretty simple win for white, and
the only varisble is # of moves.  If yes/no, black still seems dead.  If
no/yes or yes/yes, then black has considerable stall power, but no chance
of winning, and can still only get the stalemate by white error.

the way i played this was yes/yes  and there is no way for White to avoid
checkmate.  the double-moving king is more powerful than a Queen.  this
first came to my attention as a bar trick to get a free drink off an
unsuspecting rube.  the pawns are unnecessary, but put in to make the
problem seem plausible.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I have my doubts.  To start, let white's strategy be to move only the
two rook pawns.  I do not think black can stop both, so white will
eventually have a queen and two rooks free.  During this time the king
will be safe and black cannot move his pawns nor can he bring his king
past to the 7th rank (as the whole 6th rank is in check by the pawns,
so he can't start a move there, and the whole 7th rank is protected by
the rook/bishop/royalty).

At this point white can use the two rooks and the queen to mate (even
against a superking) by creating a three space wide check zone, and
marching the king to doom.  Protecting the three peices from attack,
while not easy,is possible with good play.

The only trick would be that this would possibly take more than 50 moves
after obtaining the queen, and white could not afford any pawn moves
during this time, so black could claim stalemate this way.

Lifting the 50 move rule, I still think black is doomed, unless there is
a flaw in this strategy I overlooked.
