Solving it was a really interesting programming challenge, and
watching a few dozen optimal games quite fun. It certainly
doesn't compare to games like Go, but I thought some people
here might be interested, it is an abstract strategy game after all.

The reason I decided to solve it was that 3M is played at Vying
Games and many users have found that it's an unfair game.
With my program I found that just changing the starting
position is enough to fix the problem, making it almost even.

I've been developing a Cephalopod AI recently. I've even played the
game against you and, curiously, you appeared to have absolutely
no idea of basic strategy or common sense. I think it's best that I
abandon that project and work on something else instead; your mental
health might not be able to handle <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>another<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> abstract strategy game
