You'd only need to play a perfect, finite-decisive game once.  Playing it
two or more times only serves to introduce draws into the match.  One play
would be ideal even for a nearly perfect game.  Oust is about as close to
"mythically perfect" as a game can be.

Yeah, you tell those patzers who organize go and shogi championships
that title matches should be in a best of 1 format! :-P  No seriously,
match play is here to stay, not because matches are needed to fix a
game, but because we want to remove some of the randomness of playing
games (however, always just some, no one is willing to play the
minimum 50 games necissarily to have the victor definetly go to the
better player) so that the victor will more often be the better
player.

Go and Arimaa also. I don't think there's anything mythical about it.

You don't think there is anything mystical about a game that has
exactly a 50/50 win rate by design while not having draws possible?
Sure there are a lot of games that come close (Go isn't one of them,
win rates significantly favor one or the other, since the closest komi
to equal has a draws as possible [though it constantly moves])

That's a pretty big "all you have to do is".  The consequences of having a
draw now are even more dire than ever since you've spent the whole fucking
day playing "sufficient games to avoid a draw" only to end up having a draw
anyway.  Winning!  Not.

My concern is similar. Playing abstracts is tiring, you can't just
keep adding on games until you have a statistically robust sample.
When you talk about 6+ matches, endurance becomes as much of a factor
as skill and effort. I'd rather draw because I played a drawish game
than lose because we were playing for 12 hours and my opponent
outlasted me.

what we are talking about is MATCH play here, so best of one is
already not going to happen, mark, i made that clear several times
that this analysis is for MATCH PLAY ONLY.  If you want to attack the
reasonableness of match play at all, that should probably become its
own thread, and not a critisizm of analysis on it.
And second, you are in a match, length is already there, the
proportion that you have to lengthen it is bairly any, probably none.
If you are worried that you can hold out for 6 matches, but not for 7,
the choice of the director on the base number has FAR FAR more impact
than any lengthening
