TAIFAS

An equal goals game without draws. For two players, played with black
and white stones on a quad board. Each player takes possesion of all
the stones of one color. On his turn, starting with Black, a player
must place a stone of either color on an empty square. The pie rule is
used: after Black's first turn, White has the option of swapping
sides. When the board is full, the player with the most zones wins. In
case of a tie, the owner of the last completed zone loses.

Definitions:

A player's zone is a square or an orthogonally adjacent group of
squares, not occupied by that player, that borders orthogonally only
on his own stones or on his stones and one or more of the board's
edges. It is equivalent to Go's concept of territory, but without
distinction between empty squares and squares occupied by the
opponent. In the following example, both X's and O's have five zones:

x o x . o
o o x o .
. x o . .
x . x o o
. x o x .

...but this isn't the end of the game, as the board isn't full yet?

Variant:

Alternatively, you can value every zone 1/n points, n being the number
of squares that the zone contains. The player with the most points
win. This adds an additional layer of strategy, but it may be too
complicated.

Any comment is welcome :-) .
