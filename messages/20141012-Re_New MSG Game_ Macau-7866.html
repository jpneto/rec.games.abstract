MACAU

by Mark Steere



INTRODUCTION

Macau is a two player dice game designed for gambling.  Luck and strategy combine to create unique and challenging play.  Mark Steere designed Macau in October, 2014.



EQUIPMENT

The two players, Black and White, each have twelve dice of their own color and a large dice cup.  A doubling cube is used.  Macau can be played on any flat surface, such as a small table.  Four horizontal, parallel lines, running left to right, are required, and can be formed with tape.  These lines demarcate the play areas.  Two of the lines, about four inches apart, bisect the table.  These are the bet lines, and between them is the bet area.  Wagered bets are placed in the bet area, as is the doubling cube, initially.  The remaining two lines are located about four inches away from each player's edge of the table.  These are the roll lines.  Between the roll lines and the bet area are the players' respective roll areas.  Players keep their chips which haven't been wagered behind their respective roll lines.



SETS

A set is comprised of exactly three dice of the same color and denomination.  For example, three black 4's form a black 4-set.  The value of a set is equal to its denomination.  For example, a 5-set (three 5's) is worth five points.  To claim a set of a particular denomination, you can roll all three dice of that denomination in one turn or you can accumulate them over multiple turns.  Only one set of a particular denomination can exist at a time.  For example, the players can't both own the 2-set simultaneously.  And for example, a player can't own two 1-sets.



After claiming a set, you may choose to relinquish it in a later turn by putting one or more of the three dice forming the set into your dice cup.  Then the set is available to be reclaimed by either player.  But while you own a set, your opponent can't form a set of the same denomination.



OBJECT OF THE GAME

The first player to obtain a score of 11 or more points wins.  A player's set values are added up to form his total score.  For example, if you own the 2-set, the 4-set, and the 6-set, you've obtained a total score of 2+4+6=12, and you've won.  Draws cannot occur in Macau.



DOUBLING CUBE

Players use the cube (doubling cube) to double the amount of the initial wager.  The cube has on its six faces the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.  The cube is initially placed in the bet area, with the 2 showing (on the top face of the cube).  At certain times in the game, described below in the Play section, a player can offer to double the current wager by placing the cube in his opponent's roll area.  The player who has been offered the cube (the offeree) has two choices: 

Choice 1. The offeree can accept the cube by placing it behind his roll line and adding an amount of chips to the bet area equal to the total amount he's already placed there, thereby doubling his bet.  The offeror of the cube then likewise doubles his own wager and play continues.  

Choice 2. The offeree can decline the double by removing the cube from his play area and placing it in the bet area, thereby forfeiting the game.  The winner then takes all of the chips from the bet area.



The first time a double is offered, the offeror removes the cube from the bet area and places it into his opponent's roll area, with the cube still showing a 2.  If the offeree accepts the cube by placing it behind his roll line, the offeree now owns and controls the cube.  While you own the cube, i.e., while the cube is behind your roll line, you (and only you) can offer to re-double the current bet during one of your later turns.  If you own the cube and you choose to offer a double, you turn the cube to show its next higher number.  For example, if the cube currently shows a 4, you would turn it to show an 8, and place it into your opponent's roll area.  If your opponent were to accept your offer to double, he would place the cube behind his roll line, still showing an 8, and both players would then double their bets as described above.  Now your opponent would own and control the cube, and you wouldn't have access to the cube unless it were offered to you later in the game.



Again, each player can offer the cube only at certain times in the game, described in the Play section below.



START OF THE GAME

Bet:

Players must agree on the initial amount to wager.  Once the wager has been determined, each player takes that amount from behind his roll line and places it into the bet area.

Initial Roll:

Players simultaneously roll six dice each into their respective roll areas, while keeping their unrolled dice behind their respective roll lines, outside of their roll areas.  The rolled dice in a player's roll area form his "hand".  



If the two opening hands are identical, both players remove their hands from their roll areas and again simultaneously roll six dice each until they achieve two different outcomes.  Once they have two non-identical, opening hands, the larger of the two is determined as follows: If one player has more 6's than the other player, he wins the opening roll.  If both players have an equal number of 6's, or neither player has any 6's, they then compare their respective number of 5's, and so on.  For example, 6-5-5-4-3-1 beats a 5-5-5-3-3-2 because one 6 is more than zero 6's.  6-5-4-3-3-2 beats 6-5-3-2-1-1 because each hand has one 6 and one 5, but the winning hand has a 4 while the losing hand doesn't have any 4's.  5-5-4-3-3-2 beats 5-4-4-3-2-2 because, while there are no 6's in either hand, there are two 5's in the winning hand and only one 5 in the losing hand.



If a player has rolled 6-6-6-5-5-5 and his opponent has not, then the player with the 6-6-6-5-5-5 has won and can claim all the chips from the bet area.  Otherwise play continues as follows.



The player with the greater hand is designated Player 1.  The other player, Player 2, immediately removes his hand from his roll area and places all twelve of his dice in his dice cup.  





If Player 1 has rolled more than three dice of a particular denomination, he must immediately place the excess dice back in his dice cup.  For example, Player 1 has rolled the following hand:

Player 1

5-5-5-5

2

1



Player 1 must immediately remove one of his 5's from the table and place it in his dice cup, leaving him with the following hand:

Player 1

5-5-5

2

1



This completes Player 1's turn.



PLAY

Following Player 1's first turn, players take turns completing the following four steps, beginning with Player 2. 

Step 1: Doubling Decision

If the cube is still on the bar or if you own the cube, you must decide whether or not to offer a double to your opponent.  At the start of Player 2's first turn, the cube will still be on the bar since this is the first time in the game that a double can be offered. (See the Doubling Cube section above.)  If you offer a double and your opponent refuses it, you win.  Otherwise, continue with the remaining steps of your turn.

Step 2: Remove Dice

If your opponent formed any sets on his last turn, and you have dice of the same denominations as those sets in your roll area, you must remove those dice and place them in your dice cup.  You may then strategically select for removal any or all of the remaining dice in your roll area and place them in your dice cup as well.  On Player 2's first turn, he won't initially have any dice in his roll area, and therefore he skips Step 2.

Step 3: Roll

Thoroughly shake the dice in your cup and roll them into your roll area.

Step 4: Remove Excess Dice

If you've rolled any dice in the denominations of sets your opponent already owns, you must remove your dice of those denominations and place them in your dice cup.  For example, if your opponent owns the 3-set, and you've rolled any number of 3's, you must remove all of your 3's.



Combining the dice from your current roll with dice you already have in your roll area, if you have more than three dice of identical denomination, you must remove the excess dice.   For example, if the dice in your roll area include five 6's and four 2's, you must remove two of the 6's and one of the 2's and place them in your dice cup.



Players should arrange their dice in groups for clarity, though it isn't strictly necessary to do so.



At the conclusion of your turn, calculate your score (see the Object of the Game section above) to see if you've won.



EXAMPLE

Player 1 has the following hand at the conclusion of his initial turn.

Player 1

5-5-5 (having removed one of his 5's)

2

1



Now it's Player 2's first turn and, having decided not to offer a double, he rolls all twelve of his dice to obtain the following hand:

Player 2

6-6

5-5-5-5

4

3-3

2-2-2



Player 2 must immediately remove all four of his 5's and place them in his dice cup because Player 1 already owns the 5-set.  Player 2 is then left with the following on the table:

Player 2

6-6

4

3-3

2-2-2



Now it's Player 1's turn again.  He decides not to double.  Player 1 must remove the 2 from his hand because Player 2 has formed the 2-set.  Player 1 now has the following hand:

Player 1

5-5-5

1



Player 1 strategically decides to remove the 1 from his hand since it isn't worth very much in this situation, leaving him with the following hand:

Player 1

5-5-5



Player 1 then rolls the 9 dice in his cup.  Combining his rolled dice with the 5-5-5 in his roll area, he ends up with

6

5-5-5

4-4-4

3

2-2-2

1



Player 1 must remove his 2's because Player 2 already owns the 2-set, leaving player 1 with the following hand:

Player 1

6

5-5-5

4-4-4

3

1



Now it's Player 2's turn again.  Player 2 decides to offer a double to Player 1 by removing the cube from the bar and placing it into Player 1's roll area.  Player 1 accepts the double, placing the cube behind his roll line, and both players double their bets.  Player 2 selects the 4 for removal from his hand and places it in his dice cup, creating the following hand:

Player 2

6-6

3-3

2-2-2



Player 2 then rolls the 5 dice in his cup.  Combining his rolled dice with his current hand, he obtains the following hand:

Player 2

6-6-6

5

3-3-3

2-2-2-2

1



Player 2 removes the 5 from his hand since Player 1 already owns the 5-set.  And Player 2 must remove a 2 from his hand since he has four 2's, creating the following hand:

Player 2

6-6-6

3-3-3

2-2-2

1



Player 2 has won with a score of 6+3+2=11.



PLAYING A SERIES

Players will typically choose to play a series of games, since each game is short in duration.  There's no need to start each game in the series with a simultaneous roll.  After the first game, use the rule that the player who won the most recent game takes the first turn in the current game, but only rolls six dice on his first turn.  After Player 1's first turn of the game, players take turns rolling up to twelve dice per turn for the remainder of the game.



COCKED DICE

If any of the rolled dice are tilted, even slightly, the tilted dice are removed and re-rolled.  If any dice come to rest on top of other dice, but are perfectly level, then the dice on top can be carefully removed and placed directly on the table, preserving their orientations so they retain the same denominations.



MACAU SIZE VARIATIONS

The set size of 3 was chosen arbitrarily.  Any set size can be used from 1 on up.  For example, a set size of 6 can be used.  Four dice per set size are provided, optimally.  So for example, using set size 6, each player would have 24 dice, and players would roll 12 dice each on the first, simultaneous roll, and up to 24 dice each on subsequent rolls.  The larger the set size, the longer the game.  Macau is surprisingly playable using a set size of 1 with 4 dice for each player.  It's just a shorter game.



TURN ORDER ADVANTAGE

Macau is a remarkably fair game.  During testing, in which Macau was played hundreds of times, there was no detectable statistical advantage (or disadvantage) in being the first to take a turn.  Such a phenomenally equitable game as Macau can be considered a Holy Grail in a universe of unbalanced games.

First comments about the presentation :

Rules seems too complicated to me.
I would suggest you to separate the gambling part rules from the play rules..
It will be easier to understand the game.
Some people has not a big knowledge on the gambling vocabulary so some definitions will be helpful.

Comments about the play itself will come later.
