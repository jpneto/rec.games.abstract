Woohoo!

I used to be more of a "ties are never, ever, ever ok" guy, but I'm
changing. I've played to a couple of jaw-dropping, thrilling ties in a
few games.  I didn't know those existed.

But it's a tall order to actually design a game wherein ties feel
thrilling, so a good rule of thumb is to stay away from ties unless
you really know what you're doing. One requirement is that ties be
extremely rare (because they're only thrilling if you feel like you
found a 100-leaf clover when you end up in one), which illustrates the
difficulty because how do you design so that you're sure ties are so
rare at all humanly achievable levels of play?

It's this line of thought that got me interested in tie-breakers as a
possible way to have your cake and eat it too [plugs ears to stern
rebuke...I know I know...de gustibus not est disputandum].  I like the
idea that, upon achieving a tie, the tie breaker "takes you down a
layer" and you see there's a whole other layer of stuff to worry
about. That seems like it could be thrilling. How achievable that idea
is is an open question because there are two big difficulties in doing
so:

1. You don't want tie-breakers to feel arbitrary and most do.
2. There must be enough clarity/sensibility in the tie-breakers that
players can pursue them while playing toward the main goal.  Otherwise
the outcome will feel like a coin flip. Of course it also has to be
enjoyable to pursue them, which means that pursuing them mustn't feel
like swatting flies while riding a horse, if that makes sense.
(grrrrr. the "feel" of a game is of primary importance to me but I
don't have good ways to talk about it)

If they  can avoid those traps then I believe tie breakers can add
tactical and strategic richness. Too bad it's so hard to avoid them

The game which IMO comes closest among those I've played is Riener
Knizia's Ingenious. It's tie-break system feels natural and unified to
me.  I've played something like 250 times, and I'm amazed at the way
it has unfolded before me. On it's surface the game look so plain.

Relatedly, I love that...when the rules seem plain, and you don't even
understand how the game could be fun or even work, and it only makes
sense after playing.

(Relatedly relatedly, Mark, when you, an insightful dude when not
rhetorically strafing the unwashed masses, initially assumed that
Ketchup would devolve to meatballs, I got a little proud. I achieved
my goal: stupid-looking rules)

It's late and I'm monologuing. Forgive me and good night.
