If you consider the practical portions of the two game trees, it's possible
to sit down and play Go in a couple/few hours.  This isn't possible with
Go-sized Rive.  We're talking days/weeks/months/years.  In this sense, in
the practical play sense, Rive makes Go look like a smell molecule tenuously
attached to a fly speck.

I agree, but in the distinction between 'hard finite' and 'soft
finite' , the 'three teams comparison' comes in handy.
Hex is hard finite, Go is soft finite: to terminate at all, it is
dependent on the players' intentions. Played by team 2, a game of Go
might go on a long time, played by team 1 it would not terminate at
all.

Rive is special because it is hard finite yet would go on 'forever' on
a Go board.
