I response to a query, the game of checkers is played with
different rules in different countries.  The most organized
and international version is known as International Checkers,
and can be found under Polish Checkers in some Hoyles. It's
mahor differences from the kind most people play in the US are:

1) It's played on a 10 X 10 with 20 checkers to a side.

2) The men can only move forward as in straight checkers, but they
can also capture backwards.

3) The king can move an entire diagonal.  It can jump any enemy piece in
the diagonal that has an empty space immediately following, can continue
the move to any empty space beyond and continue to jump if from that
space it could jump another piece in a different diagonal (but not
reverse direction).

4) The move that captures most men is mandatory.

Many national versions follow rules 2 and 3 (and some times 4) but not 1.
The German version, for instance differs from the Russian in that in Germany
a man who lands in the last rank does not move as king until the next move
(and I believe must end the move in the last rank) whereas in Russia he 
continues to move as a king.  All these differences are in the 8 X 8 game, as
the 10 X 10 is standardized.  In Spanish speaking countries only rule 3)
applies.

What is interesting is that a version very close to what I have described
is the version played by the black community in the US.  Indeed, for years 
the US was represented in International checkers and pool checkers by
Carl "Buster" Smith, an Afro-American (I believe a postal worker) from
Chicago.  The the Russian immigration of the seventies brought a number 
of former Soviet players to the US and the picture changed a bit.  I have
not kept up with it.

I never sit to play checkers with a stranger without going over the rules,
particularly if the stranger is black or has a foreign accent.   I have seen
arguments at a park when two persons of different backgrounds sit to 
play, and each affirms vehemently that checkers is played their way.
 
Perhaps others can add to my account.
