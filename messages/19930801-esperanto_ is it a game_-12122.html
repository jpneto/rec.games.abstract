Hello.

I read in Kosinski's HERMIT OF 69th STREET that Esperanto has only
sixteen rules.

Could someone who knows them please e-mail them to me?  I think that
learning Esperanto would be a fun thing to have done.  Then I could take
advantiage of the wealth of great literature written in Esperanto, and have
deep philosophical discussions with other Esperin around the world.  Realizing
of course that library research would probably produce results more
quickly than this canvass of internet news during vacation, I nevertheless
forge ahead with this more amusing method of inquiry which if successful
should provide not just the cold knowledge of what those sixteen rules are,
but also a preliminary set of people with whom to converse in Esperanto.

Very truly and sincerely,
David Nicol; <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:DNICOL@vax1.umkc.edu">DNICOL@vax1.umkc.edu</a>
