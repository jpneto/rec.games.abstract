There has been much discussion on this group recently about the
"complexity" of a game.  The goal of this note is to start a
discussion about the important dimensions along which games could be
echaracterised, as they are related to the complexity of a game.

Search Complexity relates to properties like the branching factor and
number of possible positions.  Decision Complexity is much less
precise, but has to do with the likelihood that a game (or some set of
positions within it) could be <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>solved<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> even in spite of a high search
complexity.  As an example of low decision complexity, they imagine a
simplified version game of GO, which I will call TRIVIAL-GO, with the
following rules:

0. The game is played on a 19x19 GO board. 
1. Two players move in turn, starting with White.
2. For his move, a player may either <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>pass<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, or place a stone of his
color on an empty square.
3. The first player to have 181 stones on the board wins. 

While this game has roughly the same search complexity as GO, it is
obvious that a player should never pass, and that WHITE wins by always
placing a stone.  

Thus, it is clear that some measure in addition to search complexity
is necessary to characterize our intuive notion of game complexity.
Unfortunately, Decision Complexity has so far only been motivated by
example.  Instead I would like to find some game complexity measures
which are quantifiable, so that I could write a program to measure
candidate games along these dimensions.  I would be interested in
other people's suggestions for possible metrics of this kind.

I agree, how about a metric that measures the number of moves available that 
are effectively different.  This would rule out mirror image moves, equate
"wasted" moves (i.e. taking a hit in blackjack when you're already busted) and
attempt to reduce the complexity of the moves.  For example, in trivial GO 
there is effectively only two possible moves for each player on each turn.
This is realized when the "differentness" of the available moves is seen to
be non-existant.

3. Rule Complexity RULE(Game,L): 
The length of the smallest representation of the rules of the game in
a pre-specified game description language L.  Different choices of L
yield different rule complexities.  This brings up the question: "what
does it mean for some set of rules to be a representation of a game?"
I'll defer answering this question for this article, assuming that we
can agree when a program is really playing the game by the right
rules.

Measuring the complexity of the rules seems to be an extremely difficult task
and one without clear value.  Consider another version of Trivial-GO that had
extremely complex rules that calculated exactly one position that your 
opponent could not move based on your last move.  (Imagine something extremely
contrived and complex that relates the new number of pieces in your row, 
in your column, the total number of your pieces and your opponent's pieces in 
the four quadrants generated by your move.  Then imagine additional verbage 
describing what to do when the stone is placed on an edge or corner and there 
are degenerate quadrants, etc. ,etc.)  The rule would minutely limit the 
number of possible locations that a stone could be placed, but clearly not 
effect the overall outcome of the game.  The end result is the exactly the 
same as the original game (white never passes and always wins, but the rule 
metric has been made much more complex, while the state search space has only 
been reduced by a small amount.  Contrived as this is, I've seen games where 
the explanation of the rules becomes exponentially complex when discussing 
extremely rare situations and boundary conditions.

Some metric that short circuits this type of situation must be employed to
generate useful information about the relative complexity of different games.
