OK, I've read net resources, and Othello seems to turn out to be an
interesting game. I run into an advice that one should not take edges
too early. Why is it so?

One reason is that by having edges, you will tend to flip more
(exterior) discs on later moves, and thus ruin your mobility.
There is something called the OET (opposite edge theorem) that
says that having two opposite edges (i.e., north and south, or
east and west) is (particularly) bad.

It can happen that grabbing edges is just what you should do
to kill your opponent, because you run him out of moves (i.e.,
he has to give up a corner). But it is important to know what
you're doing - if the plan fails you may soon find yourself
with too many discs.
