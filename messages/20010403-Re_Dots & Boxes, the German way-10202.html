I discovered/invented  a few games in my life such as:

1. "Pantherk�stchen" (German Dots &amp; Boxes or "K�sek�stchen" for advanced
players)
2. "Netak" (a card game which is played on an imaginary board with one to
possibly more than  100 players. Some games took months to complete. A pure
game of skill deeper than Go or Chess).
3. Magnetgo (internationally known as "electric Go", -- i was quite
astonished when i learned that there were Magnetgo tournaments in the USA
and at the European Go Congress)
4. "Dornr�schendame" ("Sleeping Beauty Draughts"; a nice Draughts variant
that cannot end in a draw)
5. "Walking Purchase" (named in honor of the Lenape nation)

Where can we read the rules to these games?
