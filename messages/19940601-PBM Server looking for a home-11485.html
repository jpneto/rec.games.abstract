Greetings!

I have been developing a generic PBeM Server on a host that has no 
net access.  I have access to the net via NETCOM.COM, but have been
having difficulty getting them to setup an method of getting mail to the
server (without it clogging my own mail box).  I do not wish to spend
an additional $xx/month to pay for a second shell account.  Therefore, I
am looking for some soul (or souls) who might be willing to allow me a 
shell account on their system to act as the home of this server.

My requirements on the target system are:
	A shell account for the PBeM Server
	Access to a C compiler
	That's it.  Any mail received by the Server will be processed
	by its .forward.  I would rlogin to the system to perform
	maintenance and/or ftp files to it from here.

So far, I have implemented some administrative functions, and a Trax
server (similar to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:munch@soda.berkeley.edu">munch@soda.berkeley.edu</a>), however, I play to implement
a number of other games in the near future as time allows including, but
not limited to:
	Abalone	- hexagon board with marbles.  push your opponent off the
		board
	Ataxx	- take over territory by growing/jumping about the board,
		and flipping any adjacent pieces to your color.
	GNU-Robots - King of the Hill tournament (ala Corewar) in which
		robots are programmed in GNU-C/C++ and placed in an arena
		to fight it out.
	Twixt	- connect your side of the board with preventing your
		opponent from doing same.
	Terrace	- StarTrek: the Next Generation (10-forward) game.

It is still in it's infancy, so I am open to suggestions...
