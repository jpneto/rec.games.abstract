Of course, Crossway isn't broken. It's too technically similar to Hex
for that. But neither is it particularly interesting for players (due
to its gameplay similarity to far more popular connection games).

Deductive predictions of behaviour can be made to a degree. It's easy
to see, without ever having played, that Hex and Crossway will 'work'
and that both can be balanced to a degree by using the pie rule. But
considering the level of play displayed (pun intended) by the top
players, a level I couldn't aspire to, yet understand because I'm a
Havannah player, then I'm in awe. Looking at Crossway I see a tactical
haywire that, for me at least, is in severe opposition to Hex' clarity
and it's space for strategical planning.

A point in case: Query (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/">http://mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/</a>
query-548) has actually never been playtested. It's based on the
"it'll work" approach and published because I had other babies to take
care of. As far as I can see, it also compares unfavorably to Hex, but
I see no reason to dismiss it for that alone. Whether it has a
sufficient degree of clarity to allow strategic planning, and/or
whether it is fun, remains to be seen.
