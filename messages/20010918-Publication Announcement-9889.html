This posting heralds the publication by Yutopian
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.yutopian.com/go">http://www.yutopian.com/go</a>) of my new primer GO FOR KIDS (ISBN#
1-889554-74-X), a uniquely child-friendly introduction to the 4000
year old Strategic Board Game known as Go in the Western World, Igo in
Japan, Baduk in Korea, and WeiQi in China.

If you already play Go you may prefer to skip directly to the section
of this memo entitled "How Can I Best Learn Go?" below.

Readers not acquainted with Go will find that what follows provides
more than ample justification for learning more about it.

Why Everyone Should Be Interested In Learning The Game Of Go 

Those who play strategic board games or who engage in similar
intellectual pursuits (e.g. card games, Mah Jong, etc.) recognize that
a few certain key elements are what make such an activity challenging
and capable of sustaining that interest over the long haul. These are:
simple, easily comprehensible structure, rules and objective; sharp,
incisive tactics; profound strategy; and unconstrained opportunity for
the exercise of the player's initiative and judgment. And of all of
the games in human history, including Chess, Bridge, and others,  only
the 4000 year old oriental strategic board game called Go (WeiQi in
China, Baduk in Korea, and Igo in Japan) fully satisfies all of these
criteria.

Go is not only endlessly fascinating, but occupies a unique place as
one of the most challenging and sublime creations of the human
intellect in all of recorded history! Equally important to those of
you who are concerned with education is the fact that it provides the
ideal mechanism for teaching vital Reasoning Skills!  (For more
information on this important topic please see the extensive
discussion in my web page, whose URL appears below my signature.)

Beyond even these almost transcendentally important assets, Go has
another extraordinary characteristic of truly immense value! Unlike
Chess, which for all its reputation is not the perfect strategic board
game because it's largely analytic, Go uniquely and completely
integrates analytic (left brain) and artistic/pattern recognition
(right brain) function in a manner unequaled by any other known
mechanism!

One astonishing result of this integration of brain function was
reported by William S. Cobb in his regular column "The Empty Board" in
the American Go Journal, Vol. 34, #3, Fall 2000, as follows:

"Last June (I visited) Japan to participate in a symposium on the
educational benefits of teaching Go in schools. .......  On this trip
I discovered that the Japanese have become seriously interested in the
possibilities of using Go as a therapy for people with mental
problems."

And Cobb goes on to say:

"In recent years, Dr. Kaneko Mitsuo, a Japanese neurosurgeon with an
international reputation, has been working with older people suffering
from senile dementia. Using PET scans he has shown that there is
substantial area of the right brain that begins to atrophy in people
who suffer from dementia. This turns out to be essentially the same
part of the brain that is most active when engaging in musical
activities and in playing Go. To research this further, Dr. Kaneko has
been teaching Go to patients in the beginning stages of dementia. (He)
is now convinced that learning to play Go can reverse the development
of dementia in virtually all patients in the beginning stages of the
disease. Of course, this does not apply to Alzheimer's, which is still
an incurable condition, but it does work for common dementia."

Augmenting these findings, an article I read a number of years earlier
described a medical study of professional Go players in Japan and
reported that they typically had a far lower incidence of Alzheimer's
Disease than non Go players! Perhaps even more amazing, according to
this same article these Go professionals were also found to have a
demonstrably faster and far more complete recovery from strokes than
"ordinary" citizens of otherwise comparable age and background! (Their
recovery of motor and cognitive function was comparable to that of
ambidextrous people, even though they were not!)

These things alone surely should provide sufficient incentive for you
to investigate Go further, but there are more, and to many minds even
better, reasons!

Those who play Go do so because they find that meeting its unique and
profound intellectual challenges is FUN!  But I wrote my primer GO FOR
KIDS primarily because I've come to believe that everyone - and
especially children -  can profit from learning Go because of its
unique ability to improve one's vital Reasoning Skills. My web page
supplies the rationale for this belief in far greater detail than is
feasible here, so if this is an area of interest to you please read
that rather extensive discussion.

What Makes Go So Interesting?

NOTE: Because chess has the (as I shall demonstrate, undeserved)
reputation in western societies as the unparalleled strategic board
game, I shall use it as the basis for comparison in the discussion
that follows. Apologies to those who prefer other games.

Constructed from only the simplest elements of a vast, empty 19x19
line ruled board and white and black undifferentiated lens shaped
playing pieces which are simply placed and then not moved, Go has only
a few elegant rules and no complex piece moves to master. This is in
sharp contrast to all chess variants, which are characterized by a
tiny board, a fixed and restrictive starting lineup, and a
multiplicity of different piece moves (plus, in Western Chess, such
added- on complications as promotion, castling, the "en passant"
capture, etc.). The fixed starting lineup severely restricts the
chessplayer's freedom to structure the game according to his own
strategic plans, and the bewildering multiplicity of piece moves and
special rules make getting started in Chess complicated and often
intimidating.

Of course these same complications provide Chess with its unique
flavor and much of its  attractiveness to its many adherents, while in
contrast Go players revel in their game's spare and elegant
simplicity. So which game one prefers or if one likes both equally is
a matter of taste with which there really can be no valid argument.

But one unquestioned advantage Go does have over Chess is its integral
handicap system, which allows players at widely different skill levels
to have truly competitive games without the strategic distortion that
accompanies odds giving in Chess. Another significant advantage of Go,
especially to the tournament player is the absence of the annoying
draws so common in high level chess!

And there is another even more  important area in which Go clearly has
no equal and which sets it apart from chess or any other game - its
profound and subtle overall strategy that ultimately structures and
dominates strong play! Coupled with the scintillating and incisive
tactical action that is invariably integral to the implementation of
those strategic goals, this combination of assets impels Go to a
degree of subtlety and depth at least an order of magnitude beyond
Chess!.

Unfortunately, most chessplayers confronted with these facts find it
almost inconceivable that any game could be superior to their favorite
and typically dispute that contention vehemently, but in defense of
its validity I quote from two of the most famous Chessplayers of all
time:

In about 1915 Richard Teichmann said: "Tactics is 99% of Chess."

And in his 1945 book "Chess Marches On" Grandmaster Reuben Fine said: 
".....most games, even between the greatest of the great, are decided
by tactics or combinations which have little or nothing to do with the
fundamental structure of the game."

This is directly at variance with Go where even the best tactics
employed without a deep strategic motivation have repeatedly been
demonstrated to fail completely against competent opposition. Given
this explicit acknowledgment of the strategic limitations of Chess by
those who know it best, there really should be no dispute regarding
the absolute superiority of Go! But despite these facts most
chessplayers still find that reality hard to accept, so to help
understand why it's true let's briefly compare the structure of the
two games.

A Chess game is logically analogous to a single great battle in which
the loss of a piece or even a  pawn usually spells inevitable defeat
against competent opposition. In contrast,  a game of Go simulates an
entire multi-front war in which many battles are going on
simultaneously, with constant trade-offs and interactions between them
taking place.. So, given proper strategy and execution, in Go it is
possible to lose battle after battle, yet through clever global
exploitation of those local defeats still ultimately prevail overall!

Where Chess essentially is a "winner take all"contest, a Go game
closely analogizes a "market share" business model in which victory
may be achieved by the slimmest margin of only a fraction of a percent
(a single point)! And in contrast to the annoying and all too frequent
occurrence of draws in Chess, especially at the Grandmaster level,
every Go game ends in a decision!

It is this unique combination of assets that makes Go unquestionably
the best of all the world's great strategic board games!

If Go Is So Good, Why Haven't I Heard Of It Before?
 
Go was first introduced into Germany from Japan about 125 years ago,
not too long after Japan was opened to Western contact in 1857 by
Commodore Perry after centuries of isolation. In 1913, primarily
through the efforts of Grandmaster Edward Lasker and World Chess
Champion Emanuel Lasker, Go migrated from Germany to the United
States. (This fascinating story is presented in the section of my web
page entitled "How Go Came To America".)

But for more than 40 years after that introduction, lasting until the
post WW II period, the spread of the oriental game of Go in the USA
and other technologically advanced Western nations was severely
inhibited by the then widely held (but as we now realize quite
mistaken) belief that all things oriental were backward and inferior.

In common with both Laskers and many in the western world I came to Go
through Chess! Back in 1950, as a member of the world famous Marshall
Chess Club in New York I had the good fortune to encounter both Go and
Dr. Edward Lasker because at that time the NY Go Club met in the
Marshall's facilities as a result of his membership in both
organizations.

But Go still languished in almost complete obscurity in most of the
western world and it wasn't until the startling rise of Japan, Taiwan
and Korea as technologically advanced and economically powerful
societies in the later post - WW II period that our misperceptions
about the Orient finally changed sufficiently to allow the creation of
the intellectual climate in which Go could really flourish here! And
it is only now, with the advent and startling growth of the internet,
that there finally exists the ideal mass communications medium with
which to complete that task!

Is Go Easy To Learn?

As with most things in the real world, even the incomparable assets of
Go don't come without some resulting liabilities! Perhaps Go's major
detriment is that its strategy is so subtle and profound that
understanding it is a skill not often easily acquired.  The applicable
proverb is: "Learn in 30 minutes, take 30 years to perfect the art"!
The compensation is that, if you enjoy using your mind to its fullest
doing so is not only FUN, but presents an ever fresh series of
stimulating challenges!

On the other hand, for most people of average intellect, the proverb
"Play 1000 games and become Shodan" (first degree amateur Go expert)
also applies. The only caveat is that those games must be played
against competent opposition from whom you can learn proper strategy
and technique, and not just against other beginners from whom you
essentially won't learn much more than to refine and reinforce your
errors!

How Can I Best Learn Go? 

My primer GO FOR KIDS, whose publication this missive announces, was
designed to finally provide the optimal answer to that age old
question!  It does this by virtue of its unique blend of 427
child-friendly cartoon panels coupled with incisive highlights of key
strategic and tactical ideas, illustrated with 340 diagrams and
accompanying explanatory text. The result is a Go primer that is
unique and better than any prior introduction to this paragon of
strategic board games, for both youngsters and adults.

For some small idea of how pleasantly and efficiently the unique
approach of GO FOR KIDS works, please refer to the final section of my
web page in which its rationale is provided together with the cover
and the complete 9 cartoon panel Introduction, exactly as it appears
in the book!

What Do Those Who've Seen GO FOR KIDS Say About it?

After completing his proofreading chore, one of the vetters for GO FOR
KIDS said: "I think it's a great combination of gameboard lesson,
engaging narrative in the cartoon panels, and 'headlined' points for
quickly getting and remembering key rules/concepts. I wish this had
been one of the first books I had read on the subject. I'm now going
through it a second time with my six year old. "

A second vetter said: "Thanks for letting me read through this, it was
fascinating.  I think you did a good job of writing out the rules in
plain language, though - without knowing the average 6th grader - I
will hazard a guess that they might need to get help from a parent for
a few words or concepts in the book. Well, you only learn by being
challenged, and especially with the lovely cartoons and "roleplaying"
that are presented, this seems to be a nice non-threatening way of
doing it.  Especially with heading off the "Why can't we do this now?"
questions at the pass. Oh, and as a final note, I agree that even
adults will find this useful, not insulting.  I definitely got a bit
of enlightenment out of it - specifically, that is in the order of
priorities for consideration and plays."

A third vetter summed up his comments even more succinctly by calling
GO FOR KIDS "superb"!

After you have looked at the GO FOR KIDS section of my web page I'm
confident that you will want to go to Yutopian
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.yutopian.com/go">http://www.yutopian.com/go</a>) or to your favorite local bookseller and
pick up your own copy, as well as one for each of your children,
relatives, friends and everyone else on your gift list! It will open a
window to a unique and wondrously intriguing new intellectual activity
which can light and transform all your lives, as it has for so many
others over the millennia. I'm confident that you will be forever glad
if you do!
