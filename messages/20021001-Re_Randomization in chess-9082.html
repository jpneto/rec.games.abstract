For me, there is plenty of subjective probability in chess without adding objective randomness. I'm interested in improving game analysis. From
the computer side, adding randomness may allow one to achieve better evaluation functions (analogous to the successful evaluations of backgammon
programs), and possibly more effective search techniques (analogous to rollouts). From the human side, I'd bet that the analysis returned by the
computer would make more sense, and would lead to easier generalizations.

This all makes sense to me now. Thanks for the clarification.
I think you're right. Although, I know little about how how to go 
about programming these Chess games and what systems are already 
involved in calculating the moves. It seems they must have some 
way of calculating the odds that you will make one move or another. 
If they do this, then it might be interesting if they could adjust 
to a person's playing ability when calculating the odds based on 
how the person had played the game up to that point. 

For example, if someone had made many poor moves, then it might 
have more to consider due to the fact that there could be a wider
range of likely moves that the person might choose. An advanced 
player would be more likely to see the one or two best moves and 
focus attention on the select "best" moves that would follow which 
would limit the number of moves that the person would likely choose. 
This would seemingly allow the computer to "focus" more and "work" 
less...?

My guess is that my thoughts here are somewhat naive, in that the 
computers are probably already doing all that and more in 100th of 
a second.
