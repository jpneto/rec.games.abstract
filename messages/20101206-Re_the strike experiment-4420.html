I like the idea. It is without doubt 'organic', an infectious stone
targeting groups that have a matching size &amp; distance. That's its
basic fighting mechanism.

My first question regarding 'organic' mechanisms is always: what does
it want?
This one doesn't have a mechanism to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>eliminate<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> an opponent, so
'something territorial' would come to mind.
The bigger a group, the harder it becomes to attack (with the required
increasing distance), but also the more dramatic if the opponent
succeeds in doing so. Territorial and dramatic, that's a good match.
But then territory might lead to the type of endgame you'd rather
avoid.

My point is (I think) that you should 'communicate' with the core of
the organism about its 'object'. If you can get that clear, the rules,
in my experience, will follow almost implicitly. Don't focus too much
on details because they depend on the object.

I don't like the 10+ rule all that much, especially in a game that has
a 'striking distance' of the LOA type. To set a hard wired object on
top of this elegance is, well, not elegant.

I'd look for something else to get it finite before the board is full.
