In fact, I first had the idea for this game more or less when Pylyx
was released. I inexplicably threw it away without even testing it in
the belief that a) it couldn't be so easy to fish in a river from
which LoA, Teeko and Pylyx had already been taken away, and b) there
would be too much counting involved in the mechanism. However, none of
these out to be the case in any way, as a) I fished an ayu ;-) and b)
with the suggested board size, and even with bigger ones, you'll
usually be able to check out at a glance which unit is closest to the
moving one. Relevant distances between 1 and 3 points are by far the
most usual, and higher ones only really show up quite later in the
game, when there are just a few large groups on the board and the fog
has already cleared.

Be that as it may, I took the idea up again out of dissatisfaction
with Raindrops, a derivation which, though quite playable, turned out
to be too volatile and tactical for my taste. This one improves on it
by being a much more positional game.

Thanks, Mark. I'd rather say ala Monkey Queen, from which I borrowed
the concept of moving always closer to some other pieces. My
acknowledgements to you for that. The definition of "distance" (also
in Cage) is different, though.

Now that's surprising! I'm also considering Slide, Gather and Swarm as
possible names. I was leaning towards Gather, but my English
dictionary says it also means "to form pus". Arrghh! :-(
