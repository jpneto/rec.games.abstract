&lt;&lt;  progressive chess goes 1 move, 2 moves, 3 moves, 4, 5, 6, 7...
  has there been any research on 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...?  it isnt
  clear to me was the progressive chess tempo advantage is.  if
  just count the cumulative moves, it goes 1-0, 1-2, 4-2, 4-6,
  9-6, 9-12, 16-12, 16-20....but defending for an 8-move turn
  must be a nightmare.  with 1,2,2,2,2...the analysis paralysis
  problem may be held under control.  however, this fairy chess
  version may have already been shown to lead to an unsatisfactory
  game in the past. &gt;&gt;

Progressive chess has been played a lot and is alive and well.  White
has an advantage, but no larger than in regular chess.  The 1,2,2,...
move pattern is used in Marseillais Chess and Balanced Doublemove
chess, both of which have been played quite a bit and are excellent
variants.  It is also used in Doublemove Go, an interesting Go variant
that hasn't been played enough.  And I'm sure there are other games
that can be played with this pattern.
