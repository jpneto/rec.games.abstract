Hello, Everyone:

By now and worldwide, many people can manage to solve the famous 3x3x3
Rubik's Cube. However, most of them learned to do so either from
friends, books, or the Internet. Personally, I feel it is very
difficult to figure it out by oneself. So I am wondering what
percentage of the people who can solve it now actually worked it out
independently, i.e.,  without external help of any sort. If you don't
have the statistics, can you make just a wild guess?

Thank you for reading!

--Roland
