Isn't that a paradox? Treating other designers a priori as equals is
offensive to you, and yet you're discussing it.

Our community is microscopic, virtually ignored by anyone outside it.
No participant ever had commercial success with their games - despite
many trying, including you and Steere.

To expect admiration and deference in such a context is eccentric. But
you are at least reasonably polite about it, unlike some others I
could mention.

Do your contribution to the r.g.c competition still stand?
