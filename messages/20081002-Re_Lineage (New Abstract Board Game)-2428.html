Do you think it is likely that having an online community of gamers
will translate into game sales? I am worried that perhaps people will
only play the game online, considering, as you have stated, that they
probably will not be able to find others in their area to play the
game with.

Yes, it may happen. Of the games I mentioned, I suspect many are
almost never played over the board. But Hive and the Gipf series are.
I would say it depends on your distribution channels. If you only sell
it through your website, I think it won't get much of an over the
board community (outside of where you live, possibly).

If this is the case, my board game may end up turning into just an
online game, with ads to supply revenue, instead of sales.

I think this may be a good idea. It is certainly a lot less risky than
trying to get your board for sale in boardgame stores. But keep
selling boards from your site, too, if you can.

Yes, just having an online game would definitely save me from the risk
of not being able to recover from manufacturing costs. But also, I
doubt ads will be able to generate much money at all, unless a website
has a very large number of visitors.

I will have to figure out what I want to do with my game, but I think
that at some point I will want to get it manufactured and actually go
for assembling an over-the-board community.

Hmm...

Thanks for the advice, you've given me some good insight into the
industry.
