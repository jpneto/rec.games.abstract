I invented the concept of capturing differently : one player can capture only vertically and his opponent vertically. Why is it interesting to break the capture in two? I let you answer to this question. We can use other dimensions (up-down, orthogonal-diagonal or any other binary dimension.
In Hex game there is no capture at all.

Carteso doesn't use that capturing method because there is no capture in Carteso.

Trick of the thieves.
Read this :A group, regardless of color, is owned by Vertical if it spans more rows than columns, and by Horizontal if it spans more columns than rows.. If a group spans exactly as many rows as columns, it's owned by neither player.

What is owning versus capturing?
When you flip a token in Othello is similar to capturing it.
When you control a territory is similar to capturing land.
In any case you will finish by vomiting your theft.
You know why?
Because my concept does not fit with such crappy game Cartezero. Even i you revised it as you wish it will remain botched game.
