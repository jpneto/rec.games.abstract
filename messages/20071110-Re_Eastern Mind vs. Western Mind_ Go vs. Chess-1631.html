<br>Agreed. In any case, the difference between Go and Chess is not that 
between east and west, since both are of Asiatic origin. Furthermore, 
Chess, in one form or another, remains pretty well the national game of 
Asia. While both are equally Asiatic, Wei-qi (the ancestor of Japanese 
Go) is more specifically Chinese, so the contrast is between China and 
the rest of Asia rather than between Asia and the west. Indeed, until 
about the middle of the 19th century "The West" has hardly come up with 
any original game of its own.

<br>The you for taking the time to read and reply to my post.
<br>
<br>The observation that both Chess and Go come from Asia, if I may say so, 
misses the point. Chess, regardless of where it comes from, is more of a 
"force on force" game that is more commonly popular in the West, and in 
particularly in America, where such games as football and boxing have 
helped shape the popular imagination and given us metaphors for war and 
other forms of conflict.
<br>
<br>In contrast, Go, a territorial game of maneuver, has had a hold on Asia 
that Xiangqi, Shogi and international Chess have never attained 
historically. Businessmen of Japan and military leaders of China often 
express their strategies in terms of Go whereas their American 
counterparts would never do so.
<br>
<br>Is it a mere coincidence that many American businesses do not look 
beyond the next quarterly report and that many Asian business are 
renowned for developing business plans that stretch over years and decades?
<br>
<br>So, yes, to answer your question, Chinese Chess is less Eastern than Go 
because it represents a "force on force" paradigm that has not been as 
influential as the territory/maneuver paradigm of Go in China. The 
former paradigm is predominant in the West in general, and in America in 
particular.
<br>
<br>I look forward to your reply.
