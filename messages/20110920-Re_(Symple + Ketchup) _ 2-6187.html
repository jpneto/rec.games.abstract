Still alive! Sorry for the extreme delay in answering. I've been away
from abstract games last days.

Nick, you're right in your analysis of the problems arising with the
Ketchup goal.

In contrast, using the Symple goal, as I originally suggested, isn't
devoid of problems, either. The negative feedback seems too low:
extending a group can help you save four points (assuming 4 is the
group penalty), while it costs only one in return (the extra stone
played by the opponent). So you'll usually find yourself extending
your groups without worrying too much about negative feedback. Compare
it to what happens in Symple, where an extra group can bring you many
points throughout the game, and so will likely compensate for the
penalty.

For this game to work (let's name it Growers), it seems that the
number of extra placements which are given to the opponent in return
for extending groups should be about equal to the group penalty.
Instead of two to one (placing two stones and giving one extra
placement to the opponent when extending a group), it could be made
one to two, for instance, always with a group penalty of four. This
must be an improvement.

But it would be even better if a goal were found where the number of
stones at the end of the game were unimportant. That way, the negative
feedback would be purely positional, and the strategic dilemma between
extending groups or not could be much more interesting.

As you have already said,

while the Hex connection goal is horrifically unoriginal, combined with
your feedback mechanism it might [...] make an exquisite game.

But I also agree that, ideally,

I'd like to think of an original win condition which is the natural
conclusion to a game with your mechanism.

So I'll keep working.
