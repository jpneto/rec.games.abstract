Anyone want to discuss approaches to designing Othello playing programs?
What strategies might be used to overcome Othello's reputed insusceptibility

I've never heard of this.  I would say the opposite: Othello is one of the
best-suited games for state-space (tree) search.  It has a manageable
branching factor and static evaluation functions do pretty well.  The Othello
programs I've heard of perform tree search, and the best Othello programs are
about on par with the best humans now.

I'd heard someone mention in passing that there were some static evaluation
problems.  What is the math on the branching factor?

It would be interesting to see a planning approach for Othello (or for any
game), but I don't know of any good (ie, non-research) game programs that
do any kind of abstract planning.

Do you know of any references to designing planning approaches?  Anyone have
any ideas?  How about genetic algorithms, or anything interesting like that?

What computer program competitions are held for Othello programs in the US?
