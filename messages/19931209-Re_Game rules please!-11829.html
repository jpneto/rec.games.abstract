This may seem like a silly request, but I just bought a 4 pack of
games as a gift and they don't come with instructions. I need 
game rules for Chess, Checkers, Backgammon, and Chinese Checkers.
Please e-mail me with these or with information on how to get
them. Thanks! :-)

It's not a silly request but it turns out to be a silly place to
post it.  (Well, you learn something new everyday! ;-) )  Classic
abstract games such as checkers have their own newsgroup - rec.games.abstract.
Chess and backgammon have their own groups.  I have set the newsgroups
line to crosspost to these groups so the experts will have a chance to
see your request.

If it were me, I'd go to a bookstore and see if there's some sort of
"common games rules according to Hoyle" kind of book there.  I'll bet
you'd have several to choose from.  Or go to a library reference desk and
ask the person there to help you.  They will likely find you something for
each of these games you could xerox off for a nickle a page.  Good luck.
