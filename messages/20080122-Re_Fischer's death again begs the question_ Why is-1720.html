I have asked this before on here I believe.  Well, the death of
Fischer begs the question once more.  I also posted this on Boardgame

Please don't get me started about American Gladiator being back, or

Come on! All this and no chess?

If chess was on TV, I don't know that I would watch the show.  I find
most TV is irritating anyways.  I prefer how it is now, you can watch
the game live on websites with GM's kibitzing (and many patzers too :)
Also for TV you need real 'characters'... chess players are generally
very introspective people who 'play the board'.  Unlike poker where
acting ability increases your chance of winning thus producing many
'characters'.

If "characters" is what matters, then that explains the popularity of
chess during Bobby Fischer.

When Karpov was playing Kasparov, my dad rooted for Kasparov, because
of his more interesting playing style. Character can also show on the
board, but unfortunately that's lost on the average viewer. I remember
a really psychological game of go between two Dutch champions, which
was extremely exciting if you knew what was going on, but to most
people it's just a lot of black and white stones on a board.
