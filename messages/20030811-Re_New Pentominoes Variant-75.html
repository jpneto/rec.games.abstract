For some reason, I did not see Torben's reply to
my original message.  If there was substantially
more to it, would someone please re-post?  Thanks
a lot.  (Alternatively, if it shows up on Google
I'll read it there.)

 BASIC RULES

 The pentomino pieces are put into a "pool" accessible
to both players.  Players alternate turns.
 On a player's turn, he takes a piece from the "pool"
and places it in any empty area on the board.
 The first player to be unable to place a piece
on the board loses the game.

Yep.  Martin Gardner wrote about it circa 1976, and he
got it from someone else, and so on.

It is definitely possible to have a never-ending game if both
players are cooperating, just like it's possible to have a
never-ending game of chess.  But I don't think such a game is
likely to happen in the real world, just as chess tournaments
probably don't end in stalemates all that often.  A chess-like
rule could be added - say, if one player suggests a draw, and
the other player has not won in 10 moves from that point, then
the game is over.

I hate games where you "can't repeat a position."  Who has room
in their brains for the past 10 or 20 board positions to avoid,
when you're in the middle of a challenging mind game anyway?
If I wanted to remember positions, I'd play "Concentration." ;-)

Another variant of the basic rules is to use a standard 8x8 checker
board and let one player play white and the other black.  Play is as
the basic rules (place pentominoes until no further move is
possible), but let the winner be the player with most squares of his
own colour uncovered at the end of the game.

Interesting, but probably <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>much<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> easier to analyze.  I know that
circa 1976 the classic Pentominoes game had been completely solved
up to the 5x5 board, and I would imagine it's up to the 7x7 or 8x8
by now.

What I tried to do with my variation was to introduce the possibility
(absent in Gardner's game and your variation) of games' lasting longer
than 6 moves for either player.  I'm a "middle game" sort of player;
I like games that involve moderately dynamic boards.  With regular
Pentominoes, the game ends before you can really get into it; and
[therefore] a decent "opening book" probably wins the game right off.

The idea here was to make a game that was not as susceptible to
naive analysis, and to make one that could be played over and over
with lots of dynamism (if that's a word :) and variation.

In addition, the W placed in a corner can cover 3:2, and

If the other player gives the first player a piece that
