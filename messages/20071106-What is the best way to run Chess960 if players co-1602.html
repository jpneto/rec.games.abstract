Just curious here.  Because Chess960 is a bit cumbersome to run
manually with having the set up randomized (and also Combinatorial
purists get upset over it), I was curious what would be the best way
to run Chess960 where players control the placement of pieces and have
an pre-opening before the game begins.  As of now, going to give this
version the name Thompson Chess960 (or IAGO Standard Chess960).

Anyone know what the best way for players to be able to place pieces,
as far as turn order? Like, do you start with Bishops and white and
black alternate, then rooks, and so on? Or do you have one player
place both bishops, then other player places both knights?  Or would
putting any piece down be the best way, so long as it meets the
criterion?

Please post any ideas you may have here, or any known best way to do
this.

Thanks...
- Rich
