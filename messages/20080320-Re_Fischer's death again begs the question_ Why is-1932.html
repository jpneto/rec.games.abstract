<br><blockquote type=cite>Losing on purpose is a far bigger moral step. There are very few
<br>documented cases of thrown games.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Except I quoted one study which shows it happens in sumo. You
<br>don't need to identify which are the thrown games, just show that
<br>statistically quite a few clearly are.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Changing the
<br>scoring is one way to address that defect.
<br></blockquote>
<br>You just don't get it. Changing the scoring system (which addresses a
<br>problem the people who actually matter don't seem to mind, but no
<br>matter) would makes cheating profitable. Mathematical fact.
<br></blockquote>
<br>It is a "mathematical fact" that cheating is already profitable in chess. Your
<br>theory has to address this, but doesn't.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Where
<br>cheating is profitable, people will find a way to cheat. Pretty much the
<br>definition of the human condition, with mountains of supporting
<br>evidence.
<br>
<br></blockquote>
<br>Except that there aren't mountains of evidence that cheating occurs
<br>in chess, unless you count the morally/legally ambiguous issue of agreed
<br>draws (a problem which would clearly be lessened by scoring
<br>changes - using the same kind of logic you&nbsp; are using)
<br>You can't pick and chose the data you want to look at.
<br>
<br>I'll grant that I don't know about sumo. Can you summarize?
<br>I suspect that there are many differences making the analogy
<br>very weak, but I'm open to being convinced.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>But arguing with you is a waste of time, I'll take someone else's
<br>earlier advice to give it up.
<br></blockquote>
<br>In tournaments that have used alternate scoring, there have
<br>been no accusations of cheating. There were, however, a
<br>higher than normal percentage of highly contested games.
<br>Inconvenient facts, I know.
