There is a positive correlation.  But there is even more evidence
that intelligence is multidimensional, and that people can do well
in one area without doing well in another.

There is also evidence that continual work is very bad
for the bright, and that drill after moderate mastery is
almost completely counterproductive.  If we could do it,
I would like to remove anyone who would consider giving
someone who understands something routine problems from
education entirely.

At best, it is that those who CAN do well at a calculus
course which emphasizes understanding and downplays
manipulation can also do well at abstract mathematics, but
this is not necessary, and there are those who can do well
at abstract ideas, not tested by intelligence tests, and
poorly tested at best, but who do nowhere near as well at
routine manipulation.

    An outstanding mathematician once said that no one <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> understands
introductory calculus, since all that has to be done is to learn the
different patterns.   Of course, there are a few real proofs, say
epsilon-delta stuff, but most of it is just taken on faith.   And I believe
modern textbooks tend to eliminate the proofs entirely.   Isn't this right?

Also, the converse direction holds.  Those who could
understand abstract mathematics could teach children those
concepts in the "new math", but the teachers were totally
unable to handle them.

    And the books themselves were awful too, as the authors plainly did not
understand the concepts themselves.

Those who can understand it SHOULD get through the whole
sequence with VERY little work.  And they should get a
full-blown real analysis course instead, with calculus
as an application.  Who needs to know how to calculate
derivatives and anti-derivatives?  Only theoreticians
need this; the one applying it can use tools.  But we
have many examples of excellent mathematicians who have
difficulty with such manipulations.

    Are you suggesting that a "full-blown analysis course" should be taught
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>instead<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of introductory calculus?   At what level?   To Freshmen?

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Understanding needs to precede manipulation, or only
the extremely bright can understand it.  Yes, the geniuses
can understand mathematics after manipulation, if they are
not driven off by the boredom, and if they are not also
driven out for low grades due to not handing in busy work.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

    This seems backwards to me.   Manipulation is required by some extent to
everyone.   An example here and there are essential.   I can't believe you
asserted that one could just "understand" without <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> context of
examples.   Surely your many years of teaching clearly establishes this
need.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
But why subject them to the junk?  Even the moderately
good ones can learn mathematics faster without it, and
then learn the manipulative material twice as fast,
because they will understand what they are doing.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

    I'm not sure I'm following.   Are you saying that somehow the
"understanding" is somehow just given to the student in the absence of any
manipulation at all?   You can't be saying this!

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
This is exactly the opposite.  We can teach abstract
mathematics, involving thinking, to children who can
just read.  Every year in the present schools serves
to stultify the innate ability to think abstractly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

    Too general for comment.   My experience is that if you leave everything
in the abstract, students learn to talk <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>as if<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> they know something--like
educators using fancy sounding words.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Teaching reading by the whole word method, besides wasting
years, seems to have reduced or even destroyed the ability
of a substantial proportion of children to use the alphabet
to pronounce words.

The schools provide almost completely bad teaching; one
can teach elementary school children about the integers
from first principles, but after being told that the
integers are learned by memorizing methods of computing
sums and products, it is a major problem.  Preschoolers
understand grammatical structure; college students
usually do not.

    Hard to disagree with the above.

And keeping a child who can learn more in a dumbed-down
class cannot have any good effect whatever.

    Ditto.

Those who can think abstractly, and I believe that this
is most, are born that way.  It can be knocked out.
