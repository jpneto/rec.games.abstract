If there was, Mark would likely get himself kicked off it, due to the
number of complaints generated by his insulting and demeaning attitude
he has had towards anyone he disagrees with.  Usenet's
rec.games.abstract is a refuge for Mark, because he has a hard time
finding anyone left who would listen to him and what he has to say.
Maybe the entire goal is to prove how good his games are by being as
nasty of a person as possible.  If his games catch on despite him,
maybe that means something.

There is a moderated group dedicated to abstract strategy games on
Yahoo.  That may be a start.

I don't show up here very often, but I thought I'd jump in to say this
to Rich and James re moderation.  The world does not need another
place where thought police and control freaks determine what people
can say.  The world needs places where people can say what they damn
well please and if you don't like it you can fight back, ignore, or go
somewhere else.
