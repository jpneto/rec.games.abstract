Hi. I'm interested to various abstract games, and recently I saw an
interesting card game with perfect information, Whistette, invented in
1929 by the chess player Lasker: here is some paper about it:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/p8j202484g679322/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/p8j202484g679322/</a>

In 1929 Emanuel Lasker, the mathematician and world chess champion,
described a two person constant sum perfect information game, which he
called whistette. The game uses a deck of cards that consists of a
single totally ordered suit of 2n cards. To begin play the deck is
divided into two hands A and B of n cards each, held by players Left
and Right, and one player is designated as having the lead. The player
on lead chooses one of his cards, and the other player after seeing
this card selects one of his own to play. The player with the higher
card wins a "trick" and obtains the lead. The cards in the trick are
removed from each hand, and play then continues until all cards are
exhausted. Each player strives to maximize (or minimize, in the misère
version) his trick total, and the value of the game to each player is
the number of tricks he takes under optimal play. While we have found
an optimal strategy for the misère version, the regular game remains
unsolved in general. In previous papers we derived basic properties of
the regular game, found criteria under which one hand is guaranteed to
be better than another, and determined the value functions in several
special cases. In this paper we compute the value function for the "1
blocks vs 3" case.

The game can be adapted to a deck of two suits of ordinary French
cards, with the suit of hearts with values from 1 to 13 and the suite
of diamonds with values from 14 to 26 (but the number of cards can be
higher or lower) For a balanced play the best thing is to make a
second game with the player B has the cards that A had at the
beginning of the first game and vice versa (the B player begins the
second game while A began  the first game).

I'm curious of to know if someone have ever played this game and their
impression. It would be interesting also a software implementation
with AI for the computer ability in this game.

Bye,
