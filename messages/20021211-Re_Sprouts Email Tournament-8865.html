In all the abstract games which I enjoy, you can play so as to try to
improve your position.

In sprouts, either you are able to analyse the position fully (when
either you know that you have a won position, or you know that your
opponent has a won position but you can hope that he goes wrong), or you
can't and the move that you make might as well be random.

Can you persuade me otherwise?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's a great summary of the old view of sprouts.  I remember many
years ago at a chess tournament the math professor David Sumner
expressed exactly the same idea.  Lately, though, the concept of
"survivors" has given the game a strong strategical element.  A
survivor is a live spot in an exhausted position.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't see how this provides any strategical element at all.  I stand 
by my statement - either I can calculate the full value of the position 
(and it is then trivial knowing what move to make), or I can't, and I 
have no reason to prefer any move over any other.  I would say this of 
any impartial game.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think you really have two ideas, one of which is very valid.  It is
true, or seems to be from my experience, that advantages do not
accumulate in sprouts the way they do in chess or go.  If that feature
is necessary for your interest, sprouts is probably not for you.  On
the other hand, I also know from my own experience that there are
strategical ideas that can give us guidance and orientation in the
absence of a total calculation.  The survivor concept is the best
example of such a strategical idea.  A given position might have just
enough liberties to make 3 or 4 survivors the likely outcome.  One
player will need 3, the other 4.  The first player will try to "dry
up" the position while the second player will play for fecundity.  The
players can meaningfully make these attempts even if they cannot do
the complete calculation.  For instance, enclosing moves tend to be
more fecund.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
A live spot is either a "cannibal" or a "ghost".  A cannibal is a live
spot with 0 or two lines attached.  A ghost is a live spot with one
line attached.
Any sprouts move must change a position with an even number of
cannibals to a position with an odd number of cannibals, and vice
versa.  Since a survivor is a cannibal, the player to move in any
position can count the number of cannibals and instantly know whether
he needs an even or an odd number of survivors in the final position.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Using nim notation, a cannibal is equal to 0, a ghost is equal to *. The 
number of cannibals in a position is irrelevant, as each cannibal 
provides either no move, or a move for each player.  If you are going to 
move to a position with nothing but cannibals and ghosts, and you can 
arrange for the number of ghosts to be even, you win by doing so;  and 
if you make it odd, you lose by doing so.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't follow you at all here.  I wish I had not brought up
cannibals.  Cannibals are just a shortcut for determining the survivor
parity needed to "win" any position or subposition.

Play revolves around trying to get an even or an odd number of
survivors.  As the position gets more and more divided up, players try
to extract desirable numbers of survivors from different sections of
the position.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

But they don't know which of odd and even is desirable, unless they can 
evaluate the whole game.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The players can evaluate the whole game - strategically.  They can
gauge the various subpositions in terms of likely numbers of survivors
and then form plans.  All of this in the absence of exhaustive
calculation.

Often there will be a position or subposition in which
one player will try to maximize the number of survivors and the other
player will try to minimize the number of survivors.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The number of survivors is irrelevant.  It is the number of ghosts (*s) 
that matters, and it is only the parity of this number that is of 
interest, not its size.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't know what you mean here at all.  I think you are wildly
confused, but I would be very interested if you are expressing
something meaningful.  I should never have used the word "ghost".  A
ghost is simply a noncannibal, a spot to disregard in determining the
survivor parity needed.  The way I should have said it is, "Every game
has 3n - s moves, so the parity of s determines the winner."
 
</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Sometimes there
will be cases in which a player succeeds too well, minimizes or
maximizes too much.  There is a lot of room for experience and
intuition in estimating and trying to influence how many survivors a
position or subposition will yield.

A surprisingly useful notion is the concept of a "universal trap" or
UT.  A UT is a subposition consisting of two communicating spots, each
with 0 lines attached, and such that either (1) neither spot
communicates with any other spot or (2) both spots communicate with
one other spot, a spot with two lines attached and which itself
communicates with at least one more spot.  We generally try not to
move to a UT because the second person to move to a UT can determine
whether the UT will yield an even or an odd number of survivors.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Do you mean "we generally try not to move <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>in<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> a UT"?  This would make 
sense, as the only move in a UT is to *2.


UT (1) has the value {*2|*2}, which is equal to 0.  This means that, 
with competent play, it might as well not exist.  But if you can't 
evaluate the position and you think that your opponent may be able to, 
it is a good idea to avoid moving in a UT (1), as it increases your 
opponent's options.  (It also increases your own options, but this is no 
use to you while you can't evaluate the position.)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

There are two types of UTs, as I elliptically indicated.  You're
missing the fact that a move into the second type of UT can be
advantageous by affecting the UT itself and the configuration beyond
the UT.  But, I think you're getting the main idea.  The strategical
creation of a UT is often an attempt to simplify advantageously.  But
the creation of UTs also seems to be an efficient way to produce more
survivors.

Again, you can always evaluate the entire position, imperfectly but
usefully, by applying strategic ideas.

These ideas and some related ideas explained on the website
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.geocities.com/chessdp">www.geocities.com/chessdp</a> help make the game a lot of fun to play from
the first move on.  Various rules of thumb give the player a good
strategical orientation immediately, and he is able to make
meaningful, goal-oriented moves.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Would you say the same about nim?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I would say nim suffers from too much strategy.  There is a grand
strategy, the Sprague-Grundy technique, that allows us to evaluate any
position,easily and infallibly, without forming a tree of analysis at
all.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
In the kind of position which you describe in which a player knows he
is lost, it's the same as in chess.  If the player knows his opponent
has the technique and knowledge to certainly win, he resigns.
Otherwise he tries to make problems for his opponent, using strategy
and tactics.  But most of sprouts play occurs in difficult, unclear
positions.  One player or the other invariably resigns long before the
position is exhausted.  Beginners are often amazed how early
resignation comes.  In fact, resignation usually comes long before
meaningful, nonrandom play would have even begun in the old days
before the survivor concept.

I hope this diatribe has been a reasonable answer to your question!
