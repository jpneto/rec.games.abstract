 Quite a while ago, I recall haveing read something about a program that
simulates a computer. In that virtual computer's memory are two programs,
made in some sort of assembly. These two programs are executed simultanously.
 The object of the game is to write a program that, after both programs have
terminated, occupied the most memory, or has even wiped the other program
out of memory, or has modified the other program etc.

I believe what you're looking for is called "core wars."  It is an ongoing
competition and there is an entire newsgroup on the subject.  I don't recall
the exact name, but try "rec.games.core-wars" or similar titles.
