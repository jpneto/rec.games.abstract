Does the complexity of solving a jigsaw puzzle increase on the order of the
square of the number of pieces in the puzzle?  Obviously if we compared each
piece with all the other pieces, this would be so.  But there are much better
ways to puzzle.  Does anyone know what would happen if we piece by piece
compared our pieces with the edges of existing blocks on our tableau?  After a
while, lots of pieces have been successfully fitted together and we don't have
to compare with as many open edges.  But the time series of the model might
still go up as O(n^2).  Is there any way to do say an FFT on something like
this?  Or is there some sort of parallel method of solution which would be
faster?
