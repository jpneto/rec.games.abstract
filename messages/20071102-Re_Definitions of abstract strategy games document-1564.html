The taxonomy has other purposes.  For one thing, it is a way to
systematize things so that you get to see if there are any concepts in
abstracts not developed yet.  Secondarily, the discussion for this
document came out when trying to discuss exactly what games would be
under the banner of IAGO verses what wouldn't.  If not look at, even
with areas that aren't important, you then end up with a case where a
slippery slope develops, and IAGO ends up being a general table game
association, that now includes Scrabble, Third Reich, Settles and
Carcassone, because "gee, they all have some level of abstraction".
There has to be a line drawn somewhere, and better to start off as
detailed as possible and then simplifying then trying to go the other
way.

Though in the second case, how pieces are stored off the board is not in
any way, shape or form a defining point of an abstract game.  Loads of
highly themed wargames have replacement and reinforcement tracks, for
example.  For that matter, nor do any other of your "key elements"
actually define an abstract game apart from one that isn't.

As for a Checkmate Champion and the other categories, a Checkmate
Champion (Royal Elimination) is next to Multipiece Elimination
(Checker games), so this detail prevents you from deciding, "Hey we
have two games that involve eliminating pieces, chess and checkers.
Let's have them lumped together in the same category".  Well, Chess
and Checkers, by the nature of one game focusing on Royal piece(s)
being eliminated, while the other one isn't, are different game types
by nature.  While the voids aren't relevant to that part, the
categorization of game types in general are.

My point here remains I wonder where the NULL attribute (or any other
"key elements") is in any way going to categorise the game.  If it
doesn't then do you want it there?

There is minutia in there for academic reasons, and also for game

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My thought is it starts off with what is basically academic minutiae in
the Key Elements, because none of them really outline <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>why<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> something is
abstract.  It's a bit like saying a key element of being a human is
having a heart.  Well, it is, but that's not a way anyone defines a
human, and I think there's a reason for that.

 The idea of Queues in some aspect are used to handle
games that are stacking and Mancala games. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

But Mancala queues are on the play area, and not in the NULL , and
that's typically the case in stacking games too, so if you want to build
in queues I think you need to do it in a different place.  I still can't
really see that the NULL attribute is a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>primary characteristic<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of an
abstract game.  (Though GIPF may provide an exception (but is it the
sort of exception that GIPF stands on its own because of it?  I'd have
said a "no legal moves remaining" end condition was a better way of
categorising it than specifically the bit that isn't the board can't
provide a new piece)).

This document now is the "academic" version used to look at what is or
is not abstracts and for philosophical discussion.  The practical
version, which will fit under the standards rules for IAGO, will be a
different version completely and embedded in rules.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

My discussion point (philosophical or not) remains that how the
off-board area is handled is immaterial to a game being abstract or not.
 There is nothing about an abstract that requires certain
characteristics to be in place off the board, and there's nothing in a
themed game that prevents the use of identical mechanisms.

And before you worry too much that I'm hung up on NULL...

"[Key elements]
There are multiple key elements that define all abstract strategy
games. These elements are: &lt;snip&gt;"

is hampered by the fact that you could equally say:

"[Key elements]
There are multiple key elements that define all strategy board
games. These elements are: &lt;snip&gt;"

You could probably take out the "strategy" as well and it would still be
true.  So the start point and (presumably) most fundamental part of the
document doesn't actually help you with the stated purpose of defining
an abstract strategy game in a usefully exclusive way.

I would think if you want to do an academically thorough job on it you
should start with saying these are the key elements of a board game, and
further develop them to formally differentiate how the board, pieces
etc. of an ASG are differentiated from a non-ASG.  That way your
definition has the advantage of actually defining something, and if you
want to boot 3rd Reich out then you'll need something that does that.

Down near the end you suggest something along the lines with the "(pure
abstract)" at the end of the 100% deterministic, but that's a bit of a
sub clause and looks like an afterthought rather than a primary document
point.

I hope I'm not coming across as someone trying to drag your efforts
down.  I think you're to be applauded for giving it a go and I am hoping
it's constructive criticism.

Pete.
