What is Mornington Crescent?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Players take turns naming London subway stops.  The first person to name
Mornington Crescent wins.  Of course, you can't say it too soon or it's no
fun to play with you . . .

i thought that was a joke reply, but then....

This is an extremely simpli[f]ied version of the game, though...
moves are determined by a very strong aesthetic sense of what
is a "good move"; while these aren't rules, just conventions,
they are universally understood and a good player must work within
them to gain any respect.  See the group alt.games.mornington.cresent
(yes, spelled wrong) for some excellent playing.

there isnt enough traffic there to get a clue.  i have seen 1 post in
the last week or so and it wasnt about the game.

so its a very subjective interraction of people saying things to each
other and having the group as a whole decide the merit of the move?
then you say the conventions are "universally understood" - just what
do you mean?  perhaps its a sophomoric exercise to get the "insiders"
group to feel smug about themselves and chuckle at the "outsiders"?

there are legit possibilities with this sort of thing, but who knows?
