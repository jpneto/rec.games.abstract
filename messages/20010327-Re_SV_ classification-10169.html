Hello Carl Johan,

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Ok, I think I have understood your goal now.

Some questions:

When and how will your abstract games project be available?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I will will soon begin proofreading, writing the introduction (!) and add
a few more diagrams (including problems and their solutions). I hope the
book will be published at the end of the year, but this is just a hope.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What is your motivation for describing games in terms of the final goal,
don't you find the players' perspective of what do to more interesting?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I have a Master degree in Cultural Anthropology and in Religious Studies.
So I definately find the motivation of players very interesting. My
classification system resulted directly from my book project: i needed an
easy way to structure the book. As i include many new games as well, it
would have been difficult to use a historic classification system. For
that reason I decided to develop a new system strictly based on the
goal(s) of a game. I didn't have the time (actually i'm supposed to write
my dissertation now!) to conduct an empirical study, but perhaps i will
research the motivation of players in my habilitation.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I certainly think the means of achieving the goal and the strategy are
more interesting than the final goal.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I think the first is true for social scientists who "just" research
"gaming", the second is true for learning to play a game "really" good.
However, my classification system is based on logic, is easy to
understand, and does its purpose well. BTW, if you could see my system in
its full beauty, you wouldn't find it "artificial". Gipf is quite an
unusual case, but you find 95% of all games exactly there, where you expect
them.


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
I also think that a book that would
interest new players in the games is more interseting than a pure
classification.]
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">


The classification is just a means to structure the book and described in
the introduction. The main part of the book consists of game descriptions
(history and the complete rules, often followed by an example game and/or
a problem. Also I give contact addresses. The book is written in German,
but you will find, for instance, the contact addresses of American Pool
Checkers clubs, the British Go Federation or the Swedish Renju
Federation -- actually i just realize my childhood dream, this is the
book i always wanted to buy, but couldn't find anywhere).


</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
What games do you find most interseting after classifying 120 games?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well, i didn't need to create a classification to answer your question. My
answer is rather subjective and personal, so nobody should be hurted, if
his or her game is not my favorite game. We all have our favorite games,
which is perfectly o.k. (i'm not a missionary and don't believe in games).

I love Go, but find the Ing rules more "logical". I love Draught variants
(and invented one 13 years ago which i describe in my book), but usually
prefer Draughts variants with fast-moving "kings". I find Frisian Draughts
fascinating. I like Mancala variants and play Oware a lot. I like Salta.
The Chess and Mancalah variants have probably the most interesting
history, but i don't play chess variants often. I played Chu Shogi 16
years ago the first time, when i still was a kid and learned Go in Belgium
(i was living in Belgium) when there was not yet a Go club in the whole
country. But that's a different story.

I think, a good idea is to play one game really good (even in clubs and at
tournaments),  and yet remain open to play some other games and appreciate
their beauty. We should never become single-minded, but it's not good
to play 120 wonderful games without ever understanding at least the
hidden beauty of at least one of them. Just my opinion.
