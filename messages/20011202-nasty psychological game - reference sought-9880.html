Who has any information on this game, or can point me to literature or a
website?

11 straight lines are drawn between player 1 and player two.
Both players place a bet in a box placed at the 6th (middle) line.
Both players get a score of 50 points.
At every move, they both write down how many points they want to "invest" in
the next move.
Then they show their papers to each other. The box will move one line
towards player 1 if he has the highest bid, to player 2 when he has, or
stays on the line where it is when player 1 and 2 invest the same.
Points are substracted from the 50 points both players initially have.

As an example: after move 1 player 1 has invested 5 points, player 2 has
invested 3.
The box is moved one line towards player 1. Now player one has 45 points to
player two 47.

When you can move the box to your home line, you win all the money.
Otherwise, at the end of the game (both players have invested all their
points) the money goes to the player nearest to the box.

I've played this game a few times during my student years. It was quite a
nasty game, because psychology seemed to have an enormous role. Sometimes I
played guys with 40 or even 30 points against their 50, and still managed to
win.

Does anybody know this game ?
