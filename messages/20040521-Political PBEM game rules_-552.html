Hi,

I'd like to moderate a political game with 4-7 players.  I could draw
up one myself but I guessed someone out there had probably already
done it.  I was hoping someone here might know of where I could
download the rules for a relitively simple political game that didn't
require a board or pieces.  A friend told me about a turn based email
political game he played that had a fantasy setting with different
races.  That sounded really cool to me.  Know of anything like it?  If
need be I'll head to my local gaming store to pick up what I need, if
need be, but don't want to try and start something that requires any
of the players to buy stuff to play.  Any suggestions?  Advice?

TIA, Tross
