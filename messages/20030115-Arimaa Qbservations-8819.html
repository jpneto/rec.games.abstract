I can't help myself, but Arimaa feels a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>lot<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> like Go. Of course I
have yet to actually finish a game, but the move system makes it into
a game of small increments. I find myself able to radically prune my
lookahead because of this fact, as well. Given a particular situation
in an area, it is fairy easy to determine the subset of pieces that
can influence the position over the next turn or two because you know
that there are no pieces with global influence. The fact that you can
split your move among several pieces means that direct attacks are
fairly easy to foil, you have to play for a strategic position that
narrows your opponents options.

Anyway, this is just my disorganized $0.02 worth on the game. I like
it a lot, actually. Coule someone mutate an ICS server (perhaps) to
support it? I fear that my experience of the game is skewed because of
the limited number of opponents I have.
