<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Is it just me, or does it seem that abstract, perfect-information,
<br>deterministic (no randomity) strategy games are generally considered
<br>the classiest of all games?
<br></blockquote>
<br>In some environments I am disappointed to see how much they are 
sidelined, even derided.&nbsp; Some of this could be inverse snobbery, of 
course.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Contrast that with backgammon, another age-old classic.&nbsp; Popular
<br>opinion seems to hold that it's a lesser game--probably because of the
<br>dice.&nbsp; Even bridge, though highly regarded, somehow lacks the class
<br>that chess and go enjoy.
<br></blockquote>
<br>My perception of backgammon is that it is regarded as a classy game in 
some circles.&nbsp; My perception is more to do with who has played these 
games, though.&nbsp; Chess and go have grandmasters, and chess has noted 
royal players.&nbsp; Backgammon was popular among 18th century clergy, and in 
the 19th century it was played often by Gladstone.&nbsp; I don't see the same 
associations with Settlers of Catan, Acquire, or Lines of Action.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Maybe I'm the only one who sees this phenomenon.&nbsp; Am I just imagining 
things, or do some kinds of games have a classier reputation than 
others?
<br></blockquote>
<br>It's very subjective, though, isn't it.&nbsp; I don't see things like Gipf, 
Hex and Dvonn in the same light.&nbsp; My criteria are different to yours, 
though in recognising a game as "classy" I don't necessarily recognise 
it as good.&nbsp; In recognising the game as good, I don't necessarily want 
to play it, but that's another matter altogether.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>And while we're at it, which game do you think is the classiest--and
<br>why?
<br></blockquote>
<br>Chess has to be the classiest game for me, though it's the one I least 
want to play.&nbsp; It generated so much literature, attracted so many 
grandmasters, and players such as Caliph al-Mamun and Queen Elizabeth I, 
that I can't help but recognise that it must have good reason for such 
universal respect.
<br>
<br>But all this is subjective and arbitrary: ask again tomorrow and you 
might get a different answer from me.
