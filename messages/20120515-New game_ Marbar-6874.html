My usual MO is to sit on a game until I decide it isn't worth playing, but Corey Clark egged me on a bit to make this one. Marbar is a Bangla word that means, "Of Killing."

With pictures:

The gist is that there is one neutral piece that makes deterministic moves, destroying the board as it progresses. Each player controls a single piece, with which they try to capture the neutral piece without letting the neutral piece capture them. Draws are possible if neither player is able to kill the neutral piece, in which case everybody loses.

I found that making the rules for the monster's movement both unambiguous and intuitive was quite tricky, and I'm not sure I quite have it yet.

Happy hunting,
