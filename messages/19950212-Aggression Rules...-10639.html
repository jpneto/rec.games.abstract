On aggression.  If I remember correctly, you draw up a map.  Then
each player is given 100 armies or so.  Each player alternates turns
placing a number of their remaining armies in different areas that are
unoccupied.
   Players then alternat turns moving a certain number of their armies
into enemy territories.  If the attacker's armies exceed the defender's,
meaning the number of armies used to attack, the country is defeated and
the player takes over.  I believe armies are only allowed to move into
one country.  The winner's army remains in the country and loses none.
   In the end, the player controling the most amount of territories wins
the game.  Play around with the rules some.  I am not sure this it it.
   Let me know how it is.
