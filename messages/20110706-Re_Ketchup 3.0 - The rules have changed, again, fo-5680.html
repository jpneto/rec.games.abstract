Christian, can you see how your statement might seem a little vacuous after
you spent the past couple of weeks completely ignoring my arguments to the
contrary?  I'd like to see your response to my r.g.a. post, Symple Logic,
now that you're talking to me again (i.e. now that you've been flushed out
of Omar's burqa).

You're presenting common knowledge as if it were your godgiven

that and I'm not going to explain that again. You <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>intentionally<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> keep
misinterpreting whay I say and there's nothing I can do to prevent

My honest belief about Sygo's "balancing mechanism", after all this
exhaustive red herring barrel dodging, is that it might - <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>might<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> - make a
very unbalanced game somewhat less unbalanced.  Unlike Nick Bentley's game,
Ketchup, in which there is a form of balance, in Sygo I don't see any
balance at all.  I think <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>you<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have a balance issue...

There's nothing 'honest' about you Mark, or you would recognize Sygo
is a great game. Balancing the basic a-symmetry of its first player
advantage by an a-symmetry that runs counter to it, and that is
embedded in (and thus provided by) the mechanism itself, you know what
that is Mark?

That's the back rotor of a helicopter. But you not only doubt the back
rotor, you doubt the whole concept of the helicopter.
Sygo's move protocol and the dilemma it presents are an important
discovery, quite apart from its perfectly working and aestetically
pleasing balancing mechanism. This is Go for a faster age.

But not for Mark Smear or Mark Sneer or whoelse is imprisoned in Mark
Steere. Unhappy personalities, so much is clear.
