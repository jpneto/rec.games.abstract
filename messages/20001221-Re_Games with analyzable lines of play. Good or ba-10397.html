The RULES of bridge are well defined. When bidding which bids are legal
is well defined. When playing which cards are legal is well defined.
What is not covered by the rules are conventions -- both during bidding
and card play.  I tend to equate the conventions to be components of the
strategy and tactics of bridge.  The fact that bidding conventions exist
is acknowledged by the rule requiring the partner of the bidder to
explain the meaning of the bid if the opponents ask.

1) If your partner knows that you make psychic bids, your partner
should alert essentially everything or otherwise make this clear.
2) Your partnership's bidding conventions are supposed to be
symmetric.
Does your partner make psychic bids the same way you do, and do you
thus alert your opponents?

Unless you have a convention on psychic bids (the partner knows when a
particular bid is/will be psychic), a simple general warning that your
partnership uses psychics is enough.

Such a rule would be illegal, except as a convention and the opponents
would never be bound by it.

Bridge assumes a high level of ethics. However, a partnership used to
playing a bad but complicated set of conventions will have an unfair
advantage over those who are not familiar with the proper defenses
against those conventions. Thankfully, there is a lot more to bridge
than exploiting strange conventions, but I would like to see at least
some tournaments have no restrictions or alerts on the bidding
whatsoever beyond constraints on passing extra information.

The ethics here is that having an undisclosed (to the opponents)
convention is considered cheating.  There is no trival way to prove that
a partnership is in fact using an undisclosed convention.

Ahh, your talking about strange extra rules that tournament organizers
add to the game.  -- That is an entirely different problem, you have a
problem with house rules.  The not helpful advice is 'if you don't like
the rules, don't play'.
