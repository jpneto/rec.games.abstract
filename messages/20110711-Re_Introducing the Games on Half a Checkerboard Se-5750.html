Oh Hutnik is retarded.  And sick.  He lives to harm abstract games.

That's exactly what it is, Fizzy.  The same.  Fucking.  Vein.  I don't even
want to get into Hutnik's shit, but just briefly....   Hutnik's definition
of abstract game is even more fucked than the bgg definition ("kinda seemed
like an abstract to whoever checked the Abstract Game box when uploading the
game description").  To Hutnik, Rock 'em Sock 'em robots is an abstract
game.  The games we deal with here in rec.games.abstract (abstract games)
are to Hutnik "pure abstract strategy games".  Beyond that asinine shit,
Hutnik has created a bizarre rating system for how abstract a game really
is.   Poker is at one level, Backgammon another.  But basically everything
is an abstract to some degree.  It's like Scientology.  The more you know,
the stupider it gets.

So it's not surprising when Hutnik shows up here with a series of classic
games, mutilated and uglified by adapting them to a tiny, oblong board. 
Just more of the same shit from Hutnik.
