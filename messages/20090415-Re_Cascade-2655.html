Unusual!  What was the inspiration for this one?

A puzzle I once saw:

Given a line of +s and -s, write a new line under this but staggered
half a position.  The symbols in the new line (which will be one
shorter than that above) will be made by the multiplication rule:

 + x + = +
 + x - = -
 - x + = -
 - x - = +

This is continued until the last line has only one symbol.  Examples:

  - + - - +     + - + - +
   - - + -       - - - -
    + - -         + + +
     - +           + +
      -             +

The puzzle is if there are arbitrarily large such constructed
triangles with an equal number of +s and -s (and provide a proof or
disproof of this).

The assymetry of the multiplication rule makes it unsuitable for a
game, so I wanted a symmetric variant.  Using three colours, this was
possible.  My original game only allowed placing in the top line, but
I found the game more interesting in the general version.  This also
allowed using a normal Checker board.

Another way of making it symmetric is to use three predecessors and
use a majority rule.  This can be done in 3D by placing stones in a
triangular grid and then place new stones on top of three lower
stones, forming a triangular pyramid in the end.  Obviously, placement
is only at the bottom, and counting requires breaking down the pyramid
(or counting unused stones).  I tried this with marbles, but it proved
too mechanically unstable.  You could use coloured disks instead.

However, I like the idea of using a third colour and that it may
sometimes be advantageous to place a stone of the opponent's colour.
You can add a bit of that in the pyramid variant by saying that three
identical stones yield the opposite colour but otherwise use majority.
