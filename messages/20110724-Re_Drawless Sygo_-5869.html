In the early days of arimaa, if both players lost all their rabbits,
the game ended in a draw, as the main winning condition couldn't be
accomplished. Omar was happy with this, as he felt that a well-
designed game should end in a draw with perfect play. Then he realized
that the possibility of a draw didn't mean perfect play would lead to
it. Moreover, allowing draws was bothersome in tournaments. So Omar
introduced the rule that you also won if you captured all the
opponent's rabbits. At first, the rule was only in effect in
tournaments, while casual games could still end in a draw. Finally,
the rule was made universal.

The whole 'fable' is dispersed in several threads of the arimaa forum.

That's not what I meant. In fact, the superko rule (ugly as it is) has
always been applied in arimaa. But it doesn't abruptly interrupt play
when a position repeats itself. Rather, the move which causes the
repetition is illegal, and the player must choose another one. But the
rule rarely comes into effect.

One more thought. I admit that, in games with first or second move
advantage, a small draw rate might not be a great issue. After all,
you're already forced to play an even number of games to ensure
fairness, and ties will appear whether draws are allowed or not. But
in well balanced games, like arimaa or sygo, there's no problem in
playing an odd number of games, so draws are the only possible reason
why the match has to be prolonged. In arimaa, they aren't anymore...

Oh, and sorry for the delay in answering. I won't go into details, but
my Internet connection is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>absolutely<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> miserable.
