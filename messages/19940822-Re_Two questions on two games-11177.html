One of my favorite games was described in Gamut of Games and
was called Lines of Action.  It was played with a checker set 
and board, lining the white pieces along two parallel edges
and the black ones along the other two edges.  The object was
to end up with your remaining pieces connected.  For some reason 
I have not seen it mentioned much, and yet I found it a very
exciting game.  Perhaps it suffered the fate of games which
cannot be marketed given that they can be played with a set
already in the market.  Nobody has an interest in promoting
them.  Then perhaps somebody gave it a different name (as
was done with Reversi) and I don't know about it,

	Glad you asked, Pedro!
	Lines Of Action is actively played in a postal chess and games
club called NOST (stands for kNights Of the Square Table). Of the non-
chess games played in the club, it is easily the most popular. The name
has not changed, but we sometimes call it LOA for short.
	Since it is such an elegant, flexible game, it lends itself to
variants. At club conventions, we sometimes play a four-handed LOA. By
mail, Parachute LOA is currently enjoying some popularity.
	I'm not sure if G. of G. mentions this, but we have a club rule
that states : Whenever a player forms a connected group, and in the pro-
cess of doing so causes his opponent to connect a group, the player who
actively formed the group is declared the winner of that game. 

ObPlug: NOST is a friendly little club and one of the few to play an
astonishing variety of abstract board games by mail. Chess variants, go,
shogi (&amp;variants thereof) are particularly popular, but you can find a
partner for almost any abstract game you want to play by post. For more
info, write to :
		Ronleigh Dale, Nostmaster
		700 South Shafter Ave. 101
		Shafter, CA   93263

	Dues are $17 per year. The club bulletin, NOST-ALGIA, is published
6 times per year.
