Yes, I see that now.

Except that you did confuse the issue by saying

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
More generally, let it be a n_odd-by-n_even rectangle
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

which, since we are talking about a grid, suggests

   n_odd is the number of rows

   n_even is the number of columns

and by the rules of the game, Player 1 chooses a row number, and
player 2 chooses a column number.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
where the player seeking Odd total chooses from {1, ..., n_odd}
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Ignoring the bit above about "seeking Odd total", the rest of the
sentence appears to identify the above player as the one who chooses
the row number, that is, player 1. 

If the "seeking Odd total" is not ignored, then the sentence appears
self-contradictory, since the "seeking Odd total" identifies the
player as Player 2, while the rest of the sentence suggests Player 1.

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
and player seeking Even chooses from {1, ..., n_even}.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Again, it appears from the above that Even is player 2, since a column
is being selected.

Thus, the initial confusion stems from your describing the table as

   n_odd by n_even

suggesting n_odd rows and n_even columns.

So I take back half of my apology!
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Wait a minute.

Leroy's rules specify that Player 1 chooses the column, and Player 2
chooses the row. Since in matrix notation, the entry (i,j) refers to
the entry at row i, column j, with row number first, column number
second, I automatically assumed that Player 1 chooses the row, and
Player 2 chooses the column. Thus, without reading carefully, I
already had the stated rules reversed.

So I give back that half apology (and double it as a penalty for
repeated violations).
