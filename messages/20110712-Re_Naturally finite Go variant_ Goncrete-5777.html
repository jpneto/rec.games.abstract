Back to Goncrete and a little issue I have with it:

Rule 1:
"When one player makes a capture, all the surrounded enemy groups are
flipped (i.e. converted to the player's color). Then, the player must
remove one stone from as many of the groups just flipped as possible
without splitting the newly formed group."

My issue: why <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>must<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> he do so? I'd think a player would have enough of
an incentive to create eyespace if he can, without being forced to do
so.

It's just a matter of consistency. It doesn't sound logical to me to
allow players not to make the removal, when it is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>always<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> beneficial
to make it. It might confuse new players. So I think it's more logical
to establish the 'eye-opener' (nice word) as an automatic mechanism. I
know it's not comparable, but I wouldn't understand it if the rosette
in Medusa only secured life when the player wanted it to, or, more
properly, if players were allowed to pass their turn in Hex or
Havannah.

Lastly, the 'eye-opener' being an automatic procedure, you needn't
perform it manually when playing on a computer. The program will
always know when it must be used and remove one random stone from the
corresponding group(s) whenever necessary.

(Footnote: When I first read the word 'eye-opener', it reminded me the
unpleasant gadget which kept Malcolm McDowell's eyes open in that
scene from Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.)
