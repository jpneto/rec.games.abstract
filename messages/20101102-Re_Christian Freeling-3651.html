Clark, you have one interesting game - Particle Bond.  Canvas hit the
canvas, as we all remember, and Ki is the game you wouldn't shut up
about until you finally admitted privately that it's bullshit.  That's
all you've got.  You're like Gering with the psuedo-eminence.

You were talking to me recently about "passing the torch."  The torch
isn't something that gets passed.  The torch is something you take,
and boy you've got a lot of taking to do.

This is one for the databanks. I have one interesting game as far as
you're concerned, not just one interesting game in total. See there's
a difference, one's bullshit, the other isn't objective but at least
it takes into account the opinion of a bunch of people who actually
describe my games as "interesting". At least 4 people mentioned that
they really like Ki, I just found it to be surprisingly simplistic. I
don't have the slightest regret about that design, it's what great
design is all about, boiling the elements down into a singular idea.
Maybe it's not that fun compared to Go I dunno but it has a quality of
elegance. It's a really beautiful game, I can accept a cold reception
because it's a game that's almost purely design interest and people
like making huge captures, something Ki doesn't offer. I already
mentioned that I don't think Canvas is a bad game either, it just has
no reference point, it doesn't fit into my design agenda and it really
was just some fucking around in the sandbox. And now I have
Radiolarians a game which Vit555 on iggc found so fascinating he
introduced Arty and another user to it without me even realizing it.
Give me 20 years working with the same level of productivity I am now
and we'll see which category I fall under. "Pinch Hitter" Steven
Meyers with such famous offerings as Trellis (Quax with the diagonals
already filled), Anchor (draw susceptible), Orbit (draw susceptible)
and Forms, sure doesn't seem very active these days *Steve? You here
buddy? We need you to make another Draw susceptible Star-like game*.
Give me a break.... I'll be taking that <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>grabs torch<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>
