<br></blockquote>
<br>Well, it certainly wouldn't improve the game.&nbsp; But both
<br>that change and a change to 0.1 would, it seems to me, make far
<br>less difference than you seem to think.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; No difference at all to matches, where only wins matter, inc
<br>especially WC matches, which is where many of the complaints
<br>have come.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; No difference at all to league chess [perhaps 60-70% of all
<br>serious chess in the UK], where only wins affect the match
<br>result.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; No difference at all to "friendly" chess in your club.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; No difference at all to KO tournaments.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; Negligible difference to "weekend" tournaments, where you have
<br>to be very lucky to win a 5-round event with 4/5.&nbsp; Four wins
<br>and a draw will put you ahead of everyone with either one loss
<br>or two draws, whether the draw scores 0.1 or 0.9.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; Negligible difference to 5-min or rapidplay or correspondence
<br>tournaments, where "soft" draws are already very rare.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; So you are left with long Swiss tournaments and round-robins.
<br>These may be an important part of top GM chess, but it's a
<br>tiny proportion of chess as played by the rest of us.
<br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; Even then, while there certainly are abuses [which can be stopped
<br>by other means -- Rentero simply didn't invite players who
<br>took short draws back to Linares], you seem to be assuming
<br>that a large proportion of draws are abusive, and would stop
<br>if draws scored &lt; 0.5.&nbsp; It would plainly have <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>some<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> effect;
<br>but it seems to me like an unnecessary sledgehammer to crack
<br>the wrong and rather small nut.&nbsp; A long tournament simply is
<br>a very arduous event -- it's like taking 11 or 14 6-hr exams
<br>on consecutive days, with any single lapse of concentration
<br>potentially scoring you zero on that paper.&nbsp; If you deny the
<br>players ways of taking some days off, they will simply find
<br>other ways.
<br></blockquote>
<br>I have to say you make some very good points
<br>concerning chess' big picture.
<br>
<br>I would only add, however, that it is precisely the
<br>play of the best players that has the best chance of
<br>gaining an audience. If chess tournaments were
<br>perceived as battles rather than drawfests, they
<br>would be worth paying attention to. We'd be a lot
<br>more interested in what happened in that
<br>Anand-Kramnik game if we could count on it
<br>being a struggle, instead of, as is more likely,
<br>an uneventful draw.
<br>
<br>Also, if playing the drawing game no longer worked
<br>in tournaments,&nbsp; who is to say that some of that
<br>fighting spirit wouldn't carry over to other aspects of
<br>the game? My sense is that much of the fondness for
<br>draws is psychological. I think one of the reasons
<br>humans do so poorly against computers is that humans
<br>are simply unprepared to face a monster that is
<br>relentlessly trying to gain an advantage every single
<br>move.
<br>
<br>A few corrections. Rentero's efforts were
<br>too weak and were unsuccessful. My argument
<br>has nothing to do with labeling certain draws
<br>as "abusive". The numbers of both long and
<br>short draws are increased by 1867-scoring.
<br>Rather than hold a pointless debate over which
<br>draws are "worthy", the idea behind alternate
<br>scoring is to simply reduce the number of all
<br>draws by making them less rewarding.
<br>It's more than silly to have a tournament structure
<br>that rewards those who play in a fashion that
<br>produces lots of draws, and then make a
<br>stink because the draws they are being paid
<br>to play don't look like we want them to.
