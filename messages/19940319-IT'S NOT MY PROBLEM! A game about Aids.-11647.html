IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM! A game about Aids, by Kuon Custer Hunt 1988
Manual available from 
Simulation Technologies, 1612 West Cherry, Lompoc, CA 93436.Simultech.

Hello !

Short describtion of the game:
Last week I get a copy out of SIMULATION &amp; GAMES Sept. 1989 with  a brief
description of the game IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. It's a game for many players
(at least 12) and one banker. The players have to deal with red, blue and other
chips to live and survive. The chips represent food, spritual and emotional sources 
and s.o.. By doing a special action (deal) a player can be infected, handicapped
and perhaps die.
This belongs to the behavior of the other players. But ONLY the banker knows the 
special action. He gives sometimes news, what the special action may be !
The game ends after ca. 2 hours, when all player are dead or at least two players
will be handicapped.
This is only a brief summary of the brief description.

My Questions:
1. Does anybody knows this game, has the rules and would be able to mail it.
2. Or does anybody has the e-mail-address of Kuon Custer Hunt or of Simulation     
   Technologies ?
   The normal post from here (Germany) to Lompoc takes to much time.

Thank You
   Ruediger
