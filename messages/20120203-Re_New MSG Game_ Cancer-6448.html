Since it is an elimination game, "Go variant" might raise
an eyebrow or two. Further doubt may be fuelled by the fact that
there's no counting and that the size or color of the captured groups
don't seem to matter all that much, except in the vacant territory
they leave behind. So what's the strategy, sitting it out till
gridlock? That may be quite a while. Fortunately it's a Mark Steere
game, very much so I would say, so the longer players can enjoy it,
the better. I wonder if it beats Tanbo. ;-)

As usual, Christian, you've rendered an opinion while failing to
understand the rules. There is no passing or "sitting out" in
Cancer. Since Cancer is highly scalable, gamelength is a simply a
function of board size.

The rules are clear enough, as might be expected. With "sitting it
out" I mean the same as with a bad movie.

Being ignorant again Mark? Classic.
The Atlantis mechanism was so named after Martin Medema's game
Atlantis, eight years before Amazons:

And Martin was familiar with and possibly inspired by Eric Solomon's
Alaska that had been published a year before:

You're a funny person Mark. But this Cancer at best is less malignant
than its owner and hardly more interesting.
