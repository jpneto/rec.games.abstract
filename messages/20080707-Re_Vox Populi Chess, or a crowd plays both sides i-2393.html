If the goal is finding the person in the audience with the most skill,
I think you need to take into account how many people are on the side
switched to. If everyone has defected to white except one, and that
one wins, he should win the meta-game as well.

I suggest this as a measure of an audience member's score, added for
each move: The total number of people you managed to tempt over to
your side, divided by the the number of people already on your side.
The switching player also loses one point. This keeps the game zero-
sum, which is a very good idea.

If all players end up on one side, the game is obviously over and you
just calculate the winner among the audience. If the game ends in
checkmate (pretty unlikely, I'd think), consider all members on the
losing team as having switched to the winning.
