Nice idea. This must be what Hazen Abouricha was looking for. :)

I do like Luis' game, Trisq.  It introduces a clever, new mechanism for handling the crosscut issue, if perhaps a tad involved.

Thanks, Mark. I'm glad that you like it, but I'm in pessimistic mode today. :) The pattern I found looks very dangerous, even if it's not drawn as it is yet. In fact, I think the chances of the game being drawless are really now, but:

After my initial charge of draw susceptibility in Trisq, I've reversed my stance and now no longer believe draws are possible.  I hope I'm not proved wrong twice  :)

Since you wrote this after seeing the problematic position I posted, I'm assuming you don't think it can actually lead to a draw. What's your reasoning exactly? I was about to drop Trisq as a flawed game after playing around with that pattern a little more, but now I'm curious.
