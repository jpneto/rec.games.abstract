A simple fitness test is to play games to completion and see which
programs wins most often. To avoid repetition, a number of random
start positions should be tested rather than complete games.
Otherwise, you risk that your population converge to a program that
plays a single line of play perfectly but do miserably on all others.
You should use positions from all stages of the game, from initial
game to endgame.

Additional parameters in the fitness function can be time and memory
usage (smaller == better).

I tested my program with a teacher first. I mean I had a sample program
which plays othello (but not so good :(( ) .
So my population played games with this teacher. So I had clear fitness
function. I could also see
non - relatively (definitely) if my population grows up or not. Of course I
can not reach more than just a teacher can play.
So I want to eliminate outside teacher. I tried to put a best chromosome
(the one who won all games with previous teacher)
as a teacher and repeat testing. Problem is that every teacher is diffrent
(maybe better) so I cannot compare results to see progress.
I try again with position from initial game to endgame as you wrote.

best regards
