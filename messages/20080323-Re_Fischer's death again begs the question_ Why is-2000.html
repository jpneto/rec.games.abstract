Beyond this, besides a system gamed to draw, the amount of play in
chess has resulted in there being far less ways to surprise anyone, so
the end game ends up being predictable, minus a bungle.

Hi Richard, let me make a note here, since I am also a chess teacher. 
What
you say is true at the top levels, but for 99% of players does not seem 
to
be true in my experience or student's experience.

Theoretically some players know very much about main lines, but a 'b' 
class
move puts them outside of their book knowledge, and they have to resolve
what to do over the board. The only surprise to me is if they can do that
without their position collapsing almost instantly :)
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The top levels should be getting media interest, getting on TV, being
something used to recruit new players and being relevant.  This is why
I speak to the top level.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I agree with you!

My preference is people who understand THEORY should be doing better,
not people who have memorized line of play.  My preference for chess
makes it more universal in nature.

Yes, though [laugh] I had memorised the first 3 moves against this player 
who was not 2100 postal but USCF. It's true that I forget the move order but 
remembered a complicating manoevre - so, if he does this, I do this - is 
that what you mean by theory?

The last option is to add new rules to chess, to make the game new.
Of course, this is heresy to hardcore players of the game, who think
the FIDE rules were handed down by God and immutable for eternity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Laugh. Unfortunately you are writing to someone who wants to play exactly
the same game as Capablanca, Lasker, Alekhine, Fischer and Kasparov - so
doesn't want new rules that would change the method of play.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

How about the same game that was played in the 18th century?  Well,
that would mean you wouldn't be using the point system and time
controls.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True - but the play of the game would be the same. The only difference is 
that few people in their right minds would sit down for an indefinite amount 
of time to play chess.

What I don't understand about much of this correspondance about draws is 
if
people who suggest its a problem are just speaking as chess spectators 
about
top players [nothing wrong with that, and I share that point of view] or 
if
they are speaking about all chess players?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well my take here about this is that everything is just fine the way
it is, then why isn't it being covered on TV?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I know the answer to that - being one of the few people who ever made a tv 
program about chess. A live event with 8 GMs in it, and 2 world champions - 
and for 2 hours. I know what was right and what was wrong - and maybe you 
have to do it to know that?

 Everyone things some
American player like Bobby Fischer will "magically" appear on the
scene and captivate people again?  Short of this, I hear
rationalizations about how chess is IMPOSSIBLE to do on TV, because
the masses are too stupid to understand it.  It is a form of
intellectual snobbery to justify stagnation in my book.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

People always have their excuses for doing nothing. What is more boring than 
American football with 1 minute of actual play in every 10? But American 
media makes that work, so they can certainly make blitz chess work!

I think if its just the first, and unfought 'GM-draws', then its not

Unless a scoring system encourages playing for wins, why would people
not play cautious and hope for an opponent mess up?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed. Especially these days when you are paid just to show up. But still, 
is this for top players only, or for all players, in your opinion?

Cordially, Phil
