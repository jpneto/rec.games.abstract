A friend of mine has bought a 'game' from a junk shop.  It has no box
and no instructions.  The shop knows nothing at all about it so it's
possible that it is incomplete.

It consists of:

1 wooden board with a rectangular array of holes drilled in it.  The
array is 11 x 14 so there are 154 holes.

64 coloured wooden pegs.  There are four colours so there are 16 pegs of
each colour.  The pegs fit in the holes.

rec.games.abstract also seems like it would be relevant.

You could do worse than to get four people together and have them all
play a sort of "Tic Tac Toe" on the board, each trying to get 4 in a
row.

If it's too easy, try 5 in a row.  If it's too easy, try 3 in a row.

You can play two-player versions of this at

Unlike tic-tac-toe, you get a point each time you make the scoring pattern
and the game continues.

I can't vouch for how good the automated opponent will play on 3 in a row
and 5 in a row.

I know it's not the same as a four player version.  I believe a four playuer
version of the game would have all the issues that four player abstract
games have.  For example, one player's situation becomes hopeless but she
gets to decide which of the other three players wins.

In any case, the two-player game can easily be played using the applet I
posted a few days ago, so I added configurations for these three games.  My
past experience with N-in-a-row games on a square grid suggests that an
additional goal pattern is needed to balance the difficulty in making the
N-in-a-row.  However, that experience is based on (a) longer than 3-in-a-row
and (b) diagonals not allowed.
