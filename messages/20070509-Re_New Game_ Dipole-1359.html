Thank you for your inquiries about the game of Dipole, Bill.  See
below for individual answers.

I checked out the rules, the game sems interesting, but I have
two points to query.

Firstly, the business of keeping checkers in reserve is
very unclear.

Tall stacks wobble, and they do fall down.  Instead of starting with a
12-stack on-board (or a 20-stack in the larger set), you can keep six
of those 12 checkers off-board, just for convenience.  Those six
checkers are still considered to be part of the 12 stack.  As the on-
board six-stack diminishes in size, use the reserve checkers to
maintain it at maximum height, while not exceeding six, until all the
reserve checkers are used up.

I'd keep the reserve checkers in a stack, right behind the on-board
stack, so your opponent can see how many checkers total you
effectively have in your on-board stack.

I changed the rule sheet slightly to hopefully make this point a
little more clear.  There's only so much room on the page though.

Secondly, how is it true that there is always a move available
to one side or the other?  If both players move some or all
their stones up to the far end, and there are no captures
available, they can both make no more moves.  What then?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

On this point, and in my own defense, I'll reprint a couple of quotes
from the rule sheet:

1. "If your move takes your stack out of bounds, then you must remove
that stack from the board."
2. "If you have any moves available, you must move."

Remove those far end stacks from the board, preferably at a rate of
one checker per turn.
