Though I know about your perception, the game is associated with the draw, I
don't believe that is necessarily the case; the draw is only possible if both
players are equal. I believe tic-tac-toe can have its winners and losers like
in any other battle game. Play any 5 year old : )

I'm still confused by what you mean.  My question had nothing to do with the
outcome being a draw.  I usually think of a "fighting game" as requiring
attacks and defeats among pieces.  I see that in chess;  I don't see it in
tac-tac-toe.

Are you saying that any game that has a winner and a loser is a fighting
game?

I think this thread belongs on a role-playing game newsgroup.  This newsgroup

That's probably true.

But at least this poster has shown some thought.  It's not quite the same as
the "hey, I've found this cool game, <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.bloodywizardbattle.com">www.bloodywizardbattle.com</a>" type of
post.
