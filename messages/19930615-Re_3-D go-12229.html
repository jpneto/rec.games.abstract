Here's the first big problem: a single stone can have up to six
liberties, compared with four. Two connected stones have ten liberties,
instead of six. So every time you add a stone to a line and your
opponent forms his own wall alongside, you get three extra liberties,
instead of the one you get in two-dimensional go. Imagine how easy it
would be to dodge in go if you could run away straight up or straight
down. This makes encircling groups, and hence territory, very much
harder. Hard enough it probably isn't interesting. In a way it's a

A similar problem arises when "hexagonal" go is played in 2d.
Longer jumps are uncuttable (and a one-point jump becomes the 
equivalent of a "bamboo connection"), there are no ladders, etc.
In the few hex-go games I've played, there seemed to be fewer
tactical possibilities, because connecting was so much easier
than cutting.

I sat down a couple of years ago, and figured out the smallest
living groups in cubic 3-d go (with two eyes -- I lost interest
before looking for seki positions :) ).  In the center of the
board, 16 stones are required; on a face, 13; on an edge, 11;
and in a corner, 9.

In the center:

  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ...... 
  ......  ......  ...OO.  .OO...  ......  ...... 
  ......  ..OO..  ..O.O.  .O.O..  ..OO..  ...... 
  ......  ......  ...OO.  .OO...  ......  ...... 
  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ...... 

In the corner:  (+ is an edge)

  .....+  .....+  ++++++ 
  .....+  .....+  ++++++ 
  .....+  .....O  +++++O 
  .....+  .....O  ++++O+ 
  ++++++  +++OOO  +++O+O 

And so on.

I suspect that the only practical way for humans to play 3-d go
would be with a good total-immersion VR game space that the players
could move through to examine positions and place their stones...
