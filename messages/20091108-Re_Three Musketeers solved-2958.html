Nothing curious about it.  I candidly admit I'm not very good at
playing games.  My inspirations for getting into design were Go and
Reversi, though I never played them until years after I started
designing.  Cephalopod and Atoll are two of my most popular games but
they're way outside my grokosphere so I seldom play them.

I really don't give a shit.  Everything in this field progresses on a
geological time scale.  I've been designing for 17 years and my games
have only started to become popular in the last five.  I don't have
the words to express how little impact Johannes Laire's involvement or
lack of involvement will have on the slow but steady growth of my
games.

You might have enough to worry about with your own mental health.
Here you're abandoning a game program because you don't like the game
designer.  What a little baby!
