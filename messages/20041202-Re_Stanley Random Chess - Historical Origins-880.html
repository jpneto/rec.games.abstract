THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF STANLEY RANDOM CHESS  by GM Gregory Topov



The origins of Stanley Random Chess have been the subject of debate by
scholars for century. In this article from SR Chess Monthly, GM Topov
provides some personal
insights on this controversial subject.


Contrary to popular belief, the origins of Stanley Random Chess (SR Chess)
are in fact evolutionary in nature. Although I am a fierce opponent of

to

the absurd notion that the origins of man lie in apes, the same cannot be
said for Stanley Random Chess. Historical records now confirm that the
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
name
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
of this classic game originates with primates. Irrefutable evidence
supporting this hypothesis has emerged as a result of the ground-breaking
research of Dr. Bill Goldman and Dr. Simon Morgenstern, recently published
in "Uncovering and Exposing the Stanley in Stanley Random Chess"
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
(University
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Press, 2001).

Until recently, it was incorrectly supposed that Stanley Random Chess owed

the history of SR Chess began with a modern software primate.

Goldman and Morgenstern provide solid evidence that the name "Stanley"
originates with Sir Thomas Stanley (d. 1459), a descendant of William the
Conqueror who excelled in SR Chess from an early age. Recently discovered
ship logs confirm that William the Conqueror's pet monkey, named Stanley,
accompanied him on the ship that arrived at Pevensy Bay on August 28,
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Invasion and William's subsequent coronation, King William's beloved pet

the death of Stanley, William assigned the name as an honorary title to
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
one
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
of the local families that had proved his strongest ally, from which time
they became known as the Stanley family.

The first mention of the game itself is found in historical accounts of
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
the
</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Ferrers family in 1137. The Stanley family apparently learned the game of

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

acquired the unfortunate designation "Stanley Random Chess" or SR Chess.
Originally intended as an insult, the name has stuck, although it is a

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Stanley Random Chess today owes much of its popularity to GM Topov. Under
his influence it has an active presence on the internet, notably the
