<div class="moz-text-flowed">Hello to all!
<br>
<br>I'd like to share the rules of a new game that I've invented recently.
<br>I tested it quite a bit, with a lot of possible variants, and this is
<br>what I came up with.
<br>
<br>You can download the pdf in English and Italian from my blog, my last
<br>post being about Sicic: nomignolov.blogspot.com
<br>
<br>-= Sicic =-
<br>
<br>Sicic is a game for two. Each player guides a group of Astronomers,
<br>aiming at copying the opponents Constellation. Sicic is played on two
<br>8x8 squared boards, named the Earth and the Sky. Each player has 4
<br>pieces that move on the Earth (the Astronomers) and 4 pieces to be
<br>placed in the Sky (the Stars). The Stars are the players Constellation.
<br>There are three phases: the Afternoon, the Evening and the Night. One of
<br>the player will be the first to move in every phase of the game.
<br>
<br>the game
<br>
<br>In the Afternoon, players alternate placing one Astronomer at a time on
<br>the Earth, on an empty square. In the Evening, players alternate placing
<br>one Star at a time in the Sky, on an empty square. In the Night, each
<br>player must move one of his Astronomer every turn.
<br>The Astronomer can move in a direct line in every direction, any number
<br>of unoccupied squares. He must land in an unoccupied square.
<br>The Astronomer may choose not to move, in order to "pinch" one of the
<br>opponents Astronomers set in a neighbouring square. The result of a
<br>pinch is that the pinched Astronomer must move in the next turn.
<br>Moreover, it is forbidden to the opponent, in the second next turn, to
<br>pinch an Astronomer that occupies the abandoned square.
<br>
<br>winning
<br>
<br>The winner is the first player who manages to place his Astronomers in
<br>the same way as the opponents Stars. Translations, reflections and
<br>rotations are allowed. Also, a player can win by pinching an Astronomer
<br>that is not able to move.
<br>
<br>Bye, Jean
