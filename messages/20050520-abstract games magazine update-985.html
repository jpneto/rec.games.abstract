The following is posted on their website:

"A Special Note about Abstract Games Magazine
As you know, we had suspended publication for awhile. It was not something
we wanted to do; it was something we had to do. It turned out to be for a
longer period than we had ever intended. Unfortunately, despite our
optimism, we're still not yet ready to roll the presses. But when we do,
subscribers will begin receiving their issues regularly again. We are
grateful to all our loyal fans and readers for their patience and
understanding.

As its creators, we have taken an atypical departure with this imposed
sabbatical. However, we believe our magazine is worth the wait. It is a
labor of love, and a passion we want to carry on with -- we just cannot say
precisely when that will be.

In the meantime, Happy Gaming! For those of you new to our website and for
those who want to add or rebuild their collections, back issues are still
available and we encourage you to indulge. "

I've just seen the notice now and thought it worth putting up here for any
other subscribers.

Cheers

Mike Wellman
