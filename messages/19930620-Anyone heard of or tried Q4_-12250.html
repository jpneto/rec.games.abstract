I saw "Q4" in the store yesterday.  It seems to be made (or distributed) by
the folks who gave us Abalone, so I'm curious about it.  Unfortunately, the
box (Octagon-shape) gave little clues as to the game.  This is all that I
was able to glean:

	- Can be played by 2,3 or 4 players (or teams)
	- Requires a lot of marbles (the box was pretty heavy)
	- The picture on the box (not of the game) implied that there were
          several (at least 4) different colors of marbles.
	- Their Cute Quote(tm) was:
		"You must outwit your opponent(s) on a four-dimensional
		 board that doesn't even exist!"
	  which explains why there wasn't a picture of the game on the box.
 	- The box implied that there were several levels to the game.  I don't
 	  if that means physical levels or "skill" levels.
	- It cost $35.00 at a relatively high-priced store.

So, has anybody played this yet?  Care to fill in the gaping holes that I've
blundered around?

Thanks,

Dan @ UNC
