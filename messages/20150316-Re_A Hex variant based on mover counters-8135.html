I have problem with my mouse and I have to change it.
I will not then use diagram to explain you how the move by swapping works.
In the first step every player has to place in each hex cell 6 stones per turn.
At the end of the first step 20 hex cells out of 121 (hex board 11*11) will be occupied. So no one will be able to connect the sides.

In the second step players have to move on their turn the stones (one by one).
How to move the stones?
Naturally each player controls cells where he has the majority of stones. If the number of red stones and blue stones are equal then the cell become "neutral".
Player can start his swapping move only if the cell is a friendly one.
As an exemple let us say that the red player want to move one stone from the cell A to D going through the cells B and C.
A--&gt; 6 red 
B--&gt; 6 blue 
C--&gt; 6 blue 
D--&gt; empty cell

He has to take one stone from A cell and swap it with one blue in B then do the same move by swapping a stone of cell C with his red stone to reach finally the cell D.
The path A-B-c-D could be of any configuration as long as they are adjacent consecutively.
Swapping move is required only if the player has no direct access to the cell he wants to target. Otherwise if a cell is either empty or friendly one no need for swapping. 
Why swapping? when you leave a cell you change PROGRESSIVELY the ownership in favor of your opponent. So it will introduce in the gameplay some sort of smart calculation. So the players have to be careful not to loose the ownership if needed. They could willingly loose it if they do not need.

The second step of the game in fact will be : how to dispatch your stones on the board such as you will win the connection.
It if not ALLOWED to take a stone from one cell and put it anywhere in the board.
This will be give the gameplay a more strategic dimension.
