Example 1:  Pie rule in hex

The same picture in havannah, though numbers change with boardsize.

The numbers do indicate pie rule helps

2.  Draws are not possible, and offensive and defensive play is
synonymous (building an inevitable win prevents the opponent from
doing the same.

Different on both counts: draws are possible though <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>extremely<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> rare,
and a player can have a 'framed win' and lose on a prolongued series

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Draws being extreamly rare i would lean closer to no draws rather than
draws (i did the same in my unposted shogi analysis), so that also
supports pie rule (as no opening move will be labled as "drawish").
The lack of mutual attack and defense, however,  is a cautionary tale
to see if pie rule moves lead to overly defensive positions or overly
offensive positions

3.  Without pie rule, one move (center) is clearly the best, and no
other move is worth considering.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

That's different too, but it's game-specific. The center in havannah
is playable from both sides, and I use to offer it for swaps more
often than not.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
There are many possible moves both before and after pie rule, so i
consider this to be neutral.

4.  There is no such thing as a bad move, and even the worst moves
usually can be made useful as a ladder excape.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

True in havannah, but you don't need "a move that's worse than no
move" for a pie, but a move that makes you wonder if it's not worse
than your best answer.

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Well because there is no such thing as a bad move, if you waste your
first move dodging pie, the worst off you could be is the same black
would be otherwise.  That's heavily in favour of pie rule as your 1st
move  does not dictate your 2nd quite so strongly.

5.  The game offers one balancing alternative that naturally sprouts
from the rules:  different side lengths.  However, this is not
balanced (red's disadvantage is in the general area as his natural
advantage).
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

The lack of alternatives also favours pie rule.

As far as i see, that is heavily in favour of pie rule, so i'm not
sure where you thought the analysis failed.


"Uh-oh, the man starts with a condescending disclaimer and signs off
as
Holy Roman Emperor.  I therefore ignore everything in between. "

My disclaimer combined with my title apparently did it's job.  Someone
who did not want to read what i had to say was given a reasonable
excuse not to without being made to feel narrowminded.
