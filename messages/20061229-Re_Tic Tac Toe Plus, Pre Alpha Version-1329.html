Let me know when you're done messing around with regurgitated
Tic-Tac-Toe.  I'll be recusing myself from the loop until then.

Just to tell you that each and everyone of your advice is taken into
consideration, so it's not in vain, OK!

Turning Tic Tac Toe into Tic Tac Toe Plus may not sound spectacular,
however I'm trying to find ways in making the game enjoyable in a
sense. Its hard, but it's a way to keep myself occupied. However, the
hard part is what to do next after I'm finished with this.

The truth is, I like being both a Game Designer and a Game Programmer,
so I think I'll continue wearing both hats on, more like a split
personality, until I'm done with this type of recreation. Being both at
the same time is difficult and needs a lot of patience and time, but
it's also fun and enjoyable.

I'll take a look at your game and see what I can do after reading and
understanding the rules.

Mitoshima.
