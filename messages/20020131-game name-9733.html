I'm trying to find out whether the following game (or something similar) has
a name.

The rules are:
- played by two players
- each starts with some coins (e.g. 10 each)
- on a go, each player holds in his hand some of his coins; the player with
more coins wins the go; both players lose the coins they held out
- the game ends when a player gets ahead by (for example) two wins (in which
case that player wins) or when both run out of coins (a draw)

So for example a game might run as follows:
- A has 10 coins, B has 10 coins; A holds out 3, B holds out 1; so A scores
a win
- A now has 7 coins, B has 9 coins; A holds out 1 coin, B holds out 5 coins;
so B scores a win
- A now has 6 coins, B has 4 coins; A holds out 2 coins, B holds out 1 coin;
so A scores a win
- A now has 4 coins, B has 3 coins; A holds out 2 coins, B holds out 1 coin,
so A scores a win
- A wins the game because he is now two wins ahead

If anybody knows a name for this game or one like it, or has any other
relevant information, please let me know.
Thanks very much!
