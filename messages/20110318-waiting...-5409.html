Anybody waiting for the results?   : )

Today I managed to organize 4 different people to play the games.
Tomorrow I have a game session appointment and Saturday a friend is
going to step in at my work so that I can meet with her friend while
she takes over my shift for the duration of the games. I have a house
guest who just recently got the abstract itch so I hope to sway him
into joining the jury.

I've mostly been the person who plays the games with people since
getting people in a group to play abstracts is like telling people
that we should all hang out in the cold together.  Today though, I
watched (while playing someone else) as two people played a few of the
entries.  From delight to disdain they fumbled with rules and worked
out rough ideas of how to approach each game.  That was pretty cool.

I find that although discovering strategies can be a sweet process.
It's also nice when someone can show you ahead of time what each game
is capable of on an intermediate level as not to pummel them, but more
to give them an idea of where deeper thinking can lead you, what
options open up when movement isn't so random anymore.  Both playing
me and each other I think is good.  This has seemed to spur a bit of
interest in abstracts at the Spielwiese, which is great. Maybe more
people will come to the Monday night abstracts workshop.

Abstracts take time to root (obviousness noted).
This is apparent as I watch people in different stages of learning
these games.  First impression, desire for another game, desire to go
deeper into the strategy and of course reaching one's saturation point
then taking a break and getting back to the games another day.  I've
noticed that at the very most people will play 4 different games in
one setting.  Some only 1 or 2 because they really want to put a lot
of thought into a game before learning another rule set or time is
simply an issue.  A proper analysis of these games of course takes
time.

It's great watching people play all of these "very odd to normal
people" games and listening to them discuss each game in detail. "The
strategy in... is definitely to... because if you look at it this way
the only thing which keeps a player from... is..." or "no that will
never happen, because it will always play out where..."

I'm looking forward to the results!  I said that I'd finish off with a
video, but I don't know if I'll have time before I travel to Dublin on
the 24th.  I'll try to squeeze it in, but don't get your hopes up.

I won't give any hints as to which games are getting what responses,
but I will say that I'm pretty surprised that the majority of games in
the contest are so good.  If I was voting it'd be a tough decision
which is good news for my new r.g.a. stacking game collection.
