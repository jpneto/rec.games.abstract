A few days ago, I posted to this group asking if anyone used the
"layered" approach to solving the Rubik's cube.  I wanted to record
the moves that I remembered from my teen-age years, and possibly
find the moves that had escaped me.  Many thanks to Michael Keller 
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:Wgreview@aol.com">&lt;Wgreview@aol.com&gt;</a>, whose well-composed e-mail responses made this
task a breeze!  So sorry that my explanations are not as well written.

#####################################################################

This approach involves solving the cube in layers.  A picture, please:
OK. so the picture is not too good.   :-)

			  ____________
			 /__ /__ /__ /

The moves are recorded by face turns: Left, Right, Up, Down, Front, Back.
F means turn the front face 90 degrees clockwise.  F- means 90 degrees
counterclockwise.  F2 means a 180 degree turn.  Be careful, moves on the
Down face and the Back face may seem backwards!

TO COMPLETE THE BOTTOM LAYER
----------------------------
I have not formalized this section into moves.  Instead, I just use,
as one e-mail response called it, the "common sense" approach.
Pick a side.  Solve it.  Move the corners and edges so they match
the center blocks.  Position the cube so the solved face is on the
bottom AND LEAVE IT THAT WAY.

Beginners should note that the center blocks are always stationary, 
and the corners and edges move around them.  It helps if you take a
cube apart to see how it works, before you try to solve it.


#####################################################################


TO COMPLETE THE MIDDLE LAYER
----------------------------
There are only two moves needed.  You will be trying to move "edge"
blocks from the top layer to the middle layer (obviously, there are
no corner pieces on the middle layer).  In these moves, you rotate
the entire cube so the space you want to fill is in the FRONT-LEFT
position (keeping the solved face on the bottom).


FRONT-TOP to FRONT-LEFT (if color on TOP of block matches FRONT face)
F U2 R U- R- U2 F-

RIGHT-TOP to FRONT-LEFT (if color on TOP of block matches LEFT face)
F U2 R U R- U2 F-


#####################################################################

The top level is the hardest.  This is because you have less room for
error.  Before, when you were solving the bottom layer, you did not
care what other parts you messed up.  Now, you must be very careful
to move the top layer pieces around without screwing up what you have
already done.

THE ROTATION OF CORNER PIECES
-----------------------------
CLOCKWISE rotation of the FRONT-RIGHT corner
R- D R F D F-
immediately move the second piece to the FRONT-RIGHT corner
F D- F- R- D- R


THE FLIPPING OF EDGE PIECES
---------------------------
flipping the TOP-FRONT piece
F U D- L2 U2 D2 R
immediately move the second piece to TOP-RIGHT
R- U2 D2 L2 U- D F

YOU SHOULD BE DONE BY NOW.  :-)

SUPER-EFFIECIENT FLIPPING/ROTATING MOVES
----------------------------------------
This section was submitted by Michael Keller <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:Wgreview@aol.com">&lt;Wgreview@aol.com&gt;</a>.

If you want to keep memorization to a minimum,
your method does a good job of solving with
reasonable efficiency.   If you want a little
more efficiency at the cost of learning some
extra sequences, you can learn some sequences
which do multiple corner rotations and/or
edge flips at the end.   The most useful of
these are (+ indicates a corner which needs
to be rotated clockwise, - counterclockwise,
+ also indicates an edge to be flipped) :

	 +---+---+---+    
	 | - |   |   |  
	 +---+---+---+  
	 |   |   |   |
	 +---+---+---+
	 |   |   | + |
	 +---+---+---+

Twist front-right corner clockwise and back-left
corner counterclockwise on top (Up) layer
U2 F L- D2 L F- U2 F L- D2 L F-

     This routine was discovered by Erno Rubik
himself -- note that the first six turns are
simply repeated to complete the sequence.  If
the corner which needs to be twisted
counterclockwise is the front-left corner, do
an L before (to put it at the back-left position)
and an L- afterwards; if it's the back-right
corner, do a B before and a B- after.

	 +---+---+---+    
	 |   | + |   | 
	 +---+---+---+ 
	 |   |   |   |
	 +---+---+---+
	 |   | + |   |
	 +---+---+---+

Flip front and back edges on top (Up) layer
L- R B L- R D L- R F2 L R- D L R- B L R- U2

      Another of Rubik's own routines.  It's
easier to remember if you think of it in terms
of slice moves : L* U L* U L* U2 R* U R* U R*
U2; where L* is a move of the middle slice
between L and R, in the same direction as an L
move (towards you); R* moves the same slice in
the opposite direction.   If the two edges to
be flipped are adjacent, hold them at the
front and left, do L B- to put the left one
at the back, so the same routine as above, and
do B L- to finish.

Twist three corners clockwise and flip two edges
R- U- R2 B- R- B2 U- B- U2
[Or twist the same three counterclockwise :
U2 B U B2 R B R2 U R -- the same sequence in
reverse]

     A powerful routine which fixes five pieces
simultaneously.  It can be set up with the pieces
to be fixed in different positions, e.g. :

	 +---+---+---+    
	 | + | + | + |  
	 +---+---+---+ 
	 |   |   |   |
	 +---+---+---+
	 | + | + |   |
	 +---+---+---+

(B- R-) R- U- R2 B- R- B2 U- B- U2 (R B)
