  &gt;Could those who are familiar with (chess) Kriegspiel, please give me
  &gt;their answers to the questions below.
  
  &gt;(1) Do you play the "are-there-any" option?      (a) yes  (b) no.

(a) yes
The reason for having this rule is simple.  Without this rule, a player may
simply attempt all possible pawn captures before attempting other moves.
Allowing the question simply saves time.  We play with a hand signal, so
that the opponent does not know if we have exercised this option.
  
  &gt;(2) If yes, and the answer is "yes", do you play 
  &gt;    (a) pawn capture is compulsory,
  &gt;    (b) 1 attempt only needed.

(a) pawn capture is compulsory.
This is the natural consequence of the above reasoning.  Otherwise a player
may gain information by means other than direct trial-and-error, which
violates the underlying aesthetics of the game.

  &gt;(3) Do you announce check
  &gt;    (a) with no further comment,
  &gt;    (b) by naming the direction,
  &gt;    (c) by naming the piece.

(a) with no further comment.
The same reasoning applies.  Let each player discover information only
through attempting various moves.  Giving additional information would seem
to favour the defender, since she may avoid stepping into greater danger.

For that matter, another option, (d), is to not even annouce check, since it
will eventually be deduced if no "normal" moves are legal.  Of course, this
would make it much harder for the attacker to hunt down the King, since she
wouldn't know when she found the target.

  &gt;(4),(5),(6) the same as 1,2,3;  giving your PREFERENCE, rather than usual style. 

1(a)  2(a)  3(a)  4(a)  5(a)  6(a)  [or 6(d), discussed above]
