WHAT IS LOGICALLY CORRECT?
==========================


Agon or Queen's Guard can be a good game if you use the correct rules.

If you have never heard of Agon, you can find out more about the game:


Agon or The Queen's Guard. In: R.C. Bell. Board and Table Games from Many
Civilizations (Vol. 2). 1969, pp. 61-3.

Agon. In: Cassel's Book of Sports and Pasttimes. c. 1890, pp.382-3.

Karl Scherer. Zillions of Games - Queen's Guard (from Waddington's
Illustrated Encyclopedia of Games)
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/queensguard.html">http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/queensguard.html</a>




Scherer and Waddington are giving other rules than Bell and Cassel.



MY GOAL: TO FIND OUT WHICH RULES ARE CORRECT.
---------------------------------------------



(1)  LOGICAL ANALYSIS


WADDINGTON'S RULES             |          BELL'S RULES
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                            | same |
                            --------
1. Sandwiched pieces must jump at the next move.
2. The difference between a sandwiched Guard and a sandwiched Queen is
   that a Guard can be placed on any vacant space in the outermost row
   whereas a sandwiched Queen can be placed on any vacant space on the
   board (henceforth called: the DIFFERENCE).
3. Strategical Rule: The closer a piece to the center, the better for the
   owner of this piece (henceforth called: the STRATEGY)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         | different |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION:
===========

The DIFFERENCE only makes sense if the attacked player decides where to
place his sandwiched pieces. For that reason it must be assumed that
Waddington and Scherer give the wrong rules, whereas R.C. Bell gives the
correct rules.

At least it can be proved that Scherer's Queen's Guard rules are logically
inconsistent and therefore should be discarded.



(2) SOURCE ANALYSIS

Waddington's book was first published in 1975 and gives no source of his
rules of Queen's Guard.

Bell's book was first published in 1969 and gives a source which was
published in c. 1890.

I hold Master degrees in Cultural Anthropology and Religious Studies.

A scientific approach would be to consider the older source to be more
reliable, in particular, if this source is based on a known (!) source
which is even much older (!!).



CONCLUSION
==========

A standard approach would be for a social scientist to dismiss Scherer as
being a reliable, trustworthy source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Other rules of Agon which are often omitted:

(1) To avoid draws by repetition of moves a piece may not move forth and
    back on the same ring (i.e. may only move in one direction) as long as
    not at least one piece of the same color has been moved forwards (i.e.
    to the center) or jumped.
(2) You may never move or jump on a vacant space which is sandwiched by
    enemy pieces. However, you may sandwich an opponent piece by jumping
    to an adjacent space.
(3) If a player's six guards occupy the inner circle surrounding an empty
    space, the player loses the game, as neither player can achieve the
    game's object.
(4) A player loses the game when he cannot make a legal move.
(5) Draws appear to be impossible (?).
