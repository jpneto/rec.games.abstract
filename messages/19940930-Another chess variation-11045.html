This chess variation seems to be quite interesting. I played a few
games and it seems to work well. If anyone can comment on this...

All rules of normal chess apply. However, Hyperspace is added to the
board. Hyperspace borders all border fields: it is all the space
outside the board. Every piece except the King may move from the board
to Hyperspace if it can reach the border of the board with a legal
move. E.g. Qd1-Hyperspace is a legal move; after black's move, Q
hyp-h4 is allowed, but also Q hyp-e4, since the queen can reach that
spot with a legal move from the border.
 From e4 the queen can move back to hyperspace if there's nothing in
the way.
Note that pawns can never go to Hyperspace, since they cannot move off
the board with a legal move. 
Furthermore, a knight in Hyperspace cannot reach e5 or c5.
A few more rules apply:

	- Pieces can stay in Hyperspace as long as the player wants.

	- More than one piece can be in Hyperspace.

	- Pieces from both players can be in Hyperspace.

	- As a corrolary, pieces in Hyperspace cannot be taken.

	- A king may never move to Hyperspace

	- An opponent's piece may not be taken by a piece that comes
	from hyperspace directly.

	- Bishops may not change the colour of the fields on which they
	move when in hyperspace, so a bishop that moves on black
	fields must return to a black field.

Pieces in Hyperspace are put in front of the player on the table.

Moves from Hyperspace can be very surprising; A piece can suddenly
appear on the other side of the board. Sometimes, however, a piece on
the board can not be missed, and a piece in Hyperspace does not defend
other pieces.
It seems to be sensible to put the queen in Hyperspace in the
beginning of the game; then it can be sent in when and where needed.

I hope you like it,
Please comment!
