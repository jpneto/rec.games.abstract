It's practically impossible that this position is reached in an actual game, so that version is already more than playable. However, I don't like draws in general, let alone in connection games, and, with double moves and illegal diagonal connections, the game was already becoming similar to Vimbre. The solution was clear: I had to embrace this similarity and make it drawless by using the flipping mechanic from that game as well.

As a result, Trisq is now a simple Vimbre variant, but I think the special trapezium pieces make the game different enough as to justify a stand-alone release.

It's a nicely filled class of games by now. I've added Trisq to the somewhat hidden list in the Query rules, that evolved there because Query's rules left enough room to spare.

I'm too dull witted to risk any intelligent comment on the game. Moreover any such comment would predictably trigger third party reactions to the effect that I'm always too dull witted, and I'm too dull witted to answer that. If people were reading this stuff, it might be different ;-)
