The three formats for BoxOff that I like the most are 8x6 with three colors, 12x8 with four colors, and 15x12 with five colors.  It has been shown via random sampling that the probability of the first format having a solution is very high.  It has not yet been shown, but I strongly suspect that the same is true of the other two formats.

All three of these formats are implemented on Greg Schmidt's Windows program.  He came up with a clever algorithm that 100% guarantees a solution.  This gives the program a slight edge over the physical format, but I still like to play the old fashioned way as well :)

all very interesting, thanks

I agree with Mark that it's a good idea not to be too stringent about what is posted here, as long as it involves a high degree of tactical and/or strategic interest.  This will help keep us all open-minded.

true. I probably just won't be able to stomach the non-combinatorial stuff myself.

By the way, I'm having difficulty replying directly to people's posts.  The only way I can post is by typing over my original post.  Is there something I'm doing wrong?

I wish i could tell you something, but i really have no idea.
