Ralf Gering (bgg excerpt): "Again you prove that you have no
understanding of the game. These Checkers draws might be disappointing
for the public, but they are the BEST play, very close to perfection -
a perfect Checkers game is a draw."

Ralf, when perfect or even near perfect play is achieved, a game
ceases to be a game.  Many of the draws that occur in a match might be
played exactly the same way, the same sequence of board positions.
It's the equivalent of looking up moves in a catalog.  That's not a
game.

Ralf Gering: "Probably my last post as BGG is a North Korean website."

Way to go, Ralf.  :)  Bgg is a me-too convention.  Opinions aren't
tolerated.  Once Mistress Octavia catches your scent, you're done at
bgg.
