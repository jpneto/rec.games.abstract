Interesting similarity, Alex Hammel.  Of course Jogre Octagons doesn't have variable orientation cell division, but interesting nonetheless.  



So now you're spending your days filtering through thousands of games to try to find similarities with MSG games?  If only you could design games as well as you research them.



Find a similar game to Oust.  That should prove a little more challenging..  Connection games are dime-a-dozen.

Oust alors!!!
Do you know Genesis?

Do you know Othello?

What is Oust introducing new?
Massive capture???
It seems to me that you are obsessed by 2 things :
- Drawless games. You are too dumb to understand that a game with one winner advantage either (player 1 or player 2) is nothing more that draw game if you play alternatively 2 games. In otpimal conditions assuming that the is biaised toward the first player then player 1 will win the first and player 2 will win the second game. 
There is a general solution to any biaised game.
Fair solution not pie or swap rule. Pie rule is fake solution. Even ko rule is fake solution. 
Mathematical solution!!! I will not give it you. Try to find it.

- Eliminate and annihilate your opponent. There are mathematical solutions for a game to be indecidable where the 2 players "could win". If you take into account the time factor I mean the sequential playing during the game. At the instant t1 player 1 win (those are examples) but at the instant t2 the player 2 win. In optimal conditions. At my knowledge no one until know invented such game except me. You eliminate almost all your opponent pieces but few and your opponent will annihilate all your pieces but few .... and so on. The game will never unless you rule timing. The winner is the one who win one hour from now (for example).

I`m not Alex Hammel nor even Hazen Abouricha.
I`m just an internaut.
