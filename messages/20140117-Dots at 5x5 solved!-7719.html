About [20 hours and] 30 minutes ago, the shark completed its proof that 5x5 dots and boxes is a win for the first player.

Next step:

Verification and writing something for publication.
"""

"""
The shark has only proven eight moves to be winning (all the same move with symmetry), but I suspect that at least 48 moves are winning, and possibly all 60, based on how strong the player one position is in most lines.

Yes, it is 13-12.

Roughly 30,000,000,000,000 positions in the endgame database, with fewer than 400,000 positions in the opening book. I've been working on the database for about 8 years. On my new computer it would take about 1 year to re-create the database from scratch.

The Shark is a computer program written and operated by William Fraser.

Congrats to William for a big milestone!
