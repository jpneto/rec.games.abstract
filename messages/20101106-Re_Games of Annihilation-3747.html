Radiolarians is a game of annihilation and I'll release it when I'm
good and ready champ. Mad Bishops sucks, that's a given. Cage doesn't
suck, it's just not worth prattling on about 9 months after its
initial release insisting that a disinterested public should care. How
many games do you make in a single year that aren't pointless hex-like
connection games? At most it's 1 game a year. You can call me a 1-hit
wonder when a whole year has gone by and I haven't made anything, got
it asshole? I'm not worried about deterring anyone from the group.
Anyone who can deal with a year of your shit can certainly deal with
me telling you to fuck off and whatnot. Stop trying to blame the low
traffic on this site on other people! It's your fault this site is
dead, so just own up to it and take a LONG hiatus from internet usage,
it's obviously not something you're very good at.
