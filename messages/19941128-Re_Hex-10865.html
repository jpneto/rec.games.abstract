Isn't it possible to prove, in a more general way, that playing to the
center of an NxN board (N odd) is always a win for the first player?
It cannot be a draw, and having the first move cannot be a disadvantage
for the first player (since the game is monotonically increasing), so
it is a win.  All that needs to be shown is that playing to the center
hex is at least as good as any other move, which seems obvious, at
least intuitively.

What you have just argued is that the center move seems intuitively
likely to win.  Everyone understands that.  The difference between that
and a proof is rather vast.  The lacuna is that little matter of
"playing to the center hex is at least as good...."

It's like looking for a proof that moving first is an advantage in go.
That is obviously true, and from experience we can even quantify the
advantage fairly precisely.  But a proof is not only not forthcoming, it
is so far beyond what we know how to prove as to be completely
inaccessible.
