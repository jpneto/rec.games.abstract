I think it would be difficult to modify the chess rules to a Penrose
tiling. What is a diagonal move? What is a knights move? What is a
straight line? etc.

An easier (and more interesting?) possibility would be to make Penrose
Go. It would probably be best to use the variant of Penrose tiles that
consists of two rhombic tiles. Here is a suggestion for rules:

  1) The board is laid: The players alternately draw tiles from a bag
     and place them where they touch as many of the already placed
     tiles as possible. If that leaves several possibilities, the
     player can choose freely among those. When a certain number of
     tiles (e.g. 100) are placed, the board is complete.

  2) Then the game plays just like traditional Go, but playing pieces
     on the tiles rather than the corners. The freedoms are across
     edges, so each piece has four neighbours as usual.

The reason for the requirement of maximum connectivity in rule 1, is
to make the board more regular, i.e. reducing the number of holes etc.

I think a board of the same size as normal Go (361 nodes) is too much
for Penrose Go. The size of the board alone would be a hindrance. I
think the added complexity of the geometry is sufficient to make an
interesting game with about 100 tiles. One could make a predetermined
number of each kind of tile, e.g. 34/55 or 55/89 to make it close to
the golden ratio.

P.S.
Note that marketing such a game could yield copyright problems, as I
believe Penrose has copyrighted the design of the tiles. It would, of
course, be possible to make your own variant of the tiles (still
having the nonperiodic tiling property). I believe many variants are
possible using the golden ratio / multiple of 36 degree angle scheme.
