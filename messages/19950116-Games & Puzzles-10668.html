     I had my doubts, but now I'm prepared to say it confidently: 
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Games &amp; Puzzles<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> is back!  The original <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>G&amp;P<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> was the best games
magazine ever published in English, and its loss left a hole that
at least three British puzzle magazines have since tried to fill,
only to perish after a few issues.  The new <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>G&amp;P<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> looks as though
it might finally succeed.  It seems to be attracting plenty of
advertising, at least.  So far eight monthly issues have made it
across the pond, starting with April 1994.  Each issue is 48
pages, counting the covers, A4 format (roughly 8�"x11�").  There
are regular columns on chess, go, bridge, checkers, backgammon,
computer games, role-playing games, and (less often) play-by-mail
multiplayer games.  Every issue has a couple of pages of puzzles;
two pages of cryptic (British-style) crosswords; a number of
prize puzzles, including a few each issue serving as game ads
(the monthly Scr*bbl* puzzle, for example); a do-it-yourself
page, about making your own games and puzzles; several pages of
game reviews; and several pages of gaming event listings and
classifieds, which will not be of much interest to US
subscribers.  There are monthly columns by David Parlett (on card
games) and R.C. Bell (on whatever game matter comes to mind). 
And each issue there is an original game by the German inventor
Reiner Knizia; most thus far have required no equipment but a
deck or two of cards or a few dice.  I haven't played any of them
but for the most part they look good.
     Some of the highlights of recent issues, not including the
regular features above except as noted:  1 - a simple-looking but
tough maze by Robert Abbott; the most interesting new commercial
games of 1993.  2 - a report on games at the 1994 American
International Toy Fair; how to play Monopoly like a pro; Bell on
the national game of Nepal, Baghal Chal (Springing Tiger);
Pritchard on Amazons; a logic game by Eric Solomon.  3 - C.K. Lai
on Xiangqi.  4 - Scr*bbl* tips, European GenCon (role-playing
convention).  5 - mazes, the World Poker Championship.  6 - the
true origins of Monopoly, Sid Sackson's Solitaire Dice, Bell on
Nine Men's Morris.  7 - Hallowe'en party games; GenCon in
Milwaukee; playing Britannia, a four-player board game, to win. 
8 - gift recommendations, Diplomacy.
     So far I'd say it's not quite up to the old <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>G&amp;P<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, but it
certainly is good; I recommend it.  Updating the information in
July OP:  Subscriptions from Games &amp; Puzzles Ltd., 321 Essex
Road, London N1 3PS, England are �19.95 for one year, �34.95 for
two in the UK; $44.95 and $84.95 in the US and Canada.  All back
issues are available for �2 each postpaid, �9.99 for any six; I
imagine that that would be about $4.50 and $22.50 US.  You can
also backdate your subscription to any issue from #1 on.  You can
pay with a check (in $ or �) drawn on a UK bank, but the easiest
way is probably by credit card:  send card name (MasterCard,
Visa, or Amex), card number, and expiration date.
