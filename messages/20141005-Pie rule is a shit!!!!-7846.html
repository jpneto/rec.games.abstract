When I read what game designers think and say about the pie rule I feel really angry.
Pie rule is a proof that the game itself is somewhat unblanced. So it is inherent the game.
Now how to balance any game fairly?
The best solution is to play the SAME game on 2 boards AT THE SAME TIME.
Board A and board B.
The players are going to make the first move simultaneoulsy.
Player A on the board A and player B on the board B.
Players take their turns simultaneoulsy on the 2 boards.
The first one to win on any board is the winner.

Yes! I know that it is too hard to play 2 presumed hard games requiring to focus on the 2 but that is the only way to solve fairly the problem once for all.
I did it when I presented my little game "Blocking game".
2 boards! 
Try it with chessgame or checkersgame!
