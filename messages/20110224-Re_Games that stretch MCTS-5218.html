Hi,

I'm doing a bit of work on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which is a
new AI approach for move planning in games. The algorithm behaves
differently for games with different characteristics - some games are
well suited to it while some resist it - and I'm interested in finding
the outliers.

Can anyone suggest games of reasonable complexity that exhibit the
following properties:

1. Unusually slow to calculte legal moves for a given position.
2. Unusually slow to apply a move to a given board state.
3. Fast to find Nth legal move (e.g. Gomoku).
4. Slow to find Nth legal move (e.g. Triskelion?).
5. Fast to perform short lookahead (e.g. 2 ply) on a given position
(e.g. Gomoku again).
6. Slow to perform short lookahead on a given position.
7. Unusually low branching factor.
8. Unusually high branching factor.
9. Long move sequences for either player (e.g. Chinese Checkers).
10. Delayed reward, i.e. positional strength not clear until the end
of the game (e.g. Omega, maybe Othello?).
11. Immediate reward, i.e. immediate positional evaluation is a good
indication of who will win.
12. Random playouts give good estimate of who will win.
13. Random playouts give poor estimate of who will win.
14. Games in which a win or loss is never far away, i.e. high ratio of
leaf nodes in the search tree (Palago?).
15. Games in which a win or loss is very remote at the beginning but
gets closer as the game progresses (Hex?).

Basically any game that will affect the performance of MCTS/UCT by its
very nature.

Thanks,
Cameron

Hi Cameron,

We may have discussed this before, but I suggest looking at Cluster:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22004/cluster">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22004/cluster</a>

I experimented with a UCT player for that game and it did poorly.  The
goal of the game is to have all pegs placed at a particular hole depth
and forming a connected group.  I think UCT has difficulty with such a
specific goal, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.  I don't
doubt that UCT could play the game and potentially play it well, but
it seems to me, that in order to do that, some form of domain
knowledge (e.g. a partial connectivity metric) would be necessary for
a game such as this.  This observation could extend to the class of
games where reaching a specific "needle in the haystack" configuration
of pieces is the goal.

I do wonder about Chess and Chess like games as well.  I haven't found
any literature concerning the applicability of UCT to those sorts of
games.

Let us know what you find out!
