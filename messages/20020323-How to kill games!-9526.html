Most reviewers of abstract strategy games (i.e. "Denkspiele", "Jeux de
Reflexion") don't know what they should look for when they "determine"
the quality of a game. The same is true for many people who invent games.

For a long time I try to define the minimum conditions which a game should
meet to be worth my time and efforts.

One of these conditions is:

THERE SHOULD NOT BE A SIMPLE WAY TO ACHIEVE A DRAW.



Examples:

1.
Outwit
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/outwit.html">http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/outwit.html</a>

--&gt; About a year ago I wrote an e-mail to Mark Thompson called "How to
    outwit Outwit" in which I explained why Outwit is a drawn game. The
    strategy was later published by Joao Neto:
    "I do find a structural problem in Outwit. A player can force a draw,
     by surrounding the enemy base with his own stones. For e.g., the moves
     i1-d1, h2-d2, g3-d3, a9-a4, b8-b4, c7-c4 cannot be easily defended by
     the second player, which will be able only to enter his own King on his
     base."

Wayne Schmittberger's Halma (2 Players)

Schmittberger writes in "New Rules for Classic Games" (1992, page 89):

"While the original rules did not make this explicit, a player should not
be allowed to block his opponent's victory by leaving one or more pieces
in his home area indefinitely. Thus, it is necessary to add a rule that a
player wins any time, other than at the very start of the game, when the
starting area diagonally across from his own starting area is full of
pieces, regardless of who owns those pieces."

This embarassing nonsense was praised by many (I should better not
reveal their names) as an "elegant solution"!

Germans know for half a century (at least) that this "solution"
doesn't work. Why?

Each of the two players can reach the following position in the
first two moves:

.......
O......
OO.....
OOO....
OOOO...
.OOOO..
OOOOO..

This is White (lower left corner) after: a4-a6; a2-a4.
White can now move a1-a2; a2-a1; a1-a2 (etc.) indefinitely. There is
always an unoccupied square in his home (German: "Hof"), either a1 or a2.
Black cannot fill White's home, because two pieces cannot be jumped in one
jump.


3.
Rondo

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/CompleteGames/Connection/Rondo.html">http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/CompleteGames/Connection/Rondo.html</a>

Probably the most primitive game I've ever found, but I'm sure that the
reviewers of "Games Magazine" didn't see it!

First, this rather confusing board is topological identical with a 12x12
square board with the outermost ranks being "connected" (actually the
board constitutes the surface of a cylinder; compare to cylinder chess:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.chessvariants.com/boardrules.dir/cylindrical.html">http://www.chessvariants.com/boardrules.dir/cylindrical.html</a>).

The strategy to achieve a draw goes as follows:

Move every second piece straight forward.
Then move a piece on your first row (doesn't matter which one)
"clockwise on the circle".

Your opponent can no longer make a closed connection between what Freeling
calls "the inner and outer circle". If your opponent tries to do it, he
will automatically be forced into an eternal jump and lose.


--------
I estimate that about 20% of all games which are published described by
Zillions, Mark Thompson or Joao Neto can be killed using this method.
