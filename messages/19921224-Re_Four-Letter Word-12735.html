My sister taught me a variation of Mastermind that uses
four-letter words.  Each player has a piece of paper on which
he/she writes his/her four-letter word which the other person
has to guess.  The word may not contain double letters.

we called it "Four-Letter Word" and you were not prohibited from
using double letters at all.  it was great fun.  we used Scrabble Rules
for picking the words.  you would score a point for each wrong guess.
we used to play 3 rounds and add the 3 scores together to see who won.
in our version pots was no win for stop.*  we gave our answers back in the
Mastermind form of a-b where a is how many letters are right and b is
how many of those are in the right position.  so, in the above case, pots
for stop would get you a 4-0 answer.  if, however, it turns out later that
a guesser can prove an answer given is incorrect, then the answer player
only scores up to, but not including, that point and no further on that
word.  so you had be careful with the a-b answer.  later on we discovered
that there was no problem confining the length of the word to 4 letters.
it just added another level of points.  long words had their disadvantages,
as the guesses progressed, getting very confined in possibility very fast.
shorter words (&lt;4) had the weakness of being subject to brute force
algorithms.  later on i wrote a communication program for any number of
participants.  however, in this, i had the program compute the answer -
taking away that need to be careful.  this was so some of us could go
home and others would still be able to guess on their words.  this also
fit into a slogan i made up:

 "I dont like to win by getting my opponent to make a stupid mistake...
  I would much rather win by forcing my opponent to make an intelligent
  mistake."

* there are 24 ways to arrange 4 letters.  pots may hold the record for
having the most of those 24 be real words (Scrabble english):

opts  post  pots  spot  stop  tops (but not as in "you drunken psot":-)

any others like this?
