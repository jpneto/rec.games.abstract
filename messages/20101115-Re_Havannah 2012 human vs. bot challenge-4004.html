What would interest me is a comparison of the relative strenght of
computer programs in a large number of representative games, to see
whether this can lead to some kind of classification, and an insight
in what kind of games are more suited for the human mind, and in which
ones computers have the edge.

The first and foremost problem is to get a list of games for which
serious programs have been written. After that there are a lot of
parameters to take into consideration, such as the human player base
of a game, the human level of play, the amount of effort that has gone
into programming and the like.

Chess programs are now at grandmaster level, but in how far is this a
'coincidence' based on the massive amount of Chess- and programming
knowledge and the size and structure of the game?

Would Go, Hex or Draughts succumb to a similar massive effort?
Why does Monte Carlo beat the traditional evaluation in Go, Hex,
Havannah, but not in Draughts and Chess?
It's easy to see why Arimaa is difficult for computers, but why Hex?

Letting the mind do what it does is easy for strong players, but
formalizing it is very difficult, if not impossible: that's why
computer programs do not mimic the human mind but use totally
different evaluation methods.
Why can't we formalize what we do when we play?
