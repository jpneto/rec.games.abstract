Chmeee and fritzd are both highly intelligent Crossway players.  Black moved
first and yet White won.  If Crossway were a race as you claim, Black would
always win.  In fact nothing could be further from the truth.  With the
giant board, there are plenty of equitable starting points, which one would
select in observance of the pie rule.

Unfortunately this game exactly illustrates what I was saying. Black
abandoned his first move advantage and from move two played as if he
was the second player. He was totally unable to stop White's advance
(not even for a moment) and gave up after just 12 turns. If you call
this game an example of highly skilled play than I say it is
medication time for you.

Perhaps you should try your hand at some Scrabble variations? There
your talents would really shine. As for your abstract games designs I
regret to say that the emperor's clothes are missing and there is
little hope for improvement.

I never addressed my post to you personally. I was just hoping to see
some responses from people who have spent some time playing this game.
Only the author of the game replies... how sad.
