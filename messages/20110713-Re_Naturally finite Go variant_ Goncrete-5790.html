It's just a matter of consistency. It doesn't sound logical to me to

Is it? I'd think it is never unbeneficial. Say a life group helps
capturing one or more groups, then the resulting group doesn't need
the removal to live. Area scoring makes the result identical.

Yes, of course. In my head, I was putting 'beneficial' and 'not
unbeneficial' on the same level.

In my opinion, this is one of those little practical issues that end
up settled by convention. If Goncrete were an ancient game, as Go, I
guess making the removal when not necessary to live would soon have
been seen as a loss of time. Similarly, not making it when necessary
would have been deemed an absurd and illogical mistake. Thus, in the
end, custom would have made the eye-opener mandatory when necessary to
live and forbidden otherwise. I'm sure it wouldn't even be mentioned
in the game's notation.

Keeping this in mind, it doesn't really matter whether the eye-opener
is optional or mandatory, but I still find it hard to think of it as
something dependent on the players' will rather than inherent to the
capture mechanism. I'll ponder on it, though.
