Well since it's five levels, the ability of the first player to mount a
defense by using offense seems to be the neutralizing force. There are an
equal number of secondary value spaces of 16, which is analgous to the
opening moves of a chess game. Then the game really starts, which means the
players both have the same strategic positioning. This 8 piece matrix must
be worked with to create a fork.

When play gets up into 50 or 60 moves, the 5x5x5 matrix reveals it's
superiority from the 4x4x4 martix, in providing the three dimensional win
sequences. That is where the completion of a row forces the opponent plus
completes the second of a dual 3-way fork making the next move the
completion of the fork. This is kind of like a 3 move checkmate.

I do stand corrected on the number of winning combinations. I had errantly
taken the number of wins per plane by the number of planes = 252, not
accounting for overlap!. Now I think it is more like 75 straight lines + 20
diagonals + 4 transversals = 99?

Thanks everyone for this input.   This game is an all American Classic and
all of this input and suggestions will make it all the better!  Kids seem to
trive on the challenge because it seems to be something they already know
how to play, yet provides sufficient challenge to stimulate the abstract
challenge drive in most people.
