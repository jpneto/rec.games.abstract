Just a little parenthesis in your high-level discussion ;-) :

I think Eccentric Y and Hex Hex Y are conceptually interesting games,
as are, btw, most Mark Steere's games. Both of them, and specially the
second one, are IMO interesting efforts to solve Bill Taylor's
"perennial problem", but I still prefer to simply adapt Y to a
hexagonal board, as in the game I suggested (not invented) a couple of
weeks ago under the name Yex. In that game, as you will remember,
three non-adjacent corner cells are marked, thus defining three
perimeter sections which the player must connect to win. Every said
marked cell belongs to the two "sections" it touches.
