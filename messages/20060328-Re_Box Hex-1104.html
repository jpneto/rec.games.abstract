If you look at hex games between strong players (and both Kurnik and
Little Golem archive ALL their tournament games,) you see the winning
path meanders like a river across a flat plain. If the central region
becomes less important, the river will merely flow around it. And I
still don't follow how this would have any effect on the advantage
of the first move. Let's not confuse the most popular way to use the
first move advantage with the advantage itself.

I've modified my comments comparing Box Hex to regular Hex on the Box
Hex rule sheet.  My thanks to David, Nate, and Ed for your constructive
criticisms.  After all the discussion, I still do in fact feel that Box
Hex is an improvement.  If you compare a Box Hex box to a regular Hex
board, both of equal area, the Box Hex variant de-emphasises the
central area, control of which is paramount among expert Hex players.
Cell for cell, Box Hex simply provides more options by virtue of its
more complex three dimensional shape.

All of this is just my opinion of course.  I don't have any hard data
to back it up.  I've only played Hex once, and I've never played Box
Hex.  There may be unanticipated problems that crop up in Box Hex with
advancing expertise.  Wouldn't be the first time that happened to me.
