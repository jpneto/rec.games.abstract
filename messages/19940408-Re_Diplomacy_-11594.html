I was wondering if anyone would be interested in an e-mail game of Diplomacy

There are five automated Diplomacy Judges on the Net that I know of, each
with dozens of games going at once.  There are LOTS of Diplomacy players
out there.  The biggest Judge is <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:judge@morrolan.eff.org">judge@morrolan.eff.org</a>.

Diplomacy also has its own newsgroup, rec.games.diplomacy.

Also, I'd like NOMIC rules.  Someone said they had already been posted here,

Well, what exactly do you want?  There are almost as many flavors of Nomic
sets as there are Nomic games.  But the most prominent are Suber's original
F2F set, his email set, the Nomic World set, and the email set developed by
Chuck Carroll, which is the basis of at least two Nomic game on the Net,
including the one of which I am a member.

Also, there is a Nomic variant called Fantasy Rules, also played on a mailing
list.

I can send you addresses of the three Nomic mailing lists I know of, and the
list for the Fantasy Rules Committee.  I'll also be glad to send you the
Rulesets I can get my hands on...

Further, I understand that Nomic World (a defunct MUD for playing Nomic) is
going to be resurrected in the near future.
