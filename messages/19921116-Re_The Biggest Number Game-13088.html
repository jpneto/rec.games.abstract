But what is an exact specification on a sheet of paper???

That reminds me of a paradoxon, described by Rudy Rucker in one of his
books (can't remember the english title, it's a book about infinity in
mathematics, physics and philosophy).   Rucker asks:

Is there a largest integer number that can be described by 20 or less words?
(or 200 or less characters or any arbitray limit)

He gives a few examples and then states that this question cannot be answered
in sensible way.   If n would be the largest number that can be described
by 20 or less words then:

"The smallest number that cannot be described by 20 or less words"

is obviously a description for n+1 with less than 20 words.   And how about

"The smallest number that cannot be described by 20 or less words plus one" ?

Comments?
