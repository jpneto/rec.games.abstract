If you've invested in a 6-by-7 Connect-Four set, try Connect-Five.
It's a good, challenging game, and more exciting than Connect-Four.

The rules are identical to Connect-Four with two changes:
  (a) Five in a row win, not four.
  (b) Player drops two stones on his turn, not one.  Exception
     is that only one stone is dropped on the very first move, and,
     perforce, on the 22nd move if the game lasts that long.

It was almost 20 years ago that someone showed me this variation
(the one-stone first move to limit first player's advantage was
my idea).  Perhaps it was her own idea, because I've never come
across it again (except when I've introduced the variation to someone).

I don't know whether a win can be guaranteed, though a good computer
programmer should be able to answer that.  Perhaps I'll crosspost to
comp.programming.contests.

A few weeks ago I read about a similar game, maybe in the PBeM forum.
Variations of games in which the players make two moves on each turn
instead of one are called double-move variations, I think. It is common
to let the first player make only one move on his/her first turn, so
I doubt you were the first to come up with that - sorry. ;-) But in the
variation I read about, the goal was still to make only FOUR in a row.
I haven't tried these variations, so I can't tell if four or five makes
the better game.

I have played a few games of double-move Y against myself, and even on
a small board with only 27 nodes I can't tell who wins with perfect play.
So I would also like to hear from someone who can solve problems like
these with computers. The playing board is shown on

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.no.net/zamunda/images/y/y27.gif">http://home.no.net/zamunda/images/y/y27.gif</a>

(it is constructed along the same principles as the "standard" 93 nodes
board) and the goal is to build a connected set of stones that is
connected to each of the three sides (and like in Hex, it is guaranteed
that one player has won when the board is full).
