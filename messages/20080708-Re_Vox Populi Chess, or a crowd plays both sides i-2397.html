As I see it, if one person is left and he wins, then he should be the

I wouldn't try to balance it before I've tried it a bit. In the
scoring system I've proposed, the balance should come from

1. If you need to defect, you should do it as early as possible, to
get your share of the reward for all the later defectors.

2. If you're caught off guard and many team members leave your side
because of what you missed, you may be better off trying to make the
best out of it. If you should succeed in luring some of them back, you
will get a larger share of the reward.

Then the natural thing to do is to leave the point scores of the
individual audience members as they are.
