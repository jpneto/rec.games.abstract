I have created a new version of 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe that I believe does not have a
first-move-win solution!  I need help with solving this game if it actually
can be.  I would be willing to at least give you a free copy if you want to
help.

Is there a site where the specific rules are posted?  I looked at two of the
sites you posted and didn't find the exact rules.  Specifically, I most
interested in clarifying the details of this statement from pentagonal.com:

The center position can be declared a 'free-space' by placing a clear marble
there to start the game.ï¿½ For that matter, any number of holes can be declared
'free'.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Is placing a clear marble anywhere something that a player can do instead of
her regular turn?  Or is it just something that is done before the start of
the game?  If it's the latter, are you only interested in analyzing the case
where only the center space is free, or do you want to analyze any set of
free spaces?
