<br>Take a look at Cephalopod.&nbsp; People have commented that it's Chess like,

<br>their moves and take a long time.&nbsp; It's like watching a Chess game.
<br>I've also designed a couple of games which use a Checkers board, but

<br>&nbsp; Just tried it out. Pretty neat!&nbsp; I did think that the 3x3 game was
<br>actually more fun than the 5x5, because with the 5x5 there seemed to
<br>be more moves that were forced, or just "waiting for tempo" --- you
<br>know, when there are 7 good moves left, and you have to alternate
<br>placing pieces in those 7 spots before someone is forced to concede
<br>a "six" to his opponent, and the game can get interesting again.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; FYI --- this is obvious but might be worth mentioning anyway ---
<br>you don't need a bunch of dice to play Cephalopod, either. We played
<br>with stacks of Reversi (Othello) pieces, using chess pawns to represent
<br>immobile "sixes" so we didn't run out of pieces.
