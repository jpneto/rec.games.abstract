I'd heard someone mention in passing that there were some static evaluation

I'd be interested to hear what the static evaluation problems are.  

Branching factor:  I think this was hashed out a few months ago and I don't
have the messages any more.  I calculated about 7.5 or 8 by averaging
the data from a graph in Rosenbloom's AI Journal paper.

It would be interesting to see a planning approach for Othello (or for any
game), but I don't know of any good (ie, non-research) game programs that
do any kind of abstract planning.

Do you know of any references to designing planning approaches?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Only a few, in chess: "Using Patterns and Plans in Chess" by Wilkins, in the
AI Journal about a decade ago.  I don't have the reference offhand but I could
look it up.  It used a library of handcrafted plans.  I don't remember how
good it was.

Also Pitrat's work "A chess combination program which uses plans" in the AI
Journal (1977) No.8.

There are a few Machine Learning systems that learn plans for chess, but as
far as I know they are pretty limited.

What computer program competitions are held for Othello programs in the US?
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't know of any in the US, but the Waterloo Computer Othello Open is in
Canada.
