Actually, you posted here this last year (Nov 16, 2007) as "Quickway":

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/c92768f325f99a6b">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.abstract/browse_thread/thread/c92768f325f99a6b</a>


QUICKWAY
========
Played on a square quadrangular board of arbitrary size.


Players alternately place one of their stones (an unlimited supply) on any
free cell of the board.  Once placed, a stone is not moved.


The goal is for one player to connect the north and south edges by an
orthogonal path of stones (perhaps augmented by diagonal lines), and the
other is to connect east and west.


When stones of the same colour occur on diagonally adjacent cells, the
corresponding diagonal line is automatically filled, unless it would cross
over a previously marked diagonal.

Off the top of my head:


1) The game "TRELLIS" is played on a checkered board. BLACK connects
diagonally across only DARK squares, WHITE only across LIGHT squares.


2) BLACK connects on one diagonal direction, WHITE connects on the other.


3) The game "ONYX" suggests several methods that are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>opposite<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of first
come, first connect (aka Quickway aka Autoconnect, etc). Though it is played
on what amounts to a board of heptagons and squares, it's ideas can be used
on a 488 and 4444 boards.


In Onyx, a player can take a square cell if and only if all four neighbor
cells are empty.


If a player completes a 2x2 checkerboard, she captures the opposing two
pieces.


For example (using a 488 rather than the Onyx board for ascii-simplicity):

  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  X  |  O  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  O  |     |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---

Neither player may play in the square, as only 1 of its 4 neighbors are
empty.


If X plays in the lower right, she will capture the two O's, leaving this:


  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  X  |     |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|     |  X  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---

At this point, O can try to block, but X will still be able to connect:


  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  X  |  X  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---
 /   \ /   \
|  O  |  X  |
 \   / \   /
  ---   ---



This suggests to me several ways that might work on a 4444:


3a) Play only on cells. No captures. Player who completes a 2x2 checkerboard
wins the connection. Vertex is marked to show this.

Before:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
| O |   |
+---+---+

After:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---X---+
| O | X |
+---+---+


3b) As above, but diagonal connections are automatic, immediate and good
until overridden.

Before:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
|   |   |
+---+---+

O plays and is connected temporarily:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---O---+
| O |   |
+---+---+

Finally X connection breaks O's permanently:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---X---+
| O | X |
+---+---+


3c) As (3a) with captures. No play whatsoever on vertices. ALL connections
are orthogonal.


Before -- no connection:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
| O |   |
+---+---+

Then X plays to bottom right, capturing both O's -- still no connection:
+---+---+
| X |   |
+---+---+
|   | X |
+---+---+

O plays again in one of the two spaces just vacated:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
|   | X |
+---+---+

But X takes the last space, finally making a connection:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
| X | X |
+---+---+


3d) As (3b)+(3c) Diagonal connections are immediate.

At this point, O has the temporary connection:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---O---+
| O |   |
+---+---+

Then X plays to bottom right, capturing both O's, making her own temporary
connection:
+---+---+
| X |   |
+---X---+
|   | X |
+---+---+



3e) Full-on Onyx rules. The only way to get a vertex and connect diagonally
is to play a stone on a vertex. This may ONLY be done if all four squares
around it are empty. Completing a 2x2 checkerboard captures both enemy
stones.

I suspect the "vertex can only be played if isolated" rule is not really
required (in the original game or) here. A player will always have the
option of playing a cell to better effect:


It's O's turn -- Onyx rules say that O cannot play at the central vertex:
+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
| O |   |
+---+---+


But he wouldn't want to -- it's ALWAYS better to just make the orthogonal
connection:

+---+---+
| X | O |
+---+---+
| O | O |
+---+---+
