I  have done a quite a bit of expirimenting in determining winning strategies for
different sized hex boards.  I believe that Martin Gardner states in one of his
puzzle books that a 5X5 hex board is the largest where a winning strategy is
known from beginning to end.

Does anyone know if any progress has been made in developing complete
solutions for higher order boards?

I have developed a winning strategy for the first player on a 6X6 board and
am very close to having one for a 7X7.  Any references, information or
insights would be appreciated.
