ToadCup select one of your games every other year, Christian.  Are we to believe this is because you're such a great designer?  Don't hide behind your puppet "committee", Christian.  Come out, come out, wherever you are, lol

Although the site is in dutch, you may want to have another look: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.informaticaolympiade.nl">http://www.informaticaolympiade.nl</a> 

The facts (those things you can't dispute) are that they twice selected one of my games in twelve years and both times they approached me. I brought Ayu to their attention because it is simple and new and it seemed challenging. On the same grounds I might have brought Oust to their attention. But all things being equal except for you being a complete ass, I advised Ayu. I'm glad it was chosen but I had no say in the matter.

You seem to be grossly overestimating my sphere of influence. Not that I care, I'm now watching from the sidelines, and living happily ever after:
