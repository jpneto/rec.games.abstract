This cannot be true as any position on a N x 1 board clearly is a win
for the first player (a 'hot' position) regardless whether N is odd or
even.

Also, whilst a full 2 x 2 board indeed is a 'cold' position (a win for
the second player), a full 3 x 2 board is a win for the first player
as (s)he can reduce this position to a 2 x 2 board.
 
So: <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>if<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> there is a simple rule for full boards based solely on the
even/odd-parity of the size, then this rule has to be:

If N and M are even, then a full board is a win for the second player,
else (N or M odd) it is a win for the first player.


Torben's reasoning about symmetric positions (where the second player
copies the moves of the first player such that the symmetry is
restored) can be applied to all positions that contain a symmetry that
does not map any piece onto itself. So, the following end-game
positions are all a win for the second player ('cold' positions):

.. X
X .

X X
X X

.. X .                            . . X
X . X  which is equivalent to:   . . X
.. X .                            X X .

.. . X X
X X . .

X X X X
X X X X

However, also positions that do not satisfy the above requirement can
be 'cold'.

Examples are:

X X .
X X X
.. X .

X X X
X X X
X X .

(In both cases 2 pieces are mapped onto itself under the symmetry
operator.)

This doesn't imply that all symmetric positions with an even number of
pieces that get mapped onto themselves are 'cold' positions. A
counter-example being:

.. X .
X X X

So, no clue whether or not Bob's configuration 

X X . X
X . X X
.. X X .
X X . .

is a 'cold' one.
