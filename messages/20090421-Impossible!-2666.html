This game is played by two players.

Required components: One standard deck of 52 playing cards (no
Jokers).

Each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards.

A first player is determined.  The game then consists of the players
taking turns, where each turn consists of the following phases:

 1. The player takes three cards from his hand and places them face up
    on the table as a row of three cards, underneath or above the rows
    already played (if any).

 2. The other player can challenge this play by saying "Impossible!".
    See below for how this challenge is resolved.

 3. The player draws three new cards for his hand.  If fewer than
    three cards are available, all the remaining cards are drawn
    (which may be none).

At a challenge, the challenged player (the one whose turn it is) turns
over one card in each row.  If the remaining cards (in all rows)
includes both a red and a black card of the value, the challenge is
failed (and the challenger wins), but otherwise it is met (and the
challenged player wins).  A time limit (2-5 minutes) for meeting the
challenge should be imposed.

Below I use R and B for red and black, numbers 1 to 0 (for 10) and
letters N, Q and K for knave, queen and king.

Example: The following rows are played:

  R3 B3 R0
  B0 R3 B2

If challenged, the player can turn over B3 in the first row and B0 in
the second.  The remaining cards are R3, R0, R3 and B2, so there are
no value in both black and red.

If we add one more row:

  R2 B0 BQ

the challenge can not be met (try it).

Notes:

No single row can be responsible for failing a challenge, it is always
a combination of rows.  But just two rows can be enough to make it
impossible:

R1 B1 R2
R1 B1 B2

A game can not finish without getting to a point where a challenge
must fail.  The reason is this:

 - There are 13 values, each with two red and two black cards.

 - A non-failed challenge can have at most two cards of each value,
   i.e. at most 26 visible cards.

 - 51 cards yield 17 rows.

 - When one card is turned over in each of the 17 rows, there are 34
   cards left.

So already at the 14th row, the challenge is bound to fail.  But it is
likely to fail much earlier.

With N rows, there are 3^N ways of turning over a card in each row, so
determining whether it is possible to meet a challenge can take a long
time.  Hence the time limit on meeting it.
