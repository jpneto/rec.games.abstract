<br>Thanks for taking the time to read my post and reply.&nbsp; But you flatter

<br>Yes, I agree.&nbsp; You may wish to look at "A Journey In Search Of The 
Origins Of Go" by Shirakawa Masayoshi.&nbsp; That treats the role of 
divination in the development of Go at some length.

<br>What I'm getting around to is that a Chess-like game and a Go-like
<br>game were designed by two different individuals, people found them
<br>entertaining, and the games evolved, probably Chess more so than Go,
<br>while retaining their essential identities.&nbsp; The lineage of games is
<br>certainly interesting but that's all there is to it.&nbsp; This whole thing
<br>you went into about junior fellows at the Society of Fellows and the
<br>shortcomings of the Chinese intelligentsia is an utterly absurd flight
<br>of fancy.&nbsp; At least it seems like that to me.

<br>May I ask what evidence you looked at to come to that conclusion?&nbsp; May I 
suggest that you have a look at:

<br>What you will find if you read these sources, and others like them, is 
that many learned and experienced men, from a wide variety of 
discplines, business and the arts, as well as highly accomplished 
players of various games, all agree that
<br>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; board games can establish
<br>&gt;&gt; habits of mind and frames of reference and can form, reflect and

<br>
<br>I respectfully suggest, then, in light of the evidence, that this notion 
is not deserving of your criticism that

<br>&gt; This whole thing you went into about junior fellows at the Society of
