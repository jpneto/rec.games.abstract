Paul Colley asks:

I found the posted "rules" to LOA cryptic to the point of being
inscrutable.

Perhaps this is just one of my denser days, but I would be grateful
if you could Email me a more complete version (or, if it isn't just
me, you could post it).

I would be going from memory, and there are others who
are more up to date than I.  But I will try.

1) White places twelve pieces in parallel edges of a checkerboard
(excluding corners).  Black places his in the other two edges.

2) Players alternate moving, and move only one piece to a turn.

3) A piece moves in any direction the exact number of spaces as there are
pieces of either color (including his own) in that row, column or diagonal. 
He can move this number of spaces towards either end of the row, column or
diagonal if he is able (e.g.  if a piece is the only piece of either color
in a row, and is not at an edge, it may move one space to the right or one
to the left). 

4) A piece may jump over men of the same, but not of the opposite,
color.  The occupied squares count as a space.

5) A piece may not land in a square occupied by a man of the same
color.  If it lands on a square occupied by a man of the opposite
color it captures him.

6) The game is won by the first player who has all his remaining
men connected.  This means that that if one started with a square
occupied by one of his men, one could reach the square occupied by any
other of his men one square at a time so that all the squares 
in the path are occupied by men of his color.

7) Gamut of Games had a situation where a player connected by 
capturing, and in doing so left his opponent connected, as a
draw, but I am told that in NOST the rule is that the player
doing the capturing wins. 

I strongly recommend Gamut of Games as a source.  And I strongly 
recommend the game.
