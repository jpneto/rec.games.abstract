You?  I thought it was me who was relentlessly lampooning Monsieur Buffoon.

He'll be back, as soon as he dreams up another outlandish tale to impress everyone.  It started out simple.  He's a poet, he speaks 20 languages, he won a million dollars, has 1000 nicknames, etc.  When he failed to convince anyone, he ramped up the rhetoric.  Now he's so ingenious, he's in danger of being kidnapped and killed by a secret government agency.  Next it'll be a plagiarized Die Hard script.  He jumped off an exploding building and grabbed onto the skid of an out of control helicopter.

Where it's all headed, I don't know.  Monsieur Buffoon will eventually realize how ridiculous he is and it'll hit hard.  He'll drive to California in a VW bug he stole from the mall and shoot me in the head with a .22.  I'll still be alive but in a semi-vegetative state like Christian Freeling.  Then I'll finally realize how great Symple is.
