I'm just out of date.  Backgammon reminds me of a time in the 1770s,
when gentlemen of discernment and taste played backgammon and whist.

Yes, well . . . the public impression of what's "classy" does change
from one era to another, doesn't it?  (Of course, in the 1770s,
Benjamin Franklin was lauding all the benefits of chess too.)

I'd put it behind hnefatafl in that respect.  While chess usually has
the more finely sculptured pieces, one thing that attracted me to
hnefatafl was the pleasing radial symmetry of the pieces, as initially
set out for play on one of the bigger boards.

Hnefatafl would definitely be a contender.  But to me, the very size of
it tends to undermine its aesthetic value.  I find myself drawn more to
the compact than the expansive, generally speaking.

Also, the "radial symmetry" of the tafl games has always seemed odd to
me:  it looks like a four-player game, but it turns out to be a game
for two.

Then there's the asymmetry of roles:  one player is trying to do
something very different from the other.  Somehow that goes against my
grain too.

I must admit, I've done that with a lot of board games.  I've had to
start putting them away again as the plants and "real" ornaments take

Yes, well, there is that.  I used to leave wargames set up, gathering
dust for a long time.  But then again, in 1975-76 I used to visit a
store in LA where they sold chess sets with price tags in the thousands
of dollars (with one or two in the tens of thousands, IIRC).  I don't
think people buy those just so they can play chess.

It's kind of odd that I feel that way, though.  Checkers is more
compact and minimalistic than chess, so I ought to like it better for
those reasons.  But it's so starkly abstract that my imagination feels
left out every time I play.  I can't seem to connect the jump move (or
anything else about the game) with anything in real life, and that
bothers me.

In contrast, it's somehow easy for me to picture chess as a medieval
battle, despite the mobile castle towers and the superhero queen and
all the curious geometrical moves.  And because I can picture chess as
a stylized battle, I end up liking the game more.

But if we go just one more step toward "realism" and turn chess into a
more credible simulation of battle, suddenly it's not nearly as classy
anymore!  I was into wargames for many years, but I was never able to
think of any wargame as being in the same aesthetic league as chess.
The abstraction of chess makes it "bigger than life" in a sense,
whereas realistic wargames are merely literal representations of life.

I suppose an analogous pairing might be a Shakespearean play versus a
typical modern movie.  Shakespeare's work is somewhat abstract and his
characters "bigger than life," so his plays have a timeless quality to
them.  Modern movies, OTOH, are often topical--limited in time and
place so that their meaningfulness is less far-reaching.

A game like checkers (draughts) is perhaps more analogous to "modern
abstract art."  Mondriaan's work may be highly valued, but what does it
mean?  Since I can't mentally connect it with anything concrete, I'm
left wondering what statement (if any) it makes about life.  The
meaning of the work eludes me, and I have to rely on art critics to
interpret it for me.

So, I guess I don't like photographic realism, but I don't care for
pure abstraction either.  My taste runs to something in between.  And
among games, I'd say chess strikes that happy medium.
