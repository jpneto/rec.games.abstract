Sorry, I'm having a little trouble believing that when you make
statements like:

"How many possible moves in Oust does the player have in the second
turn? I think it's 120. In Ecalper, however, during the second turn
player has 930372 possible moves to choose from.

This, to me, is a strong clue Ecalper has a bigger game-tree
complexity than Oust"

You seem to be claiming that Ecalper has a vastly larger game tree
than Oust.  My response to your claim is that I seriously doubt it.
In Ecalper, both players always have about the same number of stones
on the board all the time.  That's a huge restriction.  So is the
seriously limited number of moves in Ecalper to 127 plus one third.
Another huge restriction.  I think the Oust game tree shits on the
Ecalper game tree, but, like I said before, it's just a theory.  If
that seems like "competition" to you, then whatever.  Don't start
discussions about how huge your game's tree is if you're afraid of
getting refuted.

Large game-tree is a strong clue about the game depth, but you are
right that is not a sufficient condition.

Anyhow, I assure you there is no redundancy in my calculations. I have
considered rotations, inversion, and order.
