About everything I'm afraid. White on his first move would have to
drop to singles or pass (and if he keeps passing, does he win with 0
groups?). You don't have that 'passing' problem in the current
version.
If that were settled (extra rule), black could keep clogging and white
would have to stop him with 2 or 4 groups to force black to drop
another two singles ... doesn't feel good.

my head and they look tantalizing.
