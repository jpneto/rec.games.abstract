You can define a "step" in playing ability
so, that you can beat 75% of opponents
which are one step below.

Gang, I've been thinking about it and I don't see why a full step in
playing ability shouldn't be one who is able to win 60% of his/her
games, not 75%.  (And one can even argue steps should be at 5%
increments... and thus the first step would be a player who wins 55% of
the time.)

If two players play a series of chess games (for example) and over many,
many games, one player is clearly winning 60% of the time, then this
player is surely a slightly stronger player and thus is step up than the
other.  Not much of a step perhaps, but his/her 600 wins over the others
400 wins, (after 1,000 games) is a clear margin.  I think 75% is too
great to determine the next step.

If this is agreed upon, then chess would have about 17 or 18 steps, if
we start our first level at a rating around 1000.  (I've never known
anyone with a lower legitimate rating, over a period of many games, than
this.)
