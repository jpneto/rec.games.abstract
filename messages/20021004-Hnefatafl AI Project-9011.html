<br>
<br>I came on this newsgroup to ask if anyone knows about a game called 'Hnefatafl' to discover that 
you're having a discussion on it. You see, I am taking an AI class in which there is a project to 
write an artifically intelligent Hnefatafl player. Everyone in class must implement a player, then 
we will play our players against every other player once, in a round-robin style tournament at the 
end of the term. Maybe someone from class got the idea from this newgroup?
<br>
<br>Anyway, I am looking for strategy books, discussion groups, or resources on the strategy of this 
game, so as to make my AI player a little more "informed".
<br>
<br>Any idea where I can start?
<br>
