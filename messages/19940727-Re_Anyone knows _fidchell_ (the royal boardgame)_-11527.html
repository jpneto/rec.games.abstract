Actually, there was a 3M "Bookshelf" game very much like this,in that 
there were two uneven sides,all pieces identical except for the king.I 
regret that I am unable to recall the name of this game was,although it 
was most enjoyable,and it seems to me that it was named after some sort 
of nautical conflict.Circa 1970.I realize this may not help with the 
Celtic origins of fidchell,but, on the other hand,3M must have gotten it 
from somewhere(as they have gotten many of their better"abstract"games 
from ancient folk games).
