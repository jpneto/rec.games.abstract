Well, thanks for replying Frank. Someone went to the trouble of setting up this
newsgroup, so someone should use it.

Universe is an old Parker Brothers game that has since gone through various
reincarnations. Here's the rules for the two-player variant: The board is a
10x10 grid of squares. Each player has a collection of 12 distinct shapes
called pentominoes. Just as a domino is two squares joined edge to edge, and
the game tetris uses tetrominoes which are groups of four squares, pentominoes
are groups of five squares joined at the edges. There are 12 ways to make a
pentomino. A popular puzzle asks you to arrange these 12 shapes into a 6x10
rectangle. Anyway, each player has his/her own color. The board starts empty.
Players alternate moves. A move consists of placing one of your remaining
pentominos on the board, aligned with the squares, subject to these
restrictions: You may only play on vacant squares, and you may not "fence off"
a region of less than 5 vacant squares. "A region" means a group of vacant
cells that are connected horizontally and/or vertically. At the beginning,
The entire board is one big 10x10 region. It would be illegal to play the
+ shaped pentomino in the corner, since this would fence off a region of 1 cell
in the corner. I hope this makes sense. The object is to be the last player
to make a move. The game is usually over in 20 minutes or less. It is possible
to lose on the first move, by making a move that occupies only one of the 4
center cells. The second player could then make a rotationally symmetric
reply, and this symmetry would be unbreakable.

Qubic is also Parker Brothers I think. It's 3-dimensional tictactoe. The
board is 4x4x4. Levels 2,3,4 are transparent. The object is to get 4 in a
row, any kind of straight line. I wrote software for the Radio Shack Color
Computer (now defunct) to play this game. I called the game "Fourcube."

Go-moku and Renju are ancient Asian relatives to tictactoe, played on a Go
board which is a 19x19 grid. The object is to get 5 in a row. Gomoku has
simpler and more straightforward rules, and may be more appropriate for
newcomers to the game. There are no restrictions on where you may play as
long as the cell is vacant. You must get exactly 5 contiguous stones of your
color in a row to win. If you produce a line of 6 or more, say by joining
2 groups of 3 each to produce 7 in a row, you have not won yet. This is
called getting an overline. The first
player has a winning advantage, just as in Qubic. In Renju, the rules are
designed to counteract this first move advantage to make the game more
balanced. The first player has several restrictions as to where he/she may
play. If anyone is interested, I could send you the the rules to Renju as I
understand them, but like I said, Gomoku is the preferable starting point
for beginners.

So, you like Twixt Frank? I'm a bit of a fanatic about the game. I'm looking
for informal email opponents. Someone said the standard 24x24 game was not
very deep compared to the likes of Chess, Shogi, and Go. I agree. Anyone
for a 100x100 game? &gt;:)
