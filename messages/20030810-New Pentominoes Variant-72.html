Here's a two-player game that I came up with yesterday.
It seems to be fairly intriguing, and so I think this is
the group to post to.  It's a variation on "Pentominoes,"
which has been around for a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>long<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> time, but I think
this is a new variation.

The twelve classic pentominoes are the unique ways of
arranging five unit squares contiguously:

  FF            NNN   PP  TTT      V   W    X     Y  ZZ
 FF  IIIII    L   NN  PP   T  U U  V   WW  XXX  YYYY  Z
  F        LLLL       P    T  UUU  VVV  WW  X         ZZ

Make a set of these twelve shapes out of cardboard, or
Legos, or something.  I used corrugated cardboard and
unit squares of one inch, although since this game uses
a board, you should use whatever size the squares on your
favorite checkerboard are.


Materials.
  The 12 pentominoes.
  One 7x7 board (such as a truncated chessboard).
  Several (5-10 of each) black and white counters.

Rules.

  BASIC RULES

  The pentomino pieces are put into a "pool" accessible
to both players.  Players alternate turns.
  On a player's turn, he takes a piece from the "pool"
and places it in any empty area on the board.
  The first player to be unable to place a piece
on the board loses the game.

  NEW INTRIGUING RULE: CAPTURING

  If a player's move places a piece such that it
touches another piece on three or more unit sides,
the touched piece is "captured."  The capturing
player then puts one of his colored markers on
top of the captured piece.  Example:

    .......
    .......  Black plays the T.
    ..Y....  White plays the Y, which
    ..Y.T..    captures T.  He places
    ..YYT..    a white marker on the T.
    ..YTTT.
    .......

  If one player has captured a piece,
the other player may capture it back.
In that case, the first player's marker
is removed.  Example:

    .......
    .......  Black plays the U, which
    ..YUUU.    captures both the Y and
    ..YUTU.    the T.  White's marker
    ..YYT..    is removed from the T and
    ..YTTT.    Black puts his markers on
    .......    both pieces.

  At any time during the game, a
player may remove from the board
one of his captured pieces.  The
removed piece goes immediately back
into the "pool," with the restriction
that the player who removed it may
NOT use that piece on his next move.
Example:

Black U  TY/
White L   T/Y
Black V  TU/Y

    .......
    ....VVV  It is White's turn.
    ..YUUUV  White removes the Y
    .LYUTUV  from the board and
    .LYYT..  plays the Z.
    .LYTTT.
    .LL....

White ~YZ  T/LU

    .......
    ....VVV
    .ZZUUUV
    .LZUTUV
    .LZZT..
    .L.TTT.
    .LL....

  A player is allowed to remove more
than one captured piece at a time, and
may remove pieces at any time, even
though it usually only makes sense to
remove pieces immediately before one's
own turn.


That's all the rules.  In my very limited
play-testing, the second player won a lot
of the time - I don't know whether that's
really true if both players know the game
well, though.

Comments, kudos welcome. ;-)

Also, if anyone has any source code
for a Pentominoes-like game they'd like
to share, I would really like to get a
computer player (or just an interface) for
this game.

Thanks,
-Arthur
