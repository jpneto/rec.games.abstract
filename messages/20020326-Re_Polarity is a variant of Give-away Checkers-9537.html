Second, one could give the Lower and Upper Sides the same set-up of four
groups of negative pieces.  This change would balance both sides and
would force the use of more positive pieces, which is more in the spirit
of the game.

I do not really understand what you exactly mean with "the use of more
positive pieces".

Polarity will always remain in practice a variant of Give-away Checkers.
Whatever you chose as the initial set-up, getting rid of your own
negative pieces will always be far more easier than to capture your
opponent's positive pieces because it is far more difficult to
defend against an attacking negative piece (which wants to commit
suicide) than to defend one's own positive pieces which are attacked.
This doesn't depend on the initial set-up. Basically Polarity is a race
game: you try to get your negative pieces killed as fast as possible (there
are only 6, so it's not good to fall behind in the race). The positive
pieces are usually only used to get your negative pieces killed. I had only
one game, where a player had one negative piece left and had to play
cautiously, but he intentionally caused the situation himself because he
sacrificed all his other positive pieces to gain the lead in the race, and
he knew many moves ahead that he would win by losing all his negative pieces,
while having just one positive piece left.

First off, let me say that Polarity was never intended as anything more then a
novelty.  So lets not set too high of expectations from it.

Polarity is designed to be a game with two types of pieces, each with their own
purpose.  The game has two different goals that are opposite from one another. 
All this is meant to create tension.  It is not intended to be merely Losing
Checkers with some safe pieces mixed in.

Granted the main focus is on getting rid of one's negative pieces, yet the
positive pieces should have a role too.  To use an analogy, in a normal game of
Checkers the focus is ordinarily on capture.  However a player can also lose by
being immobolized.  In most games this usually more of a threat than a reality.
 Still this doesn't mean a player should ignore the risk of blockade.

As you pointed out, in one set-up a player would be able to move out all his
negative pieces and leave his positive pieces untouched.  The other set-up a
player would be forced to move some of his positive pieces to free up his
negative ones.  This would mean the positive pieces would play a more active
role in the game and in turn be exposed more to the threat of capture.  The
second set-up is more in the spirt of the game.

Another point to consider is you keep evaluating the game in terms of only
skilled players.  A good game should appeal to all levels of players for
different reasons.  A skilled player might appreciate the sense of novelty.  An
average player might find the game conditions more of a stumbling block, for I
have seen games where a player was so intent on losing his negative pieces that
he left his positive pieces exposed and ended up losing because of it.  Whereas
a casual player might not realize the importance of the negative pieces at all
and be challenged as he juggles back and forth between positive and negative.

That being said, I have heard from several people who have found the game (even
with the flaw you pointed out) to be intriguing and entertaining.  And that's
all I've ever asked from it.

However, just for theory, who wins when a player
loses his last negative and positive piece in the same move (by multiple
capture)? Is this a draw?

</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

If a player loses his last negative and positve pieces in the same move and so
fulfills both the win and lose conditions simulataneously, the two cancel each
other out and the game is a draw.
