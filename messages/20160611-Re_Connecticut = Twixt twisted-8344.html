Well in this case, the victim is me, being deprived of the adulation I so richly deserve (although of course not for Connecticut). I'm not sure how you decided that I am well liked by the BGG community. I have been one of the most irrascible and confrontational users next to you and Mark. I have butted heads with the real ayatollah, Christian Freeling on more than one occasion.  If one of my inventions is spontaneously praised on BGG, this should be viewed as being in spite of my personal profile not because of it. That goes doubly for Mark who has actually received ratings of "1" by people who haven't even played a game of his and only want to spite him. Conversely if your ideas are being entirely panned it's likely that they are not worthy of consideration or else they are explained poorly and used as a platform to hurl more unsolicited vitriol at the community. The difference is when Mark hurls unsolicited vitriol it's vitriol coming from a great designer when you do it, it's the ravings of a deranged narcissistic lunatic. Earn a reputation by the dint of your games and then go and accuse others for diminishing it.

First : I did not say at any moment that you are disliked. Even in any mafia some people dislike some others.
You are member of the BGG forum mafia.
Dishonesty is the main rule of this forum. No one member is honest! 
Second : I do not need any consideration except honest and constructive comments. I do not care about reputation inside the "game designer" community. Begging is a tool for crappy designers to be recognized (ReyAlicea is the best example). 
Third : If vitriol is criticizing games then what? Shutting up? I will not stop talking the way I want : Connecticut is stillborn game because it adds nothing to the game play (Twixt twisting is not creating). It is better to play Twixt (a crappy game).
