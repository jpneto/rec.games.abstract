This is just "Hexatol" that I described here some while ago,

Ohhhhhhh, so my game, Atoll, is now merely a part of your "parity theme" is
it?  Here are some quotes from your "Game variation: Hexatoll" announcement:

"This is a variant of Mark Steere's new game 'Atoll'."

"Thus, I propose "HEXATOLL", which is essentially just
Atoll played on a hexagonal board."

"Mark is to be strongly congratulated on discovering
the natural criterion for even-sided boards!"

But now Atoll has become just part of your "parity theme".  That's great.  I
need to get a loading permit for you riding around on my coattails all day.

HERE'S THE PROBLEM, BILL.  WHEN YOU RAN OFF WITH MY NEWLY RELEASED GAME,
ATOLL, AND MODIFIED IT INTO HEXATOLL, YOU FUCKED IT UP!!!!  YOU OVERLOOKED
THE ESSENTIAL WINNING CONDITION OF A Y BEING FORMED BETWEEN THREE EQUALLY
SPACED ISLANDS OF THE SAME COLOR AS THE Y.  THAT'S 50 PERCENT OF THE RULES
YOU LEFT OUT, YOU INCOMPETANT FUCK!!!!

HERE'S THE ONLY RULE YOU MENTIONED FOR THE GAME, BILL:

"As before, each player must try to connect one of his own rim regions with
a directly opposite one."

WHERE'S THE Y RULE, BILL??  WHERE????  NOWHERE TO BE SEEN!!!!  THAT'S
WHERE!!!!!!!

How many other games is this guy gonna try and steal!!!

How does modifying my own game, Atoll, qualify as stealing??  Because my

Yeah, you're gifting mutilated versions of my games to the world.  That's
the kind of "generosity" I can live without.  Flake off, game thief.  You
need to read the "Designers" box on my website.  It was written specifically
for game mutilating dipshits exactly like you.

Will you please design your own games and leave my games alone??  Seriously,
this is getting out of hand.
