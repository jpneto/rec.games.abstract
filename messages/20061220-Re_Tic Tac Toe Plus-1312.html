<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting Mitoshima's message of Sunday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>I have always looked at discovering new game ideas, however, in other 
to make something good and solid, if you know what I mean, I have to 
start with the fundamentals first and the reason why I chose the most 
popular Tic Tac Toe. Once I have mastered these fundamentals, I can 
then look further over the horizon, but for now, I'm keeping it low.
<br></blockquote>
<br>At one time I wondered why so many people released their own versions of 
tic tac toe into the world (or noughts &amp; crosses as I usually call it). 
It was some time later, as a budding writer of computer games, with a 
catalogue of too-ambitious half-finished projects, that I figured out 
why.
<br>
<br>You do right to start simple, though there is, to be honest, a limit to 
how simple one can go without writing something that nobody will play. 
Might I make a suggestion?&nbsp; With your modifications to tic tac toe, 
you're inventing a game as well as trying to code its AI.&nbsp; If you look 
at a book like Murray's History of Board-Games Other than Chess, or 
Bell's Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations, you'll find a 
great variety of very simple games that are much more playable than tic 
tac toe, whose strategies are already known, and which may generate a 
bit more interest.&nbsp; Three men's morris, four field kono, and mu-torere 
are examples I can think of without getting the books out.&nbsp; You'll find 
information about these on the internet too.
<br>
<br>But If you've put a lot of work into your tic tac toe game, then you'll 
probably want to see it through.&nbsp; In that case, good luck to you, I hope 
you have fun with it and that it leads you to more interesting projects.
