Yeah we got that, Korneliussen.  You said the exact same thing three weeks
ago on December 15, 2010.

"You know I primarily post here to help newcomers,"

The newcomers are still waiting for your help, Korneliussen.  Please
enlighten them, and the rest of the readership, as to what the fuck you're
even talking about.

Jim Albea has Plateau, a very well known and highly regarded game.  So what?
 Most would-be designers would love to have a game like that.  In my case, I
have a large portfolio of architecturally interesting but commercially
non-viable games including Oust, Atoll, Fractal and Flume.  These are the
sort of games you want to help budding designers avoid, Korneliussen?

Note: Harald Korneliussen is the number one cheerleader for the Gipf series.


Korneliussen, not everyone is in it for the money.  Sure, when I started
with Quadrature, I shrink wrapped it, went to a trade show, won a contest
(Mensa), and sold a few cases.  It just seemed like the thing to do.  Now I
intentionally use generic equipment like Go stones and hex boards.  It keeps
my games simple but also makes them commercially non-viable.

My reward is not money, Korneliussen.  My reward is the pleasure of
designing, primarily, but there's also the recognition I've earned for
robust architecture.  I don't release games susceptible to the type of
problem you detailed about Zertz on August 10, 2010.

"What is the bug in Zï¿½rtz? It's true that a lot of losing opening moves were
found, and that this prompted Kris Burm to add new rings. But this was after
Yoshi Ikkai figured out how to set up long chains of sacrifices..."

There's never a need to "add new rings" in a robust game with an unlimited
supply of Go stones.

Gipf cheerleader Korneliussen's advice to "would-be designers" and
"newcomers" is something we can only guess at, since in spite of all the
announcements, he refuses to actually dispense any.  But it would have to be
something like this:

"Make sure your game has a little tiny cellophane bag of proprietary,
cost-effective, pretty plastic pieces, the bare minimum necessary to make
the game function between beginners."
