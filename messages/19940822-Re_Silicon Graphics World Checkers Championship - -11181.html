   What a swell victory.  Chinook is "world champion" without winning a
single game.  USUALLY a challenger has to have a + score to claim the title.
   Resigning the match sounds like typical Tinsley sportsmanship.  After
all, in the previous match, he bent over backwards to give Chinook a chance,
then played under conditions that were highly favorable to the machine ---
which after all never suffers from fatigue.

They did suffer from a loss due to some failure with timing in the first
match. It was not clear whether it was their program or the hardware.
I quote from J. Schaeffer's account of the match:
".. it was agreed to allow Chinook to continue the game on a backup machine.
However, [...] we decided it would be in the best interests of sportsmanship
if we resigned." At that point of the match they were up 2-1.
They apparently also agreed to give Tinsley a couple of days to cure his
illness without <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>claiming<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> a win by forfeit which I assume they could have.

   Too bad the Chinook team doesn't have such sportsmanship.  IMO the match
should have been declared a draw with the champion retaining his title until
his health improved enough for a rematch.  Tinsley gave you guys every

possible break, and IMO you're just taking advantage of his overdeveloped
sense of fair play.  Guess that's just another area where machines are
superior, they don't suffer from that human weakness.

This is not the way we wanted the match to end.  While we wish the

   But you can console yourselves with your undeserved and meaningless title.

I guess you can claim your ignorance as extenuating circumstances.

If Tinsley is no longer able to compete, it is only natural that Chinook
is called the man-machine champion. They will prove whether they deserve the
title or not in a 20-game match against the 2nd best human player.
If Tinsley recovers (which we all hope) I'm sure there will be another
exciting match.
