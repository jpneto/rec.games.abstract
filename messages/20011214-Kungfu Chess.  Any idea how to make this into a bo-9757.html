This game is a contestant in the best Indie designer title.  Think of
it as chess meets the game Icehouse.  There are no turns and moves are
simultaneous.  While it is done on the computer, I am thinking that
perhaps there would be a way to do it as a boardgame.  Perhaps don't
allow players to move a piece twice in a row.  The dynamics of Kungfu
Chess allow for a player to move a piece that is about to be captured,
for example.

Anyhow, I would be interested in seeing if people had any ideas
regarding this.
