In a three-player game with the above asssumptions, there exist
winning connections that consist of only one node in addition to any
precoloured nodes.

As such games aren't very interesting, we can conclude that there
doesn't exist interesting three-player connection games that obey the
basic assumptions above.

You might consider games where each player colors exactly one node per
turn, and so you know that the final position will have exactly N/3
nodes in each color.  Then your argument wouldn't apply.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

How about if there are three colors, but each playing piece is colored in
two colors (checkerboard or sunburst). Each player's pieces are either half
of each type containing that player's color, or one third of all three types
including the type without that player's color.
