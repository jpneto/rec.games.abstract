I retreat to why I think you are trying to get away from a subject I

This in direct conflict with my explaination that
   "My question had nothing to do with the outcome being a
   draw.  I usually think of a "fighting game" as requiring
   attacks and defeats among pieces."

No offense, but why do you insist I meant one thing when it's clear that I
meant another?

Now don't be silly, you know I'm not trying to change meaning. I think
the answer to your question is a matter of linguistics, and easily
solved. "Attacks and defeats among pieces" are one type of battle game
that has a winner and loser and "ttt" is another type of battle game
that has a winner and loser.
 
I was just fascinated by the "draw," and used your tread to purse it,
whole heartily.

I think the "draw" and entropy are linked. I think, maybe, this life
that we are all currently experiencing is something like a draw game.
I think all life may only "pursues the draw game."
A little weird isn't it when a lot of people think all games must have
a winner and loser.
But after having no more losers, there might be no one left to play.
	
I am writing off the cuff again, so if this doesn't make sense, then
it probably doesn't : )
