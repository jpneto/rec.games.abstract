Thanks for clarifying, I think I understand now.

In my opinion a race element in a connection game is not necessarily a
bad thing, depending on how it is done.  Gonnect, for instance, is a
very good connection game with a race element.

I agree. I'd say that a race element is not a bad thing provided that there are enough blocking options, and there are plenty of them, both in Gonnect and Orcoon, thanks to the limited connectivity of the square board.

FWIW, I've now played Orcoon ten times against human players without any deadlock arising, but they may be more common between expert players. I've also played a few games against the Zillions machine, and the 3x3 deadlock pattern (and therefore a race) appeared once.
