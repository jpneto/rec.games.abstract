This seems like maybe an over-strong criterion by which to judge this
effort, if only because I can't imagine any circumstance under which
Go players would ever deem any game better than Go, even if you
created a game that was in some sense actually superior.  Experienced,
dedicated players are both emotionally wedded to their game and can
"see" into it more deeply than they can other games, so they'll always
think it best. The effect is really obvious among chess players since
a few profoundly good variants actually exist, but most chess players
would never admit that they rival FIDE chess for quality.

Not to mention Draughts players. 10x10 Draughts is under siege because
of its margin of draws (top-level match play being the main stumbling
block). In the mindsports homepage it says: "Draughts players are
hooked on opposition - they'll oppose anything" ;-) . Draughts players
tend to reject any change, and discuss little more than fumbling with
'additional rules' to fix the problem. Of the alternative games, only
Hexdame is taken somewhat more seriously, because it's a literal
translation of the square game. It's 'safe' to do so, because they
know it will always be peripheral anyway.

That should make an interesting contest :)
