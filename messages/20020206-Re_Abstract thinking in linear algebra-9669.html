The problem is that, unless a real "shock treatment" is used,
understanding cannot be taught in calculus.  Children are able

Could you explain this last sentence, please? It sure seems to be the case
that learning mathematics is easier for young children than for older
children,
but what does 'imitating computers' have to do with that?

I hope he will forgive me for putting words in his mouth.  In the US, we (well,
the societal we, certainly not me) spend an inordinate amount of time "teaching"
our children to compute by hand (add, subtract, multiply and divide).  At one
point in the 4th grade syllabus, the children need to answer 50 randomly chosen
multiplication problems (1 digit by 1 digit) in 5 minutes in order to move on to
the next phase of the syllabus (have to master learning objective n before you
can move on to totally unrelated objective n+1).  They are tested on their
ability to multiply 2 and 3 digit numbers by hand.

And probably the worst travesty is that this stuff is called "math" and not
"computation".

What is lost in all this is a sense of when to multiply.  What does it mean?
Why multiply?  Is the answer reasonable?  (They are graded on an all or nothing
scale.)  And this same emphasis on computing rather than understanding permeates
the whole mathematical curriculum.  Even in algebra, most students learn
formulas rather than learning to approach problems logically.

I have seen nothing in my children's or my student's mathematical education that
makes me feel the schools are doing anything other than giving them a list of
formulas, and leaving it entirely up to them to decide whether or not to learn
when to apply them and what the rationale and pitfalls might be.  The only
exceptions have, on further digging, turned out to be cases where the parents
have helped ("interfered with"?) the children's mathematical education, or the
students have done outside of class learning.  Maybe there are exceptions that I
don't know about, but they're pretty rare.

Those are my words (and ideas), but I think they echo Professor Rubin's.  His
succinctness seems to put off some readers, so I've expanded and made it more
personal.

The following are my ideas, and I have no idea whether Professor Rubin agrees.

People should think.  Computers should compute.  Using people to compute is a
waste of resources.

Additionally, I have run across an actuarial malpractice case and a couple of
accounting (UK and Can: accountancy) malpractice cases.  In each case, the
standard the professional is held to is not accuracy of answers but
reasonableness.  In other words, professionals are not required to be correct to
the penny (actually, depending on the circumstances, possibly not even required
to be correct at all), but they are required to verify that their approach is
reasonable and that it takes into account all the available data, and that there
is some effort put in to verify consistency and completeness of data.

In my experience, some people who are bad at math are <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>helped<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> by learning
how to program a computer. When they write programs that do purely formal
string manipulations, they come across bugs, and have to fix them, etc. Thus,
they definitely learn something about formal definitions. Especially about the
difference wteen their own (vague) intuitions and formal definitions. To a
large extent, they even become 'mathematical minds', after a while.

Yes.  And they even may compute, possibly even the same way the computer does.
But, they also think about why the algorithm works.  And we don't make them stay
at it until they can compete with the computer.

And I, for one, would be happier with more programmers who gave careful
consideration to what algorithm should be implemented and less to how can we
make this algorithm run faster.
