Another potential downside with the chicken version, as compared to
the landscape version, is that neutral stones may end up more bunched
together in the former, which leads to a less open-feeling, less
sweeping game.  That certainly appears to be the case for
inexperienced players, but the jury's out for experienced play.  I
imagine that there is some disincentive for bunching neutrals because
when you place a neutral close to the action, you often risk handing
the initiative to your opponent. Spreading out may be better but new
players are tempted to play close-in.
