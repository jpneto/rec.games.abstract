I'd like to chime in here. First off Nihius I am Corey Clark the
inventor of Slither. I'll say that Slither and Crossway are two very
different gameplay experiences. Slither has movement and almost cold
positions where you can lose tempo while Crossway is truer to its
predecessor, Hex. I doubt that Crossway is as thoroughly unplayable as
you say, especially when you take in to account the complete garbage
being designed today. I'd only played Crossway once as the second
player against a somewhat experienced player, Daniel Schultz and won,
so I think the game is playable at some level at least. This kind of
reminds me of Bill Taylor's recent "expose" on my other game Ki where
he described how you could make these 2x2 blocks that were
invulnerable to capture, what he failed to account for is that
creating this blocks is not an effective strategy because it doesn't
generate global influence over the board. Ki was playtested
extensively because it was almost unbelievable that it could play well
with no coldness and such simple rules but a few Go enthusiasts on
iggc demonstrated that it had quite a bit of depth for what it was. I
think Mark probably would've had the professional rigor to playtest
crossway and I don't think its fair to claim he didn't. The thing
about Crossway and Ki is you can't really blame designers for
releasing games like these even if they turned out to not be
tournament material because of their simplicity.

Perhaps you should try your hand at some Scrabble variations? There
your talents would really shine. As for your abstract games designs I
regret to say that the emperor's clothes are missing and there is
little hope for improvement.

Mark Steere invented Hex Oust, that alone is enough to commit him to
the abstract game design hall of fame. In all honesty, I'd have to
agree that there are a few unexceptional games in his resume but
that's to be expected in any designer who has a resume featuring so
many games. Mark has also made some very acclaimed abstracts like
Cephalopod. But here's something else, without Mark Steere's designs
and in particular Hex Oust I probably wouldn't have developed an
appreciation for finite and draw free games and the advent of Slither
may have never been! I don't think you can write off his whole resume,
featuring 20 some odd games because one of them didn't meet your
standards. And I highly recommend you play Hex Oust and try to tell me
that it's a bad game.

As I wrote Crossway has a feeling of Russian rulette because basic
tactics are excessively complicated. It is very easy to attack and
very hard to defend. For me this imbalance of perceived difficulty
indicates that a forcing winning tactics may be present shallow under
the surface of the rules (at least on 19x19 board). Examples which I
presented show that even with perfect defence it takes a lot of space
and many precise movements to stop the advance.  A beginner winning
with an experienced player (as happened to you) fits well into this.
Such things just do not happen in games like Chess or Go etc. As Mr.
Steere freely admitted (and more than once) he is unable to play any
games on a level higher than basic so his game productions are
necessarily more or less random untested collections of rules. As the
abstract games have a nice feature that they have a life of their own
it is of course fully possible that a game or two in this flood of
random mediocrity may be playable including Oust. Hey, it may even be
a very good game. This also means that in general people will be
wasting their time looking for things that cannot be found in the
majority of Mr. Steere's productions. This is why I wrote this post.
To share my testing of the game with the others. If you claim that the
games of Mr. Steere inspired you to create Slither then I would say
that this is the best that followed from his activity.

Writing about Scrabble I refered to this famous and and well-tested
game:

Fuckkle (The original F... You game). By Mark. S. Work in progress.
Here are the condensed rules:
1) The game is played between Mark S. and other players of his
choosing on various internet fora.
2) Mark S. starts by saying F... You.
3) Players may pass their turn. Two consecutive passes DO NOT end the
game.
4) Mark S. wins. Always.
5) Draws cannot happen in Fuckkle.
6) Players should not urinate on Mark. S and his greatness.
7) Mark. S is the TZAR of urinating and can urinate left, right and
center.
8) If you do not like rule number 6) you can piss off.
9) Fuckkle is among the very best games of Mark. S. Nay, not his very
best.  <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>The<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> very best.
10) Goto 4)
11) Highly intelligent players play Mark. S' games.

Puzzle: what is wrong with rule number 11)?
A hint for Mr. Steere: unreachable code.
