<br>Googling (Polgar chess variant) produces some more viable-looking

<br>the first hit explains some variants suggested by their father).

<br><blockquote type=cite>Football, the game itself, is
<br>FAR more complicated than chess.&nbsp; It is compared to chess, because
<br>chess is a simplistic analogy to have people relate to it.&nbsp; It has
<br>multiple ways you can score in it, a bunch of rules governing how the
<br>pieces on the board can move, more than chess.&nbsp; It also has multiple
<br>phases, unlike chess.&nbsp; Yes, football is on TV.&nbsp; It is because the NFL
<br>made it TV friendly back then.&nbsp; Had it not done that, it wouldn't be
<br>where it is today.&nbsp; It would be even less than hockey is.&nbsp; I believe
<br>that it wouldn't even be necessary to change the basic time controls
<br>either.&nbsp; Sure, change the scoring a bit, so you get closure, but for
<br>TV, you can do time compression.
<br></blockquote>
<br>Speaking as an amateur follower of both games, football is easier to
<br>partially understand, because more aspects of it follow simple linear
<br>scales that routinely vary widely:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;1) Which team is behind on points?&nbsp; By how many?&nbsp; How much time do
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they have left to try to catch up?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;2) Which team has possession, i.e. is in a short-term position to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; score more points?&nbsp; How close are they to a scoring position,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e. where is the line of scrimmage, what down is it, and how
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far must they advance the ball to reset to first down?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;3) What are each team's specific strengths and weaknesses?&nbsp; What
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strategies do these dictate?&nbsp; (This is where it gets complex.)
<br>
<br>The closest obvious analogy in chess is "which player is behind on
<br>captured pieces?".&nbsp; Beyond that, what would a similar breakdown of
<br>positional analysis look like?
<br></blockquote>
<br>It seems to me there's a relevant and obvious difference between chess 
and football.&nbsp; When I watch a football game, I can think "I could have 
done that myself, if I were fitter".&nbsp; Ok, it's not true, I couldn't 
really have done it, but I can understand what the guy did, and I can 
imagine my doing it.&nbsp; But in chess, I don't find myself thinking "I 
could have done that myself, if I were cleverer".
