According to my records, the magazines were mailed to Mats in
February. Also, we had responded to a previous query from Mats asking
him to contact us if nothing was received by the end of March. I'm
willing to address this now. I don't know why his recent email was
returned.

There have been delays recently due mainly to overwhelming work
committments. But Issue 17 is in preparation and will be better than
ever.

I know it is frustrating to wait for stuff. Sometimes it's our fault,
but sometimes it's out of our control. My apologies to anyone else who
has experienced problems recently, whatever the reason.

Many thanks to all in the past who have supported Abstract Games
magazine.

Kerry

No, I got a response from there around 2 weeks ago. Website was updated
recently too.

I also had the problem you mentioned once.

I used another account and my mail got through. I've had no answer
despite a couple of reminders. The back issues and the subscription I
ordered has been pay for months ago.
