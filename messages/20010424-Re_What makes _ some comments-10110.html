Hello,


</pre><blockquote type=cite><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Actually, what impressed me most about the article was the mention of "Nine
Men's Morris enthusiasts" and "the current world champion."  This tells me
that people still do play the game seriously--which means that even after
developing a good deal of skill at the game, they still consider it
interesting.  The world champion, I'm guessing, has not personally "solved"
the game.  He doesn't go into a match expecting that he and his opponent
will make the best moves every time (and that therefore every game will be a
draw).  Rather, he presumes that he and his opponent will likely both make
mistakes--and the player who makes the fewest mistakes will win, unless his
opponent can force a draw.

Sure, this must be true.

I don't really know anything about the community of Morelles players,
or what sort of lengths the top players go to, to win their games.
I have heard several people complain about Gasser's results, since he
didn't use the exact "official" ruleset. So, it could be argued that
NMM hasn't been solved yet.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

At least Morris as played according to the official rules is not solved.
But Gasser states that the official rules differ not much from the rules he
used, so probably official Morris should be a draw as well.

I know strong Renju players spend a lot of time studying opening
theory, looking for new traps and surprises for their opponents.
The same is true in chess, of course. If a similar database were
made available in those games, you can bet the players would be
scrambling to access it.

Victor Allis claims in his dissertation

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/victor/gomoku.ps.Z">ftp://ftp.cs.vu.nl/pub/victor/gomoku.ps.Z</a>

that he has solved the game of Gomoku (i.e. "free play Renju). He writes
that Goro Sakata and Wataru Ikawa have stated that Black has an "assured"
win, but didn't "proof" it or "substantiated" it by a "tree (of variations)".

I have now the book of Sakata and Ikawa just about 10 inchs in front of me
and do you know what I see?

1rst: These authors literally claim a "sure" win for Black.
2nd: They substantiate their claim on 32 pages containing 116 diagrams.
3rd: These diagrams show a tree of variations.

BTW it can be assumed, as this is a book for beginners, that Japanese
Renju literature about Renju Josekis give even more details proofing that
Gomoku is a win for Black.

A brute-force 18-ply search is, almost certainly, beyond human
capacity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

No, it isn't. There are lots of examples (life and death problems in Go,
mating problems in chess variants, combinations in draughts variants)
which show that top players analyze well beyond 18-plies in actual
tournament play in some board situations.



</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
Also, I'm not so sure that the whole thing COULDN'T be memorized.
Some people have astonishing memory capacity.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Indeed!

So, I can see a "trivial" game like tic-tac-toe being dead.  Once you
realize you can't lose unless you blunder, and you see how easy it is to
avoid blundering, your interest in the game is going to fall off completely.

But a non-trivial game like NMM can continue to be interesting when humans
play each other (without the assistance of computers).  Or when a computer
AI can be dumbed down enough to make the occasional blunder.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Of course, it depends on the individual. Many people play and enjoy
Connexxions a.k.a. Gale a.k.a. Bridgit, even though a simple winning
strategy has been found. Their (presumed) ignorance doesn't stop them
from finding the game interesting.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Your view is very balanced! Congratulations!

What would you think if Twixt were solved?  Would it make any difference to
you if some computer program proved that you can't lose if you don't
blunder?
</pre></blockquote></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I would say: NO! Computers are able to do lots of things better than I
do (for instance, they have a larger memory), but I still enjoy using my
brain.
