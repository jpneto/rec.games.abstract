On the chess front, a simplified chess game would help out some, count

As it happens, during my web researches on Chivalry and associated
games, I found, to my surprise, that - not counting All the King's Men/
Smess - Parker Brothers actually once published a game, Citadel, that
could be considered to be a form of simplified Chess.

I describe it on my web page at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.quadibloc.com/other/bo0104.htm">http://www.quadibloc.com/other/bo0104.htm</a>

at the bottom (the web page is about Chivalry and Camelot, but also
includes diagrams of the boards for Chinese Checkers and Halma).

The main point of my post was to express a conclusion I'd reached from
considering the various things done with Checkers - including the
eleven-man ballot - that by looking at the <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>nature<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> of the things done
to resolve the (inescapable!) problems with Checkers, we can see why
changes to Chess are resisted, and why a change to a different game,
by means of a Chess variant, is the most difficult of changes to get
accepted.

If Chess can be revitalized <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>without<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> invalidating what the experts in
Chess have already learned, because the change is a very slight one,
that would be a direction more likely to be accepted.
