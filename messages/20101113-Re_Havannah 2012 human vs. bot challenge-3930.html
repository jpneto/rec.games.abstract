The most interesting thing about all this is not necessarily whether
you will win or lose in 2012, Christian (Yes, I think you have a
chance, but given that the bar is set at 10 out of 10 I would tend to
favor the bots), but how much programming effort has gone into
Havannah.  I'm sure the challenge prize accounts for some of it, but
not all of it.  Other modern games I can think of that have attracted
significant efforts from programmers include Arimaa, Lines of Action,
Amazons.  I believe there is also a challenge prize for Arimaa.

Yes, much bigger too :)
But the point of the likes of Timo and Richard competing, and others
of which I will also mention Ingo Althofer

and Johannes Waldmann

who was involved in Deep Fork's development, is not the prize money.
It's about what Timo summarizes.

Arimaa employs an exploding branch density to fight of the bots. Very
effective, but not too difficult to achieve, even under the condition
that a game must be 'playable' for humans. Medusa is a good example:

Havannah's challenge is that it is a simple pencil &amp; paper game, yet
(still) largely eludes attempts to program it to the level of the
better human players.
