AYU (As Yet Unnamed)
=================

AYU is a misère combinatorial game with the look of a connection game.

Definitions
---------------

In this rules, "adjacent" always means "orthogonally adjacent".

A unit is a singleton or group. A singleton is a piece
with no adjacencies to like-colored pieces. A group is a
set of like-colored, adjacent pieces.

Play
-------

The game is played on he intersections (points) of an odd-sized square
board. 11x11 is suggested as the standard size. At the start of the
game, Black and White pieces are arranged in the following pattern:

. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .
o . o . o . o . o . o
. x . x . x . x . x .

Black plays first, then turns alternate. On each turn, players must do
one of the following actions:

a) Move a friendly singleton to an adjacent empty point.
b) Take a piece from a friendly group and place it on a different
empty point adjacent to the same group, without splitting it at any
moment.

Every move must reduce the distance between the moved unit and the
closest friendly unit. The distance between two units is the shortest
path of adjacent empty points between them, i.e. the number of
consecutive moves one would need to join them.

If a player can't make a move on his turn, he <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>wins<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>. This usually
occurs when said player has joined all his pieces in a single group.
Draws and cycles are not possible.

_______________________________

As in many games, controlling the center is quite important. From
there, it's easier to cut enemy units off, thus forcing the opponent
to spend much more turns connecting them. However, you must be careful
not to lock up all his units completely at the same time, or you'll
deprive him of available moves.

My first impression was a kind of Cage without capture, but
fortunately your condition for moving singles is less brutal. The
absence of capture is more or less my worry. The tactical scope would
appear modest, so it all boils down to strategy. In fact the game is
related to somewhat to Pylyx (where I have similar worries). How deep
will a player's grip on strategy be, once tactics have been more or
less sorted out.
What I like about it is its simplicity (simplicity keeps turning up -
there seems to be an endless amount of it ;-) and the fact that it
obviously works as intended, and may be strategically interesting.
Whether its captivating is another question (and subjective at that).

A word of warning: AYU is a sweet fish with a one-year life span ;-)
