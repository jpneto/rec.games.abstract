If it were up to me, yes.  But the guy you were talking to is the boss here.  We call him Hazen.

I wish I had time to investigate your game, but law school demands all my time. Sounds interesting though, just skimming through it.  Don't worry if it's exactly the sort usually discussed.  We've got bandwidth to spare.

I`m not the boss! 
I will never be a boss! 
The group belongs to no one.
Did Yoshi answer to your request?
If not there is another guy.
You have to post your game here :

Do not ask anyone particularly but there is Fatal_Error (moderator nickname) who programmed 2 of my games. If the game Hex Oust interest him for sure he will post the code.

Good luck to you.
I have 3 brothers with high level in programming (more than 300.000 dollars year as salary) but they are very very very busy. They are not in Toronto (one in Europe and the 2 others in other cities in Canada : Edmonton and Vancouver).
