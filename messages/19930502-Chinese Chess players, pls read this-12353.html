Hi, I am finalizing my Chinese Chess program for Mac
and I would like to discuss some questions with
all who are interested in Chinese Chess.

1. What notation should be used? I remember there are
two kind of notations. I want to find out
the prefered one and its standard.

2. The main reason for 1. is this: I want my program
be a tool for people who want to comment on games and
post it ( or communicate with people.) or record 
comments from newspaper, books on some good games. There will be a
window for entering comments along the Chess plate. You enter your comments
for each move. You can move the games back and forth step by step.
After you are done, and can save the move record and the comments along
the moves into a text file. Then you can post the content of the file to
say 
this newsgraoup for discussion. And you can read the file back( or you
download 
other people's postings into a file) into the program. Now you can go
through
the game move by move on screen and also read the comments at the side
window.

To be able to visualize the game while reading comments
is much better than looking at the notations.

3. Doing 2. above just between my programs would be easy. But I would 
like to see a standard established so that people can exchange
a game with comments even they are using different programs or
just use a texteditor to enter the stuff.

One benifit of transmitting the game is you can save it to your openning
book easily. And you can print it out graphically.

4. What kind of look of the chess pieces you like other than
the Chinese Character. There is figures. Also there is the one that used
in the book 'Chinese Chess for Beginner' ( I am not sure if I remember 
the name correct.), basically it uses the first English letter for
the piece. This question is for westerner who may prefer not using
the Chinese characters.

I would also like to see people discuss what  features they would
like to see in a Chinse Chess program to make playing, recording,
communicating, teaching and learning the game easier. I hope developers
can be benifited from this discusion so that they can help
improve the skill level of Chinese Chess . 

Not everyone is using Chess program right now.But from my experience with
my program, I believe the future Chess books will be  eletronic ones and
will come with a Chess program ( or some kind of displayers). It is
just a lot better than  reading notations.
