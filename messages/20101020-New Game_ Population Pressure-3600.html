Two tribes are competing for territory by breeding.  Couples make
babies.  My most thematic game :)

Population Pressure is a game for 2 players, played on a hexhex
board.  I recommend Hexhex5 to start.

Rules:

1. The board begins empty.

2. To begin, one player places one white and one black stone on any
vacant spaces on the board, and the other player decides whether to
play as White or Black.

3. Starting with Black, the players take turns.  You may place one
stone  on any vacant space on each turn, until you have a group on the
board of size 2 or larger.  After that, on your turn you may place as
many stones on vacant spaces as you have groups of size 2 or larger on
the board.

4. The game ends when the board is full, and the player with the
largest group wins.   If the players largest groups are the same
size, the player with the fewest stones on the board wins.

On larger boards, you might experiment with higher minimum group sizes
(Polyamory?)
