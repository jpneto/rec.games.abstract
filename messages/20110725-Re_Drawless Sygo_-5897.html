Passing first is called "taking the button", and it's worth an extra
half-point in the score. (In principle, taking the button also lifts
ko bans, but this is irrelevant here.)

Interestingly, this isn't suggested as a way to eliminate draws (komi
already does), but as a way to make the game sharper. I quote: "The
point about the sharpness of button go is that, characteristically,
there are fewer correct plays among the options available than there
are without the button."

This is also applicable to Sygo. With the so-called "button", close
endgames become tenser and more textured, as there are fewer
equivalent plays.

I'm not unfamiliar with the reasoning because Medusa and Lotus
actually apply it. In Medusa you have to keep track because the point
(not a half) is awarded for refraining from placement. You can still
move if you don't place. And it works just as intended: you get more
efficient.

It doesn't change that you can 'overprotect' in Sygo however, because
as long as passing is not an option (i.e. you must react at at least
one place anyhow), you might as well use more if not all available
growing options, including those that under closer examination may be
found to be superfluous. In Medusa it's different of course because it
has 'multi movement' but no 'multi growth'.

That's not to say that it isn't applicable in Sygo. Let's say I keep
it as a hanging matter. For the moment I'm satisfied to see how Sygo
behaves in actual play.
