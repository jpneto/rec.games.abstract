Ketchup is essentially a draw susceptible game though, if both players end
up with the same largest group size.  Adding a horse shit rule (no offense,
Nick) of then comparing the next largest groups, and the next next largest
groups, etc. hammers a square peg into a round hole and it's an aesthetic
disaster IMO.

So is the embedded balancing mechanism of Sygo, IYO. It only shows
that your incapable of recognizing a good thing because you don't even
recognize it.

What Ketchup seems to have in common with Sygo is that it's only as good as
its latest tweak.

Interesting, which tweak would that be in Sygo? It must have happened
while I wasn't around.

For example, there are a number of parameters in the
following paragraph that could get tweaked, once players become a little
more expert.

"When a group of at least size 2 has formed, the nature of the turns change.
From then on, on your turn, if your largest group is smaller
than your opponent's largest group, you must drop 3 stones. Otherwise you
must drop 2 stones."

No Mark, that's another good balancing mechanism you fail to see. Bad
intuition and sloppy thinking (if at all - you know everything, why
think?).

I might add that Ketchup's balancing mechanism, like Sygo's, isn't
game specific and will likely have wider applications which you will
also fail to recognize.
Because you're Mark Steere.
