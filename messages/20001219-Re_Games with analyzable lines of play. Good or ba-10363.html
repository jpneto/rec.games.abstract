I dislike Bridge even more due the bidding conventions (which

I strongly disagree with you here. Communications in a lossy channel
is for me <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>the<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> key distinguishing element of Bridge. Bidding
conventions are designed to make the most of the limited bandwidth
available in the game vocabulary (pairs taken from a 12 symbol
alphabet + 3 singleton symbols). The key thing is that the Bridge
rules <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>don't<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> establish bidding conventions. Evidence for this can be
seen in the multiplicity of different conventions used in club and
tournament play.

Only small-minded players enforce their conventions rigidly. Better
players know that conventions establish a semantic framework which is
itself subject to manipulation in order to achieve strategic
goals. (FWIW, I'm a professional computer geek who specializes in
network protocols so my view may be slightly unorthodox - plus I'm a
notoriously successful 'psychic' bidder).
