The problem for checkers was "solved" early in the 18th century, when
some clever Dutchman realised the game plays better on 10x10, with
long king and some other small changes compared to English Checkers.
This is the version of the game that is most popular in the world
today, but it does not appear to be very well-known in the English-
speaking world.

indeed notes that Polish Checkers, or Continental Checkers is
considered the international form of the game, and has so far not had
a need for the measures applied to English Draughts.

Why Americans and Australians and Englismen are willing to go to such
lengths rather than simply join the rest of the world may well be
perplexing to some, but I was not concerning myself with this point.
Certainly, switching to another game is another option - in the case
of Chess, that could be Capablanca Chess, or it could be Tsiu Shogi -
but the measures applied to the standard English game of Checkers are
still an interesting case history.
