I like Yote because it combines entering with elimination, just like
Emergo and Oust.

This sounds like an interesting way to reach those cut off pieces that you'd
never reach otherwise, and to prevent a follow-up, counter-jump to your
jump.  It also sounds like a big advantage to the first player who gets to
do it.  While the game undoubtedly has a fabulous gameplay, I tend to
analyze games from a perspective of aesthetics and robustness, and not so
much the gameplay.  And it's usually not good news, so I apologize in
advance for that, but nothing personal is meant by it.

Second rule set:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yot�">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yot�</a>
In a move, a
player may either:
- Place a piece in an empty space on the board.
- Move one of their pieces already on the board to an adjacent
orthogonal space.

I like this rule better.  I love phases in games, but only if they arise
naturally, not if they're forced by the rules.  Like first you fill up the
board, or add so many pieces to the board, and then the rules are different.
 This is an aesthetic problem for me.  Again, no offense to designers who
have games like that.  Not even a big deal really.  Just a fine point.

- Capture an opposing piece by jumping orthogonally to the space

The game can end in a draw if both players have three or fewer pieces.

Of course Cage springs to mind as similar to Yote, except finite.  In both
games you have orthogonal jumping in any direction, but in Yote there's
nothing to prevent a draw.  Draws may be exceedingly rare in Yote for all I
know (but I don't know).
