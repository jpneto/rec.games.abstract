There are an awful lot of rows.  Let's see,  there are 500 "straight"
wins,  I think 300 "diag-1's",  4 * 5 * 4 "diag-2's" and 8 "diag-3s"
(diag-1 means keeping 2 dimensions constant,  diag-2 keesp
1 constant,  and diag3 0).

But with symmetry, there are MUCH fewer than this.

What does that have to do with anything?

In three dimensions,
there are only 8:
A) Three along an exterior side,
B) Three in the interior
C) Two diagonal ones.

These are the same 8 rows in 3dTTT, but your opponent has less opportunity
to block you, as you only need 3 in a row to win. Here, you have to have 5
in a row.

In 3d TTT you need 4 in a row to win.  With 3 in a row it's a trivial
forced win.

I think to prove my supposition, we need to determine which function grows
faster: the number of distinct rows provided by increasing the dimension, or
the number of moves required to win by increasing the size of the grid. If
the number of moves required grows faster, then there are fewer ways to win.
Just like when you play 2dTTT on a 5x5 grid; you can barely ever win.

Maybe you mean the chance of a win (as opposed to a draw) is less?
Obviously if you play 2d TTT on a 5X5 grid with 5 required to
win there are more ways to win than on a 3X3.
