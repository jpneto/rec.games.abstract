No crack, no discount ($5000).  The thin streaks are iron ore or something.  The fabricator said the streaks were the hardest material he ever cut through in twenty years.  It's also electrically conductive.  Sometimes you touch the countertop and your iphone a few feet away turns on by itself.

The chicklet tiles are very interesting.  They're about 3/4 the size of a sugar cube, filled with crushed, burnt ember glass, and glazed over.  The labor on that went on for weeks.  Initially they went up on sheets but I didn't like the look, so I had them removed and reinstalled one by one with little plastic spacers.

I thought that too, but it turns out, at least in my case, when you're looking at a monitor, that's all you see.  Whatever's going on behind it isn't an issue.

I was looking forward to posting a youtube video to document "year one", but year one came around last month and I was nowhere near ready.  Now looking forward to year two, at the earliest.  I can play just about anything by ear, if it's not too complicated, but that only gets you so far.  Now I'm learning to read, learning the key signatures, music theory, etc. etc. etc.  It's kind of a drag but it's necessary for advancement.
