Hi Carl,

Thanks for taking the time to help clear this up. Epecially, your
reference to the newsgroup guidelines.

In regards to the basic question of whether Chebache is an abstract
game or not. It seems to me that the term "abstract game" is not 
defined by whether it includes chance or not. There are simply 
abstract games with chance and those without. The newsgroup 
guideline that you reference...

"...discussion of abstract games where strategy, tactics and player 
skill are paramount."

... seems to basically say this as well by clarifying which group 
of abstract games that it is focusing on. Meaning that there is more 
than one category of abstract games. Chebache would clearly be
placed in a category including abstract games that include chance.
At least in regards to your reference. Do you agree?
 
You may feel that any game that includes chance is not worth your 
time and I respect that train of thought. I also love games of 
pure strategy, but, also enjoy playing strategy games that include 
an element of chance, because I feel that they are more reprentative 
of real life experience and can help one learn to prepare for the 
unknown variables, accidents or "freak" occurances in life and
may help people keep an open mind to things that they don't 
understand fully right off. Additionally, I think it can make 
for a more enjoyable game for a novice and beginner to play together, 
since it gives the beginner at least a sense of having a "chance" 
to win.

One of the thoughts that inspired me to design Chebache came from 
a general feeling that Backgammon was a bit to chance oriented for 
me and that most matches were essentially over half way through. 
This is partly due to the lack of defensive options. Once the 
player's pieces have passed each other along the path, it became 
simply a race off the board with no opportunity for interaction. 
So, without the inclusion of a doubling cube and the wagering process,
the game lacked interest and excitement from mid game on...at least 
for me. I also felt there were to many safes involved in that simply 
having 2 pieces together eliminated any risk to those pieces and their
positioning. In Chebache, there is rarely, if ever a situation or
position that cannot be threatened in some way. This makes it more 
challenging to way the benefits of stacking up for strength and 
holding a position or spreading out for more options and more fluid 
movement.

I've demonstrated how to play Chebache to hundreds, even thousands 
of people from age 5 and up and I assure you that most people have 
a pretty good understanding how to play after one game and that I 
can explain how to play in less than 5 minutes. Children seem to 
generally learn much faster, which I find fascinating. I think it's 
most likely due, at least in part, to them having a more open mind 
and stronger desire to try something new. Learning the strategies 
and how to blend them and keep them flexible are things that each 
player will develop at different rates and in different ways as in 
any strategy game. I firmly believe that it is an easier "in" than 
Chess and I think most would agree. This is assuming you are learning 
Chess for the first time. This is even more true if you were to learn 
Chess from a Rulebook. I think it is simply a matter of familiarizing 
yourself with the basic concepts of Chebache before trying to teach
it.

On another note, I do apologize for my "hyped up topic" in my post
and can understand your thoughts on this. I'm simply excited to 
finally have Chebache up and running Online and wanted to share it 
with others that enjoy trying new games...especially when it's a free 
offering. Thanks for mentioning that. I'll try to keep your thoughts 
in mind in the future. I wasn't thinking about the counter point to 
my use of CAPS, etc.

All the best,
Regards,
Scott Pardee

I think that most people in this group agrees that an abstract game should
be without an element of chance. I personally think that the discussion fits
better in rec.games.board.

The game board may look nice, but to me, as an abstract games enthusiast,
this game is nothing special. I'd rather play a game of Backgammon than
teach someone these complicated rules, if someone insisted to play a game
with chance in.

Also, I am unimpressed by your hyped up topic, which makes the post looks
more like the regular spams that go to the groups than a regular post.

The following old RFD for the group rec.games.abstract summarizes this
nicely. It can be found at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=rec.games.abstract+news.groups+hex&amp;hl=sv&amp;l">http://groups.google.com/groups?q=rec.games.abstract+news.groups+hex&amp;hl=sv&amp;l</a>
r=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d&amp;selm=BtMLqM.4qy%40uunet.uu.net&amp;rnum=4 but I'll include
a quote:

"The newsgroup would be for discussion of abstract games where strategy,
tactics and player skill are paramount.  This includes the major category of
perfect information, pure-strategy (deterministic) games, i.e. those with no
element of chance (e.g. no dice), and where all information is available
(unlike card games and Scrabble, for example, where players' hands are
hidden).  The games under consideration are characterised by a simple board
and pieces, with a small number of rules.  The cliche `a minute to learn, a
lifetime to master' is often applied.  A list of example games is given at
the end of this RFD."

I think that althought the above uses the word 'includes', it is quite clear
that the group was intended for games of no chance during gameplay.

regards,
Carl Johan

Hi Ralf,

Your message was rather blunt, without an explanation.
How Chebache is categorized does not mean a whole lot to me.
I just hope that people find it fun, exciting, challenging,
etc...and even learn something new while playing.  However,
Chebache has been repeatedly categorized by publications that
have reviewed it, as an abstract strategy game. Such as
Games Magazine, Abstract Games Magazine, and an upcoming
article on abstract games in Counter Magazine(UK), to name
a few of clear relevance.  Therefore, I felt that it was safe
to assume that it is. As far as I'm aware of what categorizes
a game as "abstract", Chebache fits in quite well.

You clearly have a different opinion of what defines an abstract
game, but, offer no reason for your stance on the matter. This
implies that you feel this should be perfectly clear to all that
might read your reply. Well, I for one, don't claim to be an
expert on the matter, but, would like to know why you feel so
strongly about this.

So, if you would be so kind as to offer a clear definition of
what an abstract game is and why Chebache does not fit in, it
should help me understand your stern response to my message
heading. It would also be helpful, if you could give some
reason or reference as to why your definition should be
accepted as fact, not opinion. Where should one draw the line?

I would also be interested in other's thoughts on this issue.

Just curious.
Regards,
Scott Pardee

Subject: CHEBACHE: New Abstract...Now Online!(FREE)

Hello Everyone,

Chebache is a new abstract strategy board game which is now
available as an Online version with a FREE download at:
                     <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.chebache.com">www.chebache.com</a>

Chebache unites elements of Checkers, Backgammon and Chess and many
unique modes of play. It was designed to fill the gap between
Backgammon and Chess in regards to the balance of strategy and chance.
There are more options of movement and strategy than Backgammon, while
still including the chance elements of dice.
(Please read the excerpts from some of the reviews and comments about
Chebache at the end of this message.)

The Online version of Chebache, which is up and running as a trial
version is a FREE download, which will have occasional updates.
The latest version is 2.3.

*Note: Chebache Online will only run on PC (Windows) computers, for
now. Sorry to all Mac users, we hope to have a Mac version ready
sometime soon.

There are several tutorial aspects
included, which are explained in the "Help" section of the MENU, along
with the rules, notation and other features. Once online, please check
the message board for updates.

For the FREE download and general information about Chebache,
including reviews from On and Offline magazines and comments from
Chebache players, please take a moment to visit:

                      <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.chebache.com">www.chebache.com</a>

* The links for the download and the Chebache Egroups forum are in the
left margin of the home page, although we may move the link to a more
visible location soon.


We are hosting Chebache Online Gatherings Monday and Tuesday nights
from 7-10pm EST, however, there is clearly a need to find another time
that would be more convenient for those of you across the ocean. If
you have a feeling about a given time that would work well for you,
please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate. You may
play online at anytime, as long as you can find someone there to play.
So, for the time being, you will find it easier if you arrange to meet
someone in the "game room" at particular time. One way to do this
would be to join Chebache egroups on yahoo.com where you can leave
messages about when you are available to play.

We would greatly appreciate your help in fine tuning Chebache Online.
We believe that we have successfully fixed all the bugs, but, have
not tested the server with a large number of people playing at once.
If you should have any problems or would simply like to comment or
ask a question about Chebache,  please don't hesitate to write us.

"It has an elegent, extremely well conceived structure, providing the
players with accessible but complex decisions.  Most important, It's
teriffic fun, even exciting to play.  ...Chebache's magic lies in the
ever changing game flow. ...It's this combination of fast movement,
die rolling, and deep positional play that makes Chebache so
entertaining. If you are looking for an exciting game built on
familiar principles that has addictive quality and will also stretch
your strategic faculties, ...I strongly recommend Chebache.
I love this elegent game and I think you will too."
      --Mitchell Thomashow, TheGamesJournal.com

amazed at how much originality, choice and action there is this tiny
arena."
      --John J. McCallion, GAMES Magazine

"Tactics are far more interesting than backgammon varied [than
backgammon], and there are more interesting long term strategies.
Recommended"
      -- Frank Branham, Gamer's Alliance

"I found the appearance of Chebache to be immediately appealing...
The effort is well woth the reward. This is an attractive and
interesting game."   --Kerry Handscomb, Abstract Games Magazine

"...If you enjoy chess or backgammon, then you should get plenty of
game play out of Chebache, and it would be well worth adding to your
game collection. ...Highly Recommended (and then some).
         --Todd Weaver, KODT Magazine (Knights of the Dinner Table)

"If you really like Backgammon, graduate to Chebache. Whenever a
game designer combines several ideas from several games, I often
find myself wishing that I was playing Chebache.  "Now, whenever
I play Backgammon, I find myself wishing I was playing Chebache."
        --Jake Davenport, ContageousDreams.com

GENERAL PUBLIC

  "Just had to send you an email. I got my copy of Chebache yesterday
and have yet only played one game. And that game has me hooked!"
Very well done. I'm extremely impressed.  You've achieved a beautiful
balance between many different elements, opening up all sorts of
strategic plans. Yet at the same time created a game that is simple
to play an simple to learn. Heck, I even really like the way it looks.
It's very visually appealing.  ...I'm going to highly recommend this
game to everyone!   Thanks!"     --Evan Siegworth 11/18/2000

  "You have a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>winner<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> here... Familiarity makes me appreciate its
subtlety.  Chebache, I believe is truly a metaphor for life. Many
lessons to be lessons   to be learned there."  --Thomas A. Gilchrist

  Chebache is great! I learned at Gen-Con and have sucked my sister
and parents in to this great game. Thanks!  --Karl Schultz  9/17/2000

  I bought Chebache for my wife for Christmas, and it made a great
gift!  We both enjoyed playing it. Thanks for the fun new game.
           --Craig Dailey 12/29/2000

  "We could tell right away that Chebache was [going to be] Great!
...The more we play,  the better we grasp the implications of the
various options, and we're enjoying the process of learning how to
better incorporate them into strategic play.  ...One of the things
I really like is that the entire board remains in play throughout
the game. There's never a "table" or point that's out of contention.
...Chebache is truly a game of "It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over," and we
love the adrenaline rush on both sides when one of us suddenly
capitalizes on the dice/formations and redirects the flow of the game.
This game is <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>fun<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>!
 - My 11 - yr old son played Chebache for the first time a couple of
nights ago. Having watched his father and me go at it, he jumped right
in- ...As it  was, he beat me fairly handily.
He's decided he really likes Chebache :-).
         --Sarah Samuelson   5/22/2001

"Just checking in with some Chebache thoughts, as the game remains
one of my husband's and my favorite head-to-head contests. ...Our
family recently joined another for a week end away, providing the
opportunity for my husband and me to play a best-of-three mini
tournament with one another - three consecutive games within the
span of a week end (somewhat of a luxury for us).  ...After our
recent playings, I appreciate the Rush Factor all the more.
...- that adrenaline surge resulting from suddenly being back in
a game, from the instant momentum swings possible from mid-game on.
It was also interesting introducing Chebache to our friends.
Perhaps our zeal and obvious enjoyment piqued their interest? :-)"
