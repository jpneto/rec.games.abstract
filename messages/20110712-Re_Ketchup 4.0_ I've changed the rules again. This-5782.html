I also like the new version best. Nick, do you think this one can be

I imagine that it will still be best on small boards, but large boards
won't be as much of a detriment as for earlier versions.  I haven't
played it on anything larger than hexhex5, so my opinion may not mean
much at this point.

I feel it will eventually outgrow hexhex5, though I'm not sure where
it will end. It's not a 'slow' game, so if strategical and tactical
implications fit (or indeed need) a wider area, there's some room to
provide for that without getting 'lengthy'.

What about a randomly generated board?  hexhex5 is 61 hexagons, so you
can have the mean value of the board be about 61 hexes.

you can see what might happen at my xong game site, just click on the
<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Reset<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> button to generate random board after random board....

which aint workin' for me cause my java is out of date i guess or
something like that, but my brother tells me it is working.


a randomly generated board eliminates memorized openings, "cooks", if
you will, but - because both players still have all of the information
at hand at the start - it still is an Abstract Game.
