Splyt sounds nice too, but the object is as much to Joyn ;-)

At first, I considered having the opposite goal and was happy to name
it Splyt, but found that joining is more intuitive than splitting, and
that's what connection games are about in the first place. Of course,
with the right to place stones of both colors, the game is still
effectively the same.

I have some trouble visualizing how one could plan ahead. Of course
this becomes increasingly possible towards the endgame, but how to get
to a 'favorable' middlegame or how to plan in the opening, those are
aspects that elude me at the moment. I also feel a shadow of a "nim-
like" algorithm, but that may not be the case at all. Of course not
having to count (if players are paying attention) is a great plus.
My first impression is a tactical game in the 'fairly obscure
strategy' category (of which Othello is a known representative).

I'd rather put it in the same category as Omega, a very strategical
game in my opinion. Unlike Omega, Yodd is a pure connection game (i.e.
without a territorial component), because group sizes don't matter,
but otherwise they should share a fair amount of strategy space. And
of course, unlike Omega, you don't need to perform multiplications
(!?) in Yodd.

I can't see how a nim-like algorithm could be applied here, but maybe
I'm missing something.

Yodd is a 'dynamic goals' connection game, as opposed to 'static
goals' games, as Hex, Y or one of my favorites, Global Connection.
Throughout the game, players can create new groups for the opponent,
which immediately become new connection goals for him. That should be
a plus. On how to plan in the opening, you should try to create enemy
groups in the edges of the board, so that they are likely to remain
unconnected, and find a place in the center for your own groups.
That's how Omega is played, too.
