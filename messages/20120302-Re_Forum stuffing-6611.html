Graham, I like you and I appreciate the effort you've put into Redstone thus far.  But don't show up at rec.games.abstract and play New Sheriff in Town.  New sheriffs don't last long here.  That's why they're new.

It's not entirely clear what your point is - new people cease being

A little perspective.  I've already got more games programmed on more servers than any other modern designer, by far.  My best game, Oust, is vastly superior to Go.  Oust won't peak until hundreds of years after I'm gone.  My very best games such as Oust, Fractal, Atoll, etc. will span the centuries, independent of what servers have implemented which of my games so far, or which of my games Graham decides to embrace.

Indeed, I've played and thoroughly enjoy Atoll, and Oust looks very
interesting to me, even though I've not yet gotten around to playing
it. However, your previous paragraph rather implied that popularity is
a good indicator of whether or not a game is "good". In that context,
Oust is a very poor game compared to Go, and it's a toss up between Go
and Chess for the "best" game, with Go being played by more players
but far far fewer countries, and it's mostly unheard of in the West.

If I'm honest, I think that's a relatively poor metric to judge a game
on anyway - Redstone is interesting, and whilst it's hard to judge
it's merits on depth compared to Go, it's certainly fun to play. Atoll
I suspect will not be as popular as Hex, for the simple reason that
Hex was around first, and Atoll adds a layer of goal complexity that
hex doesn't have. For what it's worth, I think Atoll is a better game,
but I still think the future will see it as a cute variation on Hex,
rather than an original game in its own right (fairly or otherwise).
I'm also a big fan of Havannah, which is probably the most potentially
interesting (to me) implementation of Hex I've seen. I haven't played
it enough to make a fair comparison.

One trend I do see is the desire for simplicity. Go is popular because
it's simple to learn, and Redstone adds a fair amount of complexity to
the way the game develops. Hex is popular because it's about as simple
an abstract game as you can develop - atoll adds a small layer of
complexity to it. In both cases, I think the extra layer of complexity
will be a primary reason why the take up is low. Why play Redstone
when you can play Go? Why play atoll when you can play Hex? There are
games, such as gomoku, where the balance is sufficiently poor and hard
to solve that complicated opening rules are constructed to balance the
game (renju), where there is a niche for complexity by necessity.
However, despite it's lack of balance, more people still play gomoku.

I hate to say it, but originality helps too. Redstone is too close to
Go to feel original, and Atoll is too close to Hex to feel original.
Oust is both extremely simple to learn, and appears somewhat
deceptively deep, and doesn't look like a close ripoff of another
game. Those three factors stand it in very good stead I suspect. I
still struggle to believe there will be much take up in the scale of
thousands of players or more, but it seems deserving of attention to
me. I can't see any justification for it being superior to Go however.

Either way, Chess and Go are played by literally billions of people,
and in both sports (particularly Go, due to cultural reasons), one can
earn a very nice living at the top in either. Magnus Carlsen currently
brings in 1.5m USD a year, and the top Go professionals earn around
twice that. Xiangqi, Shogi and Checkers are all original and popular,
although not outstandingly simple in the case of the first two.

I really don't believe Oust will compete on that scale, and I don't
think that's Oust's fault, but my initial reaction when seeing a claim
that a game is vastly superior to games with such overwhelming
popularity is that the spokesman doesn't know what he's talking about
- sorry to be blunt, and I'm not saying you don't know what you're
talking about, but that's the impression the statement gives. If it's
vastly superior, Go players will switch to playing it, much as I
switched primarily from chess to Go as my personal hobby. If they
don't, it's fairly likely that your game isn't superior. One
subjective sign for me that an abstract game is "good" is the lack of
ability of an AI to become skilled at it. I suspect Oust will be much
easier for an AI to play than Go or Chess, which to me detracts from
my long term hopes for it.

Yes, I'd like to see Redstone take off more sooner than later.  I'm only human and I'm having fun with this shit.  I will not be modifying my behavior one iota to appease snotty Go players (not that you're snotty, Graham).  It wouldn't make any difference if I did.  If Redstone was meant to fly, it will fly, regardless of how "adult" I behave.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Actually, my comment was meant more constructively than it clearly
came across. My underlying point was supposed to be that behaviour
does impact the initial takeup when working in a niche area such as
abstract board games. Sure, if 20,000 people are playing your game,
you could be the reincarnation of Kenghis Khan and it will fly just as
well as if you were Mother Theresa, but getting there in the first
place often relies on word of mouth endorsement and support. Such is
the price of getting things out there.

This was hardly a throat ripping.  I would call it a mild rebuke in response to myself and others I've spoken with privately being put off by Christian's forum stuffing.

Rga is more of a working environment than a thriving community.  Kind of a hotbed of metadesign.  You run your thriving community and let us run ours.

I'm seeing pots and kettles. I know the two of you have an impressive
amount of personal animosity, and I also know that you have been
accused of the same things you accuse Christian of. However, the forum
stuffing thing is an amusing accusation. Of the last 50 threads, 2
were started by Christian, 10 by Nick Bentley, and 18 by yourself, by
far and aware the heaviest poster. Either the community is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>really<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
small, or starting over 35% of the active threads is a serious case of
forum stuffing. I have absolutely no interest in taking sides, and I
strongly suspect that this is 6 and half a dozen, but it does seem
that neither party is all that innocent here ;)

Not that I mind particularly, the community contributions on new games
actually looks really interesting and I'll mostly likely lurk for a
while at the very least.

Whatever you do, keep having fun with this shit, because the products
are always fun to read, think about, and try :)

PS On a constructive Redstone note, having now played a couple of
games at what I suspect is a reasonably competent level, can I
strongly recommend a 15x15 board as the default size - 11x11 seems too
small and fighty, and 19x19 I think will turn out to be too big for
the changes it makes over Go. Also, the pie rule I still think is an
excellent idea, but could I recommend that it's a 4 move pie rule to
force an assessment of the relative merits in each of the four corners
(which I suspect strong people will play) before deciding to switch or
move?
