Draws can be problematic and worse, they can be problematic in the
long run. Take the sorry situation in International Draughts:

The problem took almost a century to emerge. Even in 1946 the future
World champion (from 1948-1956) Piet Roozenburg won a world ranking
tournament with a score of 37 out of 40.
No more.
Draughts is terminal and in denial of it.

Draughts has a great architecture implemented on the wrong grid (or
rather the right grid in the wrong orientation). The very same
architecture is used in Hexdame, Croda and Dameo. In International
Draughts you generally need 4 kings to trap a lone one, in Hexdame 3,
in Coda and Dameo only 2 (courtesy of Turkish Draughts, although that
game has a very different architecture).

Draughts' architecture is great because it allows for combinations of
a fierce beauty, some named after the players first launching them.
The particular combination that got me into the game as a child is the
"Coup Raphael":

It's no denying that in the cold light of a century of massive
scrutiny has the game wrapped up now, because of too large a
drawmargin. Modern top players hardly make mistakes that lead them
outside of it, certainly not in match play. But that is not the result
of a faulty architecture, but rather of a faulty implementation.
Unless of course if you feel draws and good architecture are
incompatible in the first place. In the case of Draughts, that would
be a bad case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

Yet, just to rub it in, it should also be noted that where Draughts
grandmasters almost invariably draw against one another because
neither will overstep the drawmargin, beginners, although not usually,
may very well draw too. Not because they don't overstep the margin,
but because the overstepping evens out.

So "10x10 International Draws" is an unforunate case indeed, but is
what is basically a wrong implementation a reason to 'architectually'
remove draws from game inventing?
I think not. I think that draws should be like salt in a dish.
Draughts has become a dish in salt, and some would argue that this is
the fate of any game that holds the possibility (which isn't true of
course), but a game without it misses just that little bit extra.

So there's another side to this medal, I feel, but since when this
post is published, William may be King of Britain, I'll save that for
later.
