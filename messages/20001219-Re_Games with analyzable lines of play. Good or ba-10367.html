Not possible. There are more possible chess positions than there are

I disagree with the latter and concur with the former.
In fact, I believe that the world is already very close to a partial
solution of chess.

In your post you discussed the space and size required to store a
complete solution.  I would like to remind you that at one time; it was
not considered feasible that anyone would need more than 640KB of
memory, the faster a computer got-the larger it would have to be, the
turing test was considered unobtainable, and a slew of other things
that through human innovation we have proven mythical.

<b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>I<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> believe that a computer program will solve chess by 2020.
(It's a reasonable goal, I actually think it will happen before 2010,
but I figured a little leeway wouldn't hurt)
