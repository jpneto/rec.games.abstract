Hazen: Yes, every game is solvable.  But one oft overlooked consideration is board size.  Hex is solved for example on 11x11, but not on 21x21.  Christian Freeling bragged for years about his game being "perfectly balanced".  I challenged him repeatedly with the question of how balanced his game would be on a 3x3 board.  He always ignored the question, except when he was backpedaling, tap dancing, doing sommersaults, and jumping through hoops.  Bullshit artist extraordinaire.  Christ I hope he doesn't come here to talk about Sy... can't bring myself to say it.  I've got a cyanide pill just in case he does.
