All of the above, Hazen.  Creativity in any form is needed.  Not just minor modifications of existing games, but major breakthroughs.  For me, I'm kind of burned out on game design.  I can't seem to come up with anything new.  Plus I'm busy with law school.



Yes, revive the forum.  I think you can do it, Hazen.  You be the boss.

I was not born to be a leader nor a follower.
I was born to be free.
I will take my time to try to invent new games for blind people too and other people who are excluded from the joy of playing.
I`m very sick and I have at most 2 or 3 years to live.
I do not want to quit smoking nor drinking even I drink less now.
My hope is to have enough energy to finish my book. It will be written in french first then I will supervise the spanish and arabic translation.
Maybe my niece will translate it english (she studied in London - Great Britain).
It is time for me to rest little bit.
Have a good day!
