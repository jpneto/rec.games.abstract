Interesting. Will there always be a move available, and if not, then

I would think that when the board is all kings, no move is available?

Strange.  Like watching left-handed guitar players in their fingering.

Er... thanks? :-) Maybe you're referring to that feeling of obscure
familiarity... I've felt that, too.

Now, seriously, from its initial conception, Implo has undergone two
major changes: first the concept of promotion was introduced, then
placing stones of both colors was disallowed. The first has somewhat
shortened the longest possible game, while the second has hopefully
improved the game's strategic depth.

Interestingly, in the first draft of the game, without these changes,
the longest possible game had exacly (n+1)*n/2 moves, n being the
number of points of the board. Thus, on a tiny 5x5 board, the game
could last up to 325 moves! And 45 moves, the average chess game, in a
3x3 board! I don't know if the intriguing Rive matches that, but it
would be a close-run thing, indeed.

The current version, as I've said, is a bit shorter, but precise
calculations are harder to make.
