Mark, would you be so kind as to give me a direct quote from
this thread stating that the contest would be judged purely on
quality of play, and not at all on relevance.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I never said it was in this thread.  I said it was in "the discussion".

From the "Stacking Games Contest Judges" thread, Feb 21, 2011:
===============================================
Me: "I don't want to watch a video of the judges effectively
disqualifying Monkey Queen by saddling it with deductions
for 'not really a stacking game'"

Daniel: "I understand this and assure you that games will be
judged on which game the judges like best."
===============================================

Is that clear enough, Alex?  Can you now possibly shut the fuck up about the
admissibility of Monkey Queen?  Now that the contest is almost over?

Ohh, i've never claimed that i read that whole discussion, only this
one, in fact i downright said that i didn't read the other thread in
the other thread.  Sorry if my message was too ambiguous, but i did
mention above that i had gotten word from the other thread on how the
game was to be judged as soon as i saw it as well.

Oh shut the fuck up already.  I'm really getting tired of you.  I invited
you here in the hopes of bringing our private discussion about Monkey Queen
into a public format, but that didn't happen.  The only mention you ever
made of Monkey Queen here is about how it doesn't qualify for a contest
which you have no knowledge of.  Fuck off.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

You invited me to talk about how pie rule effected monkey queen, and
other games in general.  I discussed both extensively with you and CF
in the pie rule in monkey queen and other games in general thread, and
when no one had anything to add, the thread died as usual, so i'm not
sure what you are talking about by "that didn't happen."  did i not
post in a thread you created that you wanted me to post in, because if
that is the case, i just didn't know, so... sorry?
Also, i don't know what you are talking about that i accused monkey
queen of not being qualified for the contest.  In fact, while no one
ever asked, i think it is a fine addition to the contest.  i didn't
even know i was accused of doing so until now.  I did talk about my
binary judgement system, and relevance as criteria, but the first one
wasn't directed at anything, and nothing was mentioned with it, and so
i have no idea where you would have gotten that it was directed at
MQ.  The second had nothing to do with allowing something into the
contest or not, and thus i never would have immagined or guessed that
you would think i was trying to get MQ DQ'ed.  I'm sorry if you
misinterpreted something i said, but i don't know how i was suppost to
word things differently to make it clear i wasn't talking about MQ
beyond not mentioning MQ when i was talking about it.
