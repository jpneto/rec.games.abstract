Among the many and varied names for this game I've heard are:
 Russian Ratscrew
 Mongolian Mousefuck
 Egyptian Rodent Copulation
 Mongolian Mouse (for the ears of the more tender players)
 Global Thermonuclear War.

the rules that i learned are as follows:

(this next rule i am not too sure if it is 'standard' but i always insist on
   it whenever i play)
when one player has finally acquired all the cards, he must run through the
  entire deck one last time so the other players can slap in if doubles 
  should occur.  this can be skipped if you are pressed for time.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Ooch.  I don't think that would work where I play, since games
routinely last multiple hours.  (There are usualy enough players trying to
'slap in' that short games are rare.)

</pre><blockquote type=cite><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
any time anyone does something illegal, the offending player must take the
  top card from their hand and place it, face up, at the bottom of the 
central pile.  such "illegal" actions include, but are not limited to:
[...]

	So what do you do when a player <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>knows<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> that there's a jack 4 cards
down in his pile and slaps the pile 3 times 'by accident'?  (Thus we
instituted the 'Ben Rule' of no more than 2 false slaps per player per
round.)

ummm... i think that's it - i feel as though i have forgotten something, but
 i cant think of what.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">
	Nope, I think that was a pretty good listing of the rules as I know
them.  (But then again, there are people who play with jokers.(instant
double.) or declare that any matching <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>suit<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> is slappable. ("ultrascrew")
