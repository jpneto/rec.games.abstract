Anyhow, it's an interesting phenomenon to me:  it's not enough for a
game to be good; it also has to be popular.  If it's not popular, it'll
die out (or at best attract a small cult following) no matter how good
it is.

Well, as a <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>player<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> of games, I couldn't give a whit whether a game is
popular or not.  I only care if it brings me some measure of enjoyment
or mental stimulation.  You have to remember that the market for
abstracts (aside from Chess and Xiangi (can never spell that)) is
miniscule already.  That's the reason (IMO) that there are so few
"popular" games in the first place.  There are too many abstract games
and not enough people to play them.  This is why I created Super Duper
Games (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://superdupergames.org">http://superdupergames.org</a>), to find at least some opponents for
interesting and largely unplayed abstracts.  If you are looking solely
to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>study<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> games, then Chess and Xiangi are the places to be.  You
simply will not find literature on most others (including the "big
ones" like the GIPF family, etc...).  I personally would rather play a
game than study it any day =)

Cheers!
