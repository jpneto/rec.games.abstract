Cameron,

I like Stax, mostly.  I think it is more elegant than Hive and
promises sharp tactics, and possibly also good strategic depth based
on stack heights.  But I have two concerns.  Might it not prove very
difficult to win if an opponent concentrates on defense, keeping his
king high and working to keep adjacent stacks less accesible and
therefore short?  Hive is known to be drawish between strong players,
and I'd be concerned that Stax is the same or worse because of the
mobility limitations imposed by the stack heights.  The other thing I
don't like is the memory factor.  In fact, it takes it out of my
definiton of perfect information game if you must rely on memory to
know the properties of the covered pieces.  A rule allowing free
examination of covered pieces would be good, but also somewhat
awkward.  A physical design where you can see the moves of all the
pieces in the stack, perhaps something like Octi, would be something
to consider.
