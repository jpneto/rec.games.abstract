A.K. Dewdney, in his book "The Planiverse" (a sci-fi book exploring the
science of a 2D universe) mentioned a 2 player game called Alak. Alak was
described as go in 1D, but that doesn't work as a serious game.  So I
fiddled with the rules a bit and came up with something with surprisingly
complex strategy.

Rules:
1. Black and white alternate placing stones on a line divided into n points.
2. If placing a stone surrounds/outflanks stones of the opposite color,
those stones are immediately captured.
3. It is illegal to place a stone where one was just captured.
4. The game ends when the player having the move cannot move.
5. The winner is the player with the most pieces on the board.
Examples:
Here are all 3 possible Alak-3 games (excluding symmetry).  Each line
represents a state in the game.  Capitals represent the last piece played.
/ represents captured squares.
  012    012    012
1.X--  1.X--  1.-X-
2.x-O  2./O-  2.Ox-
3.xX/  3.-oX  3.oxX
  2-0  4.Oox    2-1
         1-2
Here's an example of Alak-6.
012345
X-----
x--o--
x--oX-
x--o/O
xX-o-o
//Oo-o
--ooX/
O-oox-
/X//x-
-x--xO (forced)
-x-Xxo
-xO//o (to do otherwise would lose 4-2)
Xxo--o
xxo-Oo
xx/X//
3-0

Any ideas on strategy for Alak-n?
Anyone want to challenge me to Alak-11?
