I'm an avid Othello player, and would be interested to hear from any
other fans of the game out there.  Is there an interest, for example,
in seeing Othello puzzles, annotated game transcripts, and the like?
How much do people on the net know about the game?  My experience in
the past has been that most people know very little about proper play,
which involves primarily mobility optimization rather than control of key
squares, such as edges.  Would anyone be interested in a sporadic
series of posts covering basic Othello strategy and tactics?  I'd be
more than willing to contribute anything I can to this group, given
enough interest.

Would anybody who knows the basics be interested in a postal match?
Perhaps if there's enough interest, we could set up a postal tournament?
Or perhaps somebody with enough skills could put together an Othello
server similar to the existing Chess and Go servers?

How about computer Othello programs?  Everybody and their pet chimp seems
to have written one, but the quality varies widely.  Are people interested
in discussing programming techniques and computer-specific strategies?
This group could be the ideal forum.

I'll be interested to hear people's responses to these questions.  Hopefully
those of us with an interest in the game will finally have a newsgroup
in which to discuss it, much like rec.games.chess and rec.games.go for
those games.
