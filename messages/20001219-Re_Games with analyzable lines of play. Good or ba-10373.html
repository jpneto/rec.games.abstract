What are other people's opinions on this?  Would you rather have a
game, like chess, where books could be written on openings, set lines
of play, etc... or a game so deep and open-ended, that doing such

I prefer open-ended games where there are many ways of getting from A
to B.  I agree with the guy who posted the comment that he likes to use
intuition in games.  I find it frustrating to sift through 17 possible
actions to come up with the optimal one.  Games which rely on this
mechanism too much feel like an interactive puzzle, as opposed to an
interactive narrative.

Unfortunately, I have yet to find the boardgame that truly captures my
ideal of an interactive and strategic narrative.  The only game that
comes close is the "King of Dragon Pass" PC game.  Under the theme of
leading a tribe in a fictional world rich in myth, KoDP presents you
with choices with no best response.  All of the options are interwoven
with the history and character of setting in such a way that you
succeed by adopting mythic values, moreso than by finding a formula to
overwhelm your neighbours with Weaponthanes.  If a boardgame could use
the design of KoDP to allow for ftf multiple players I would find
gaming Nirvanna.
