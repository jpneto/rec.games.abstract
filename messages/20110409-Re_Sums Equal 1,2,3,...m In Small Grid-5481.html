This can be considered both a puzzle and a solitaire game.

Make an n-by-n grid on paper. (I suggest that n = 3 for beginners.)

Fill the grid with UNIQUE positive integers, one integer per square of
the grid. The numbers need not be consecutively valued necessarily.

Your score is the largest integer m such that integers 1 through m all
occur as sums within the grid (without missing any positive integers
&lt;=m).

A "sum" is of any number of addends (possibly just 1) that are all
consecutively placed within a row of the grid or a column of the grid.
(No diagonals in this variation.)

So, for example, if we have the following 3-by-3 grid:

2 9 8
3 1 10
7 6 15

...the sums 1 through 19 all occur in this grid. So, I get a score of
19.
(Notice that some values of sums occur more than once.)

I bet it is easy to do better than I did with a 3-by-3 grid, since my
grid is inefficient, and I didn't try too hard to find it.

(Note: There are 27 possible sums in a 3-by-3 grid of 1, 2, or 3
addends. I don't know what the largest possible score is for a 3-by-3
grid, though.)

You can "play" someone else by both of you trying to score as well as
you can on the same-sized grid. Just try to outscore your opponent.

interesting.  for 3x3 the best I can get is 20 (I think) using this:
13 6 12
7  2 14
10 3  1

I am loathe to write a program to compute the best score, but perhaps
some other enterprising person could make the attempt.  bonus points for
not using c or perl, of course.  demerits for using recursion, blowing
the stack, or causing a core fault in the math subprocessor.

 From a program I wrote:
  3  1 17      3   4  21   1  18  17     3  16  23  13  20   7
 13  9  2     13  22  24   9  11   2     1  10  15   9  14   5
  7  5  6      7  12  18   5  11   6    17  19  25   2   8   6

The square is shown in 3 left columns of numbers; sums of row 
elements appear in middle 6 columns; and sums of column elements
in left 6 columns.  For example, sums for a row p q r are listed
in order p, p+q, p+q+r, q, q+r, r.  The two repeated sums are
11 = 9+2 = 5+6 and 18 = 1+17 = 7+5+6.

The program, written in C and recursive to depth at most 28,
takes about 20 minutes to exhaustively test all possibilities.
There are 9 other #25 squares with 1 and 2 in the positions 
shown, and all #25 squares have 1 and 2 in the middle cells 
of adjacent sides, if my program is to be believed.

documentation will count for 15% of your final grade, and keep future
programmers from cursing your name for the clever and obscure ways you
found to save 11 bytes worth of typing that cost them more than an hour
of their life which they won't get back.

it seems obvious that the best grids of size n+1 are not supersets of
the best grid of size n.  that makes this game more fun as you progress.

"Not supersets" could hold for small grids like this, and completely
fall down for large grids.  It's easy to imagine that a best N x N
grid, N a few billion, could look very much like a best N+1 x N+1 grid.
