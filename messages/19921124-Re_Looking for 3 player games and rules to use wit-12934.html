The domino game I like best is Five-Up.  This is best played with
four people, so you can play partners, though you can also play with
two or three.

Usually you use double-six dominoes, though I suppose you could use
double-nines or twelves if you wanted.  First, draw to decide who leads
for the first hand.  Then each player takes five tiles.  The rest of
the tiles stay face down in the boneyard.

The person who won the draw places a tile on the table, and the other
players do the same in turn.  As in most domino games, each tile must 
be placed end-to-end with a tile already on the table, and must match
it in number; however doubles are played sideways, so that they cross
the line.  You can play off the end of a double, but only after both
sides have been played on.  If you are unable to play, you must draw 
from the boneyard until you can.

What distinguishes Five-Up from traditional dominoes is that you can
score during play, and not just at the end of each hand.  (This gives 
the game a faster-moving feel.)  Specifically, if you play in such a
way that the total number of pips exposed at the ends of the configuration
is a multiple of five, you receive that number of points divided by 
five.  (For example:  Suppose the first player leads the 4-2.  The 
second player plays the 2-6.  The 4 and the 6 are now on the ends.
4+6 = 10, which is a multiple of 5, so the second player receives
2 points -- 10 divided by 5.)

Note: even though you can play off the ends of a double after both
sides have been covered, you do not count these ends for the purpose
of scoring, UNLESS one of the sides is still exposed.

Play continues until one player goes out (that is, until a player
does not have any more tiles left in his or her hand), or until no 
one can play.  In the former case, the opposing team exposes their 
hands.  Count the total number of pips; the team which went out 
receives that number of points divided by five.  If no team goes
out, all players show their hands.  Determine which team has the 
smallest number of pips, and score the hand as though that team 
had gone out.

A game is to 61 points (one tour of a cribbage board).  The final 
hand must be completed.  The lead rotates each hand.

I realize I've described this a little tersely, but I hope it's clear.
This is a fun game; one of my favorites.
