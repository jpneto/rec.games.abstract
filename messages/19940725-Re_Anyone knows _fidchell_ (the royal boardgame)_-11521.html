   According to <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>Period Pastimes<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>, by Patrick J. Smith, fidchell is lumped into
a generic class of games that include the Viking hnefatafl, the alea evangeli of
the Anglo-Saxons, the Welsh gwyddbwyll, the hala tafi of the Icleanders and the
tablut of the Finns and Lapps.

   All the above are played on square boards of varying sizes, from seven
squares an a side to as many as 23 (always an odd number, though).  One player
had a numerical advantage over the other.  One side has a king (always starting
in the center of the board--that's why the odd number of squares) and a number
of men ( eight on the 7X7 board, to perhaps 40 for the 23X23).  The other 
player had twice as many men but no king.  

   All pieces had the same move--like a rook in chess.  The starting patterns
varied, but all had the king surrounded by his own men at the start.  Capture
of pieces was accomplished by flanking a piece by two opposing pieces, though
often a piece moving between two others voluntarily was not considered caught.
To win:  the king had to reach the edge of the board, or the other player had
to pen the king so he could not move (all four sides).

   Other variations had it that no piece could occupy the center square at 
any time <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>except<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the king.  In others, the king had to announce the exist-
ance of a clear run to the edge before he took it.

Hope this helps--have fun playing.

(one of these days, I've <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>got<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> to make up a set!)
