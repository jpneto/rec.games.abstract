Woops...  My previous message was not really supposed to be blank.   :(
 
I was trying to explain a game I played in the 'not exactly like
Mornington Crescent more like that Reality game someone was talking
about' category.  The name of the game is 'Water Tiger Duck' and it
seemed quite good for a large group of people. 
 
'Water Tiger Duck' is played something like 'Rock Paper Scissors' but in
teams, and a team can choose to be anything not just Water, Tiger or
Duck.  The group divides into two teams and a judge.  The two teams
consult in private to each decide what they want to be, and then come
back together.  On the judges signal, all the members of each team
<span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>act out<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> what their team has chosen to be.  The judge interprets the
performances and chooses a winner.  For example "Tiger eats Duck" or
"Duck floats on Water".  In the game I played in, the final decision was
"Spirit transcends Time".
