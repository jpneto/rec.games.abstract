Go Basics: Concepts and Strategies for New Players

By Peter Shotwell

Tuttle Publishing $16.95

Go Basics introduces a new way to learn to play the game of go.
Designed by well-known go writer Peter Shotwell, author of Go! More
Than a Game, it is the first book to concentrate solely on 9x9 games
for ease and simplicity. Without the distractions that larger boards
create, this unique approach can quickly bring younger kids into the
game with the guidance of parents, while older ones can learn from the
book on their own. Time-harried adults will also enjoy it because they
will quickly grasp the main principles of go, which are the same for
all sizes of boards.

The first half is a specially-chosen tournament game, played by
professionals, that takes readers from the opening to the end game,
while covering the fundamental moves and strategies.

The second half has six more professional tournament games that
spectacularly illustrate advanced concepts and prepare readers for
playing on bigger boards. These include the techniques of large and
small sacrifices, how to invade, how to play ko, and how to think
territorially. It is hard to believe that what takes place in these
games is on small boards, so Go Basics will also appeal to experienced
players who like the speed and excitement of "lunch-time" go.

Another big bonus is that Go Basics is the first book to include the
American Go Association CD-ROM. Its hundreds of features include how to
find other players on and off the Internet, more teaching games, and an
e-library with many articles on the world of professional and amateur
go. There is also the story of the game's considerable influence in
Eastern and Western history, science, literature and art.

But perhaps the best feature of the CD is Igowin, an interactive 9x9
game program that gives handicaps so readers can begin playing
immediately. By taking a short-cut and following the lessons in the
last chapter of Go Basics, they can quickly bring their games down to
even and begin playing 'real' go, while they learn from the rest of
the book!
