Daniel was on iggc this morning, so he's basically just ignoring us. I don't
understand the wimpout.  Why put all that work into the contest and then
totally wimp out right before the end?

Just render a verdict, Daniel.  If you've got 5 judges.  If you've got 3
judges.  If you've got just Declan.  Render a fucking verdict.  Close out
the contest.

Christian, fellow contestants, what do you want to do?  If Daniel has really
flaked out, which, now looking back at how he tried to disqualify a third of
the games six months into the contest, wouldn't surprise me, we could find a
bgg aficionado to run the contest there.  I think bgg is pretty much set up
for it.  It'll be biased and sucky compared to what Daniel promised us, but
I think I'd rather have biased and sucky closure to the contest than none at
all.
