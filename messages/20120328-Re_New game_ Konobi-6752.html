Not that I doubt Konobi's excellence.  It's just that you can't really help promote anything using a non-credible nickname such as Player, Bozo, etc..

This forum does not really promote anything but it is a good place to check for new games. However, the people who frequent it can do promotion elsewhere. For example, Mr. Freeling is well known at Little Golem and if he tried to promote Konobi there then it would mean something. Or at least he could implement Konobi at his own site. Therefore I addressed the problems he raised in his post. I know that he thinks rather highly of Slither and my  impression was that the initial difficulties in learning Konobi are rather similar to those of Slither while Konobi offers static connections which is a big plus. And I also congratulated the author in order to "promote" his further work as a designer. I was very impressed by his earlier XOdd and now by this game. What I especially like is that his games can be played on small Go boards, have deep gameplay and are not simple modifications of existing games.

Certainly, there is a downside of using a nickname  Player or Bozo in that it would be somewhat embarassing to start a thread like "Player" a.k.a. "Bozo" etc.  which is quickly becoming a specialty of this forum. For each forum its own.
