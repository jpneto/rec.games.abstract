Clark, I don't have a beef with you.  You're a textbook psychopath,

Yep, definitely no beef here... I don't think you have the slightest
idea of what a psychopath is. Your recent spell of journalism, was
nearly on par with a classic Glenn Beck chalkboard conspiracy in terms
of journalistic integrity.

As long as I'm coming clean, Ralf Gering has also earned my respect
with Kauri.  I like the concept.  Oddly, Kauri is either non-decisive
or infinite, depending on which version, but as I've become fond of
saying, not everything has to be my thing.  Rest assured, Ralf Gering
is not flattered by my compliment.  In Ralf's tortured mind Kauri is
finite-decisive and I'm spreading malicious lies about his game.

Ralf has constructed a bizarre universe in which he is an unbiased

oh boy, of course! The ultimate "beef" of this post, my dwindling

post to a newsgroup)

No it doesn't, as I told him, it doesn't really need a point, now does
it? I explained why I designed the game, beyond that there's no need
for justification. I didn't spend anybody's tax dollars on it.

I wasn't purposefully "dodging the argument". I wasn't sure that the
"argument" was entirely relevant to what I was saying. I didn't say
draws were volatile but I said a high draw rate is one factor that can
break a game. Unlike you I'm not about to say that drawless games are
automatically worse than draw-free ones. In fact, unlike you, I really
don't feel it's my place to say what games are good, I just expect a
better justification for Chess's reputation than that reputation
itself. At least Go players can say that Go has a lot of depth. Chess
has no real substance to it. It's just the sort of mess you'd get
playing game mechanic Bingo.

BGG is apparently a terrible place to have a discussion about "game
design". You say something like "meh, Chess isn't such a great game"
and they jump on you like a pack of manic Chess loving zombies. BGG is
just a shambles in general and I can find few redeeming qualities for
it. The abstract forum appears to be nothing but perpetual circle-
jerking over the same handful of games.

Yeah, it's like they want somebody to take your place as a social
pariah. Who better to fill that spot than the one person who won't
stroke the cock of the community's collective ego. All I'm doing is
looking out for the little guy. At any rate I certainly presented my
arguments against Chess with a great deal more integrity than when you
whined and bellyached about Gipf, where your arguments against it
amounted to something like, "Gipf? More like Shipft!".

Way to go Steere. This is some really primo spam here.
