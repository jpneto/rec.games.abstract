Yes, I've been playing this game for a couple of years.  It's a very
good game.  But it has it's own flaws.  Like Y, cells near the center
are extremely important, more important than in Hex, and this limits
the depth a little, IMO.

You can play a version that is quite close to the one presented by
luigi, in real time at the ig game center, by opening a game of Mind
Ninja an selecting the pattern "Almost Y".  The differences are: in
the online version corners don't belong to sides, and the first mover
is trying to form the pattern described by Luigi, and the other is
trying to prevent it.  But since this can only be done by forming the
same pattern, it amounts to the same thing.  These changes were
introduced in order to balance the game more to the second player's
favor, but honestly, I don't think it's really an improvement over the
version Luigi describes.  (although there are some unusual tactics
having to do with the corners. Specifically, in the online version,
player 2 can now try to "funnel" his opponent towards corners in order
to prevent the Y pattern from forming.

I'm in the middle of playing some bizarre variations on Cameron
Browne's Cross by email at the moment.  I hope one of them works,
because they are really strange.

About Havannah: yeah, it's a bit lame.  But the tactics are very rich
and interesting, which I believe is mainly due to the presence of the
loop win condition.
