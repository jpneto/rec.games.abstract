You're right. I got confused by Phil's mention of zugzwang and the
like. Obviously, player 1 won't be willing to set up a position where
the first/second player to move wins regardless of his side, because
player 2 will then choose to play first/second and win. Likewise,
player 1 won't set up a position where Black/White wins regardless of
moving first or second.

Still, it's an unnecessarily complicated mechanism. Instead, an
extended pie rule where player 1 sets up a position and player 2
chooses sides (with White moving first, for instance) is simpler and
equally effective.

Constructing a position where both players have equal winning chances
regardless of which side moves first must be almost impossible: if the
position is balanced, he who moves first will have an advantage (the
turn order advantage). An empty board is an example of such position,
and you can't get more balanced than that :-)

So, in short, player 1 must create a position which is balanced when a
certain side moves first. But that's exactly the same as the extended
pie rule I've mentioned.

Imagine a position which is balanced if and only if White moves first,
and a likely Black win otherwise. If player 2 chooses to be Black,
player 1 will be White and choose to move first. If player 2 chooses
to move first, player 1 will move second and choose to be Black. As
player 1 has already studied the position, his decision is automatic.
The extended pie rule (with White moving first) produces exactly the
same result with fewer steps. There is no added balance in the
additional step of Pylyx's mechanism.
