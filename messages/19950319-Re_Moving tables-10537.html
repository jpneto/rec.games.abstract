The March 1995 column on the table-shifting problem was the most
frustrating yet.  I'd really like to be able to understand what he's
talking about... and I can't.  I thought I'd look in some of his
references, but whaddaya know... there aren't any.

Can anyone here clarify Stewart's discussion?  Or point me to a
clearer exposition?  Or tell me Stewart's email address so I can whine
to him directly?

It seemed pretty clear to me, but then I'd played with a computer version
of a similar puzzle. I think it was mentioned in this group a while
ago and referred to as "The Viking Game". What part of the discussion was
unclear?

Also, Stewart does give at least one reference. It's to one of the
"Winning Ways" books, and if I remember right it's buried in the text
somewhere near the illustration of the Donkey/Century configuration.
