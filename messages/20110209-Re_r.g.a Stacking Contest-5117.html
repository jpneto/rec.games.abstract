I already apologized for freaking out, but since you're bringing it up
again, I'll tell you what lead to my presumption of ill intent.  For an
entire day, I was trying to make the case that a public vote would slant the
contest against me.  The whole time, I was getting a big load of shit from
the group, mainly from you, Christian.  "Stop being paranoid, Mark!"  "We
the inventors need the voters!"  "Blah blah blah blah blah!"

How about can the shit, take my concerns seriously, and work to find a
solution, instead of arrogantly dismissing my concerns as ridiculous?  After
a whole day of this shit, yes, it started to seem like an agenda.  What's
unfortunate is that Michael's intelligent solution of using judges had to be
preceded by 24 hours of asinine bullshit.
