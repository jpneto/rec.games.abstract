When both players pass in succession, the game ends. The player with less groups on the board wins.
At first, I considered having the opposite goal and was happy to name
it Splyt, but found that joining is more intuitive than splitting, and
that's what connection games are about in the first place. Of course,
with the right to place stones of both colors, the game is still
effectively the same.

I can't figure out how different it would be, smallest number of
groups or largest. Intuitively I'd go for 'largest', but then you'd
have to split yourself and join the opponent instead of vice versa.

Both variants doubtlessly have intruiging strategies and my guess is:
fairly similar (more so than Draughts and its misere variants). Also,
neither is counterintuitive: split as most you can or join as most you
can.

Christian, the game is <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>exactly<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> the same in both cases. Since you can
play stones of both colors, playing Black in 'Splitting' Yodd is the
same as playing White in 'Joining' Yodd. There aren't <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
strategical or tactical differences.
