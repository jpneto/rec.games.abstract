Interestingly, both Awari games described on this column differ from the
one that I have.  I posses an Awari set which came from Ghana where the
game is played extensively and where gambling on the game is common.

My set has not end containers, and is therefore simply 6 cups opposite
another 6 cups -- the game beginning with 4 seeds in each cup.

The problem here seems to be that no one knows for sure what the actual
name for the game they're playing is. Your set sounds like the arrangement
for Awari. The game that most of the others are talking about is Kalah -
I posted a set of rules to it yesterday. Aside from both using cups and
pits and having a similar way of moving, the games have little in common
in the way of strategy.

Since this seems to be confusing a lot of people, maybe the Subject
line could be changed? If you're talking about Kalah, pehaps change it
to 'Kalah Strategies'.
