What would Othello be like if you could only flip pieces along the
rook's-move lines ("orthogonally"), but not diagonally?  Anyone
tried it?

After a very brief experiment I have concluded that "Orthello" is
boring, boring, boring.  The main differences are:

  It's very hard to flip more than 6 pieces in a single move, since
  it's too hard to set up a capture along the horizontal and diagonal
  lines simultaneously.

  It's very hard for Player 2 to get a foothold on a side, once
  Player 1 has gotten there.  The Othello tactic of

   ...ox...         ...o....
   ....x...    or   ...xx...
   ....x...         ...x....

   ...ox...         ...o....
   ....o...         ...xo...
   ....xo..         ...x.o..

  no longer works when you can't capture diagonally.
