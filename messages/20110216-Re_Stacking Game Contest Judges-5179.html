Ok, let's ask Omar, that is, if there are no objections from
other contestants.

My only reservation about Omar is that he's obviously a huge Christian
Freeling fan, but who isn't?  Wayne Schmittberger wouldn't judge the contest
for precisely that reason.  He didn't feel he could be objective.  I'm not
going to worry about judge prejudice though.  It won't be nearly as fucked
as general public prejudice and in any case there's no way around it.  Let's
just get on with it.

As far as judging criteria, I think originality and quality of play are a
good start and maybe that's all we really need.  Thoughts?

Are all of the games programmed?  I think the programming links should be
included in the game links thread, so people can see the games and where to
play them instead of searching around for programming links after that.
