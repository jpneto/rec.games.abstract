And finally as expected Nestor came to thank everyone for having participate to the big masquerade.
Now it is time for him to reward (behind the scenes) all the actors.
How people could be dumb at this point!!!

It is worse than the vote in totalitarian regimes.
In totalitarian regimes you fear for your life so it is understandable that any criticism has consequences on your life.
But in BGG no one will kill you. The worst case is an IP ban!!!
Not only people are dumb and hugely dumb but the are COWARDS!!!! NO BALLS AT ALL!!!
I was banished more than 10 times so I could not intervene to say how big is that masquerade.
I do not want to create another account to "terrorize" the organizers and to put all their projects for what they are : staging staging staging photoshopping photoshopping photoshopping lying lying lying 

I do not expect someone breaking the silence.
Except Mark Steere they are all COWARDS!!! AND DUMBS!!!
