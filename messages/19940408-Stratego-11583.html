To all people who know the game Stratego

To get my Masters Degree at the University in Amsterdam, I have to
implement a Stratego-playing program. I have some questions involving
the game of Stratego.

1. In Holland Stratego is a well-known game. How is the game known in
   your country.

2. Do you know any Stratego-playing programs which play reasonably
   strong and how strong do they play. I have some programs written for
   the PC, but they play poorly, although the graphic part is made 
   professionally. They also don't play honest, because they make use
   of the fact that the player has to give his arrangement to the computer
   in order to display this arrangement on the screen. They use the
   this knowledge for example to avoid the bombs.

3. Do you know any literature about the topic Stratego.

4. Is there a kind of club in which Stratego-players are joined, or
   is there something as a championship.
