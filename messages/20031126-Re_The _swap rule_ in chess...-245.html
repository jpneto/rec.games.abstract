 On the other hand, three-move equalization will balance out the win 
rate, but at the cost of increasing the number of draws. Everyone, as 
white, will steer for a position where black acheives equality quickly, 
(This is not obvious with three moves, but if you were to hypothesize, 
say, five, it's much clearer. The principle is the same, however) since 
that's the only way to insure that you aren't at a disadvantage.

First of all, just because a position is "equal" doesn't mean it will
tend to lead to a draw. In five moves from the starting position (three by
white, two by black) you can create some very tactical, even explosive,
positions. Or, you could create a relatively quiet position with lots of
hidden nuances. In either case, the player who is more familiar with
the principles behind this opening will have some advantage, assuming
the players are of equal strength.

Consider the example I gave: 1.e4 2.e5 3.Nf3 4.f5 5.Bc4. Last I heard,
the verdict on this "corkscrew" variation is that white's attack will run
out of steam against proper defense. But if you know your opponent doesn't
do well defending such positions, and you are familiar with the opening, you
might set this position up anyway.

But with 5-move EQ, the first player makes ALL these five moves. That
means you can set up variations which would never occur in a game between
two strong players in normal chess. For example, bring both queens out!
Expose the kings! Most of such positions would be imbalanced. But there are
well over 10 million possible positions the first player could create. Some of
them are bound to be suitable for two grandmasters. I disagree that a game
begun this way would tend to be a draw.

In fact, the main objection to 5MEQ might be that opening preparation could
become more important than ever. The player who "cuts the pie" could devise
all sorts of elaborate traps for both sides, which the player who "chooses
the slice" could fall into regardless of which side is chosen. I don't deny
this is a valid objection to this opening protocol. But any proposal to
change the rules of chess is bound to have some downside.

 It's also not at all clear that three-move equalization would result in 
people playing a greater variety of positions, either, as people might 
quickly settle on a few three-move positions that give both players more 
room for play.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

I don't follow what the incentive would be for players to "settle on a few
positions." Most strong players would rather win games than draw them.
There are over 10 thousand positions the first player could create with
3MEQ. Most of what I said about 5MEQ applies to 3MEQ as well, although
there is admittedly less scope for the first player to devise a position
with traps on both sides.
