The basic idea is to have a game of chess (or any abstract strategy
game) and at least one side (if not both sides) collectively votes on
what the move should be. In event of a tie for votes, the first
proposed tied move would be the move the side would make. During a
given time period, people are allowed to change their votes.

Or there's Nomic, where you're voting on the rules you play by...

Any comments here? We may have something that is doable.

Existing collaborative games tend to force democracy on people that like
to win them: Scotland Yard will be a free run for any half smart Mr. X
if the (notionally separate) police players don't pool their thoughts
and act together.

Perhaps a more interesting scenario is in a multi-player game.
Something like 18xx but with railways run not by majority shareholding
director but by votes of share holders.  That could get interesting as
shareholders will have stakes in more than one company, so they don't
necessarily have an interest in the best possible performance of every
company they get a vote with.
