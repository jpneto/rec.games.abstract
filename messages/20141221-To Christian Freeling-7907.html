Hi,

I was banished as usual from BGG. 
So I could not answer to you.
You wrote :

"I tend to agree with that statement but not with your conclusion. There's nothing wrong with books on or courses in inventing abstract strategy games (even if they are given by failed inventors turned teachers). Without fakes, how would one recognise the real thing?"

When I said fake culture I meant the kind of behaviour of some people like Russ who are not game designers and who think wrongfully that books, interviews, what game designers in general are writing or saying all this "culture" is helpful for the wannabe game designers. Many things of what we call experts say are lies or at best idealizations (intellectual make-up) to make their work look like something unreachable and so on.
Designing games like any artistitic scientific or intellectual activity is :
-90% hard work (try and retry test and retest and so on)
- 5% luck (finding the good idea or the right path)
- 5% passion (you have to love your activity art science game litterature and so on).
Spreading the idea that reading others or even knowing what others accomplished is not NECESSARY. It could help little bit but not necessary.
Once you understand what is the core of the game activity you could design great games. Look at the kids or even at the animals (there are many studies about animal games) and see how they invent games. Look at all the cultures and see how people invent games.
No need for books nor fake culture (fake = superficial). The deepness no one will show what it is. You have to be involved body and soul to create something great. Anyone could create great games (hardwork luck and passion)..
Behind any great game you will find an individual passionnate lucky who worked lot.
