Until recently, Twixt fanatics like myself have had a free realtime server
to play on. Sundays around 3 to 4 p.m. East Coast US time was when we would
often get together. Sadly, there weren't very many of us; maybe
just a dozen or so "hardcore" players and over a hundred total registrants.

Sadly, K2z is now offline. Philippe has been telling me for some time now
that he could probably not afford to keep the website and server running.
He had plans to ask his boss. Apparently he was turned down.

My W98 machine with its phone modem connection are not enough to serve as
a host. But anyone with a 24/7 connection and a system from this century
would probably have enough power.

If you know anyone who could help, please have them contact either me at
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:twixt@cstone.net">twixt@cstone.net</a> or Philippe van Schendel at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pvs@wanadoo.fr">pvs@wanadoo.fr</a>

Thanks!
