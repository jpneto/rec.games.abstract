Hi,
I'd like to introduce my new stacking game "Mixtour".

Hmmm.  What don't I like about this game?  :)

In all of these games there will be things I don't like.  I'm just
discussing design philosophy at this point and not subtracting points from
anyone's game.

Don't assume that I'm going to grade your game harshly because I'm
inexplicably picking on it at this early stage.  Quite the opposite.  I'm
planning to give every game an identical score.

I feel like I've already won in a sense with Monkey Queen, independent of
the contest, and really because of the contest, with all the urgent (and
valued) feedback.  Now it doesn't matter so much if MQ wins or doesn't win
the contest, and I feel a little funny judging the other contestants' games.

I'm also primarily a hunter-designer and not really much of a player.  I
don't want to impose my ridiculous, arbitrary judgments of a game's quality
of play in numeric form on the contest.

If I did submit scores, they'd be virtually identical anyway.  Like I
wouldn't give it all to one player, etc.  I'd submit a perfect score for
each game minus "subtractions", and every game would have them.  It would be
virtually impossible for a design to meet my myriad standards, many
admittedly arbitrary.

So far all of the games have about the same amount of subtractions, except
Zwo, which might have a little more. (Just kidding.)  Seriously though,
Gert, and everyone, there's still time to submit more games.  You can only
improve your odds of winning because only your best game will be considered.

It wouldn't make a lot of sense for me to invest hundreds of hours
determining which of the entries gets an extra 1.25 percent which wouldn't
end up making any difference anyway.

If some future game submission blows me away, I'll give it 25% extra -
something that could realistically happen in the next two months, but which
hasn't happened yet.  All of the current games have already been ruled out
for that, independent of gameplay.  Nothing has really "grabbered" me.  I
like the mechanism in Grabber but it's a combinatorial, sharing the same
class with Mad Bishops and... oh shit... Monkey Queen.

I will certainly play all of the games more than once, and I will
undoubtedly have commentary on their gameplays as I perceive them.

Christian, I can't seem to resist picking on you today.  I was a little
surprised you selected a combinatorial for your entry.  I'd still be willing
to participate in a vote-down when the judgment period commences in the
Spring to determine your best game, as perceived by the judges, before it's
pitted against the other entries.

First thing about Mixtour: I love the game set graphic!  Very nice.

Reading the Mixtour rule sheet I was on the lookout for aesthetic Hiroshimas
and surprisingly didn't find any.  But I also didn't find a lot of wow
factor, an admittedly subjective measure.  Grabber has the grab.  Kinda
cool, though I'm a little biased since the same mechanism occurred to me
independently.

I have a game with a similar mechanism to Mixtour's.  Call it annihilation
or evacuation or whatever.  In Byte, all of the checkers start out on the
board.  None are added during play.  Stacks of exactly eight checkers are
formed and removed from the board, awarding a single point to the player
with the top checker.

Byte rule sheet:
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.marksteeregames.com/Byte_rules.pdf">http://www.marksteeregames.com/Byte_rules.pdf</a>

With 24 checkers, exactly three stacks of eight will form.  With 40 checkers
(on a 10x10), exactly five stacks of eight will form, both three and five
being odd numbers.  So Byte is naturally finite-conclusive.  There's no
arbitrary cutoff at having earned X number of points with an infinite
checker supply.

Mixtour didn't take me to new heights architecturally, though it does have
that receiving stack range feature which is interesting.

Now, all that negativity out of the way, Byte has been criticized for poor
clarity, and Mixtour undoubtedly does not have that problem.  So I'll
certainly have positive things to say about Mixtour's gameplay when I do
play it.
