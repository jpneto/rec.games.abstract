Because they can?  Why shouldn't the contestants be comfortable with the
judges?

Well that's obviously false because the contestants are having everything
their way and we do have a jury.

Nobody's "running the show" here.  Daniel is playing the role of contest
organizer, some aspects of which he's handled magnificently and some he
hasn't.  In private chat, Daniel didn't want to invite Cameron Browne or
anybody else to the contest out of embarrassment about rec.games.abstract.

?????  Thank you, Daniel.  I fully credit you for your efforts to get a
decent jury together.

Well, sure.  Me too.  I'll also gladly accept a bag full of unmarked 100s. 
What does that prove?  To me, Alex doesn't seem like a conscientious judge,
hence my objection.
