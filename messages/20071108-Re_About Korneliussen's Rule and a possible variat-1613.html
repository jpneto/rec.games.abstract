Compare "Power Grid", an auction and network game where you pay money
to occupy nearby cities, bid to buy power plants, and must buy scarce
fuel to power the plants. At the start of each turn, you determine who
is in 1st/2nd/3rd position. (Player with most cities is considered
winning; value of best power plant is the unique tie breaker.) For
each action, the winning player gets the worst turn position (first or
last, depending on the phase).  This gives losers an advantage that
may keep them in the game.

These rules also encourage players to take actions that HIDE the fact
that they are winning, an example being that a cheap power plant is
sometimes worth more (and sometimes costs more at auction) than an
expensive power plant. That's not a bad thing, it's just another
interesting aspect of game play. And the general tendency is still to
keep things evened up.

My personal view is that, in the case of Power Grid, it is a bad thing.
The impact of the turn order is so great - particularly when moving
between phase 1 and phase 2 - that the game ceases to be about providing
power to cities, and becomes all about manipulating your position in
the turn order, with a side game of power management.
