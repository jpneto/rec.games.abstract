Nothing to see but the occasional tumble weed blowing through.  What a crap hole.  The rare post at bgg ag demonstrates total design ignorance.  E.g., the "incremental" approach.  Small minds making small changes.  Fucking retards.

From a pure "volume" point of view, I disagree on the "ghost town" definition. There is a quite significant amount of discussion ongoing.
However, I have to admit it has been swamped by too many "new games" lately.

By the way, is the "ms-designer" your account there ? I originally tough it was a Massakra52 sock-puppet, but maybe I was wrong after all.

In BGG no one is telling the truth.
All those who are posting but me and Nark are liars dishonests and hypocrits.
The forum is not the property of few but a property of anyone even if he or she is new member.
You are acting like kids by tumbing up your maffia members.
Even when a member say something wrong you thumb him up.
Ny advise to you : close it!!! 
Create a ghetto where all those who are not kow towing can not be part of the community. Then you will be like someone talking to himself a "collective autist". 
You are behaving like a tribe or sect.
As long as you are banishing people you do not agree with the forum will reach highest level of dumbness and incompetency.
I was banished not for not respecting the charter (It is a big lie) but because I said my thoughts loudly! 
The first thing I respect is honesty and competency.
I have no respect for dumb people trying to look smart.

No one intervene. The highly dumb Russ did not react.
