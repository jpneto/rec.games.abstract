<br>&nbsp;i see.&nbsp; but take Go.&nbsp; the smaller beginner board, 9x9 and the
<br>&nbsp;13x13 then finally the full 19x19.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;what are the accepted komi values again?&nbsp; arent they the same?
<br>&nbsp;about 5.5 for all 3 sizes?

<br>&nbsp;at 1st glance, it seems to my uneducated eye that there is a hard
<br>&nbsp;constant advantage in going 1st, no matter what the boardsize.

<br>&nbsp;i would like to see a proof of that.&nbsp; seems a curious result.

<br>
<br>&nbsp;maybe all that's needed is that the game tree become infinite, although
<br>&nbsp;right now i cant think of how you could have a finite game with an infinite
<br>&nbsp;game tree.

<br>&nbsp;so i need to be convinced of this.

<br>&nbsp;true, but i think we shouldnt worry about the beginners in this discussion.

<br>
<br>As far as breaking up the game into multi-move turns, I don't like that idea.
<br>&nbsp;You're effectively increasing the granularity, or decreasing the total
<br>number of moves, making it even more vulnerable to first move advantage - the
<br>very thing you're trying to avoid.

<br>
<br>&nbsp;i'm just going to 2 moves.&nbsp; the 1st player gets 1 move.&nbsp; the last player
<br>&nbsp;to play in a finite useable game would have had an advantage of more value
<br>&nbsp;in turns that is close to 1.00.&nbsp; this might, in the end, only convert the
<br>&nbsp;1st move advantage into a last move advantage.&nbsp; :-/&nbsp; there are probably
<br>&nbsp;games where the value of turn steadily decreases ala exponential decay,
<br>&nbsp;and the 2nd player never recovers from the 1st move in this manner.
