Below are three short games I've played. I'd be interested to
know if anyone has played these games, has thoughts on strategy,
etc.

 1) The 'knight's tour' game. Start with a chess knight on a corner
 2) The game with no name. Play on 1/2 a chessboard (4x8). Each player
    has a chess king (which moves just like in chess). A move in this
    game consists of making a move with your king, then marking any
    square on the board. The square you marked then may not be moved
    onto by either player. Last person able to move wins. The starting
    positions are squares (2,2) and (3,7) in col/row notation.

A game essentially equivalent to the one you mention (change board
dimensions a little and make the starting immune to marking) was
marketed under the name "isolation"

It had a tile board where you "marked" a square by punching it through
the supporting platic grid, leaving a hole.
