Contrivance is a good thing.  No abstract game, including Checkers,

Guess I'm torn on this point.  On one hand, invention always does seem
to involve imitation in one way or another.  There's no new thing under
the sun.

Contrivance is kind of the opposite of imitation.  I think we're just
talking semantics here but contrivance is defined as "to plan with
ingenuity," and "to form or create in an artistic or ingenious manner."
 In some contexts contrive has a negative connotation.  But regarding
invention it only connotes cleverness.

OK.  But the original remark that all this is connected to is:
"Some mechanisms in new games appear contrived to me."

I seriously doubt if the person who said that meant for "contrived" to
be synonymous with "clever."

According to my dictionary, the adjective "contrived" means
"artificial, labored."  And it sounds like that's just what it was
intended to mean in the original statement just quoted.
