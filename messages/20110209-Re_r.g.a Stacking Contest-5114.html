The judging idea seems okay but I agree that there ought to be at
least 3 judges. It's hardly fair to the other entrants if
Schmittberger has some partiality for a particular designer. I'm not
doubting his integrity but I have to figure that at a subconscious
level it would affect how he reviewed the games. Two other judges
would balance this out.

For this year's contest I agree, though I must politely refrain from
any suggestions. We're asking people to invest time, and ideally they
would like it for the sake of abstract games, but that may be a bit
meagre for a reward.

Concerning Wayne Schmittberger you seem to say that you trust him, but
not his subconscious. How far exactly do you plan to extend your
distrust? I fully agree with a panel rather than one person, but not
on this kind of reasoning. How exactly a judge arrives at his
conclusion is not an issue, so you either don't trust Wayne to be a
judge and say so beforehand, or trust him and shut up.
All presuming that he would be interested in the first place, and
since his subconscious is already held in questionable regard, I don't
think he will.

P.S. In case you meant me wih the 'particular designer', I haven't had
contact with Wayne for at least 5 years now.

In the early days there was this conspiracy of people telling one
another the truth and trusting one another. Fortunately this has now
made place for gross exaggeration and the presumption of ill intent -
aren't we lucky.
