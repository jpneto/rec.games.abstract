Already did that.  Perhaps you missed them.  If so, then let me repeat
it.

1: The title was not fairly won.
2: The title was accepted and not resigned.
3: To accept/not resign a title that was not fairly won is poor
sportsmanship.
4:Therefore, the chinook team showed poor sportsmanship.


1: This has been established.  Even the chinook team has admitted
this; to quote Jonathan, "Had we legitimately won the title ..."
                         "To be 'world champion' while Tinsley is
                         still alive and undefeated is ridiculous."
2: Obviously true.
3: True under the normal definition of poor sportsmanship.
4: Follows logically from 1 -- 3.

To the claim that the chinook team accepted the title to please the
sponsors, I say that this is in no way a valid excuse.  You are always
free to act as you wish and are thus, always responsible for your own
actions.  Trying to abdicate the responsibility for your own actions
does not cut it.

Let me suggest what is required.  To prove poor sportsmanship, you
have to find two opposing sportsmen, one of whom thinks he has been
wronged.  I think you'll have a hard time in this case.  Since
Tinsley more or less directed the course of events (he specified that
the title should go to the Chinook team), he doesn't think he has
been wronged.  If Tinsley were to complain about poor sportsmanship,
you might be justified in lining up behind him.  But he didn't. 
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Wrong!  To prove poor sportsmanship, you have to show how somebody
acted in an unsportsmanlike manner.  The fact that Tinsley is such a
nice guy is irrelevant.

An accusation of poor sportsmanship is a personal attack.  Enough said.

Your taking this out of context.  I was referring to the ad hominem
attacks such as your calling someone a bozo.  Providing arguments to
support a claim of poor sportsmanship is NOT an ad hominem attack.
