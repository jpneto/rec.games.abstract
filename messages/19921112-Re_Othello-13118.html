Mobility optimization?  I guess you've had more challenging competition than
I ever did.  I've always managed to win my games by forcing my opponents
to give up edges to me.  After that, they always lose quickly.  Another 
fun strategy is to try to get as few squares as possible, until my opponent
has to forfeit.  I don't know if that works in real games, but against the
computer program I have (anyone can beat it), the score is about 40-5 for 
black, and then I control the events for the next 19 moves.  Walkover.
