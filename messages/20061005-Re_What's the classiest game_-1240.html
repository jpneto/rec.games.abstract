<div class="moz-text-flowed">Quoting Bruno Wolff III's message of Tuesday:
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Now if one player is not picking random values with uniform distribution or
<br>if there is some correlation between plays, then the other player will in
<br>theory be able to eventually discover this bias (if they play a lot of
<br>games) and try to take advantage of it.
<br></blockquote>
<br>That's true, and this is one side of the "skill" of the game.
<br>
<br><blockquote type=cite>Even if a person doesn't have dice, if they think about it before playing
<br>a series of games, they could probably come up with a system that is good
<br>enough to avoid pattern detection over a few dozen plays.
<br></blockquote>
<br>And this is the other side of the "skill"--you might come up with a 
system, but there is the possibility that your experienced opponent 
knows it.
<br>
<br>By the way, Bruno, please ignore the question I directed to you in my 
message to Arthur--you've answered it already here.
