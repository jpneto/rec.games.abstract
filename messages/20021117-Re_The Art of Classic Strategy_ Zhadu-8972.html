Friends,

I would like to announce that you may now download the complete rules
( .pdf file ) from the "Mastery" section of the Zhadu site.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Thank you. The PDF covers one of the two areas I had not already inferred
from the web site: that is, initial placement.

The other area, which I hope you can clear up here, concerns stones doubling
back on themselves and other ways in which a stone's path can interact with
itself.

Can the 2-stone end up where it starts -- by reversing its path in the
middle of its movement? Even if the 2-stone can't do that, can the 3-stone
or 4-stone end up where it starts by going around a 'circle'?

I think I can answer my other questions for myself if you answer those two.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

-----&gt; I'm glad that you found the .pdf guidelines helpful. To answer
your question, a stone may NOT move to the same space more than once
during its' movement. It  must always move to a new space while
"travelling", so in this case a stone may not go around a 'circle'.

Although, I have not made the "official" announcement yet, with the
notation system, it is possible to play Zhadu through email and other
forms of correspondence. I can tell you personally, that an email game
adds a new dimension to the game and it's addicting.

If you or anyone else is interested before the "announcement" date, I
can send you the neccessary material. Also stay tuned, the free
monthly newsletter is on it's way which will include strategies,
hints, tips, analysis of some example games, etc.

Thanks again for your insight,
