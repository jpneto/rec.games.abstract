Any other tips/observations?

The main thing is: control! The only way to control what happens is by
giving your opponent marbles. Remove the right rings, reposition the marbles
on the board. You may give as many marbles as you want, as long as you keep
two things in mind: don't give your opponent a winning set (surprised?!) and
see that you get more out of it afterwards.
If you don't see a possibility to get more out of it, then change your way
of thinking and look for the opposite: try to find a spot where you can
place a marble without giving opponent the opportunity to start dictating
what will happen next. (And if you can't find such a spot, then you are in
trouble!)

In short: play Zertz with the attidude of predator! Be patient until you see
a chance. If you see a chance, grab it and try to finish the game in one
rush.
