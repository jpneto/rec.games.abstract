is just another asshole with an internet connection, no need writing a
treatise on the state of mediocrity that exists in western society
today just because he did something dopey. Alright? You're preaching
to the choir here. That's Mark Steere and maybe a disgruntled Michael Howe.

Good point, but you saw what I saw didn't you? Bill wanted to put me
in my place from the very start. Had I complied, then I would have
surrendered to his 'authority' and be caught in his 'rub me the right
way and I'll repay (with flattery) web'. It wasn't about games at al.
He needed a ridiculous statement and an equally ridiculous argument to
get that message across.

I'd like to talk about games without weighing every word while
watching my back. Why would I join a group where I'm guaranteed to
have to do just that because Bill perceives himself as the radiant
center? Whatever I say, it can always be derailed by someone who bends
the facts to serve his arguments. Even Mediocrity can manage that.
