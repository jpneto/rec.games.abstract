For some reason, this thread didn't appear in my view of this forum
until today, even though I posted it many days ago.  I just thought my
post got lost in the intertubes. So, apologies for not replying
sooner.

I'm glad you guys think it's ok.

Mark: I'll lay off the daresays.

One objection, Mark. You say:

"You're basically trying to form the largest group.  If that ties,
then it's
anybody's guess who has the second, third, and fourth largest groups,
etc."

In fact, the second largest group usually goes to the player who has
spent more time trailing.  So this is a little extra incentive to push
your luck and try to come from behind rather than get out into the
lead early.  In my experience so far, the second-largest groups come
into play 10-20% of the time, and the third largest groups very
rarely.  I've yet to play a game where the third largest matters.  The
fact that you're only worrying about your two largest groups also
keeps it from being "anybody's guess"
