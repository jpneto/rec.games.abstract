This thread is going to talk about the impact first move advantage and
draw rate has on match play.  This includes only even number of games,
set limit match play, and says nothing about tournament play, casual
one of matches, best of an odd number of games, or matches with no
maximum length, all of which different criteria need be applied, or
the analysis changes.

All comparisons are to the mythical perfectly decisive game of no
draws and 50% win percentage for both sides

1st Draw Rate:  Draw rate is simple, if you draw 20% of the time, you
need 5/4 the number of matches to have an acceptable degree of
decisiveness.  if you draw half the time, you need twice the number of
matches, basically draws just count for nothing as far as decisiveness
matters, so you just need the right number of matches with a decisive
outcome.  This means chess, with its 50% draw rate at top level match
play requires twice as many matches (ignoring first move advantage) as
the ideal matches

2nd First Move Advantage:
First assume decisiveness of the match is judged by distance from the
expected overall tie.
Second, lets now use standard deviation to judge distance from the
null. (square root (first player's win probabiliy * second player's
win probability))
ideal is (.5*.5)^.5=.5
This is the highest deviation.  To match this, you must play the
square of the division of this sd with your own game's sd.
Shogi's first move advantage (.505*.495)^.5=.49997
(.5/.49997)^2=1.0001 or one extra game every 8000. realistically, no
effect on match play

chess's first move advantage level (.55*.45)^.5=.497
(.5/.497)^2=1.012 (only requiring one extra match every 80 games)
Chess's first move advantage level if draws are eliminated (.583*.
417)^.5=.493
(.5/.493)^2=1.029, or one extra game every 35 (almost exactly 35)

I think from these two we can dispell that chess's first move
advantage is too large in match conditions since if you play just one
extra game you would have a better result than the theoretical best.

Now for a couple of rediculous ones:
..667 for first move = 1.125 or an extra match per 8
..8 for first move = 1.563 or more than extra every other
..9 for first move = 2.777 or in other words, starting to get
rediculous

and it sky rockets from there, but as you can see, the number of games
in a match required by a .8 first move advantage is quite reasonable,
and thus its match play is not the problem, and the "tennis" back and
forth can easily be made just as decisive as its 'anything goes'
competators.

demonstration of principle
Best of 4 matches perfect game even players
..0625 chance of a sweep win (same for sweep loss)
..25 chance of a 3-1 result (same for 1-3)
..375 chance of a 2-2 tied result at end

Best of 6 matches first player advantage .789 win percentage (the
amount needed to have 1.5 times the number of matches be on even
footing), even players.
..004 chance of sweep win (half the drop is from the win percentage,
the rest is from the extra 2 games)
..055 chance of 5-1 win
..236 chance of 4-2 win
..407 chance of 3-3 tie

A slight increase in matches drawn for a wider spread of possible
wins, this holds up for different first player advantages and larger
matches (like 12 matches vs 18), and in larger matches, the wider
spread of possible wins is more noticable and valuable [i'll post more
data if requested]

Best of 4 perfect game players split by 100 Elo (.640 win percentage)
Results for stronger player
0-4 0.017
1-3 0.119
2-2 0.319
3-1 0.377
4-0 0.168

Best of 6 matches first player advantage .789 win percentage (229 Elo)
players split by 100 Elo
Results for stronger player
0-6  0.001
1-5  0.015
2-4  0.113
3-3  0.346
4-2  0.355
5-1  0.148
6-0  0.022

as you can see, even in a battle of different players, the
distribution remains very similar to the ideal, just a little fatter
at draws (at even higher elo differences, the draw rate is lower for
more matches) in trade for the wide variety of wins.  And of course,
the short matches and very large first move advantage were used just
for example, larger match sizes, and smaller first move advantage will
merge everything together more.  (note that the stronger player
actually does better in match winning terms in the adjusted first
player advantage.

Thus, first move advantage is not a huge concern for match play as
lesser advantage needs few if any extra games to shore things up, and
larger can get pretty large with still having a reasonable fix to it
[at the levels where the number of extra games is a problem the game
prolly has bigger problems then lack of competative matchplay], draw
rate, however can cause problems for match play.


Note again that this is all for match play, tournament play analysis
is coming soon.  I'll explain why matches with no maximum length can't
be explained in the same reply.

Note that there are other reasons to level a game than decisive
tournaments.  The most important is casual one of matches.  Here, as
CF has pointed out elsewhere, casual players (which you need a base of
usually to build the serious players) usually only care about FPA if
it makes the game less fun, and you could have a reasonably high first
player advantage, and still get people playing (it will also play an
impact if someone is a jerk and only plays one side, but the casual
players will just stop playing games with that person all together)
My own experience with shogi handicap matches (when they are fun vs
when they serve just to teach) is that this level is reached when 2nd
player is allowed to choose his own fate, not just react to 1st player
or sit and wait for 1st player to act.  Basically, if second player
has only a 1/3 chance of victory, but he can say he set up his
victory, it will probably still be ok for casual market, but if a game
has a 1/2 chance of victory, but 2nd player will feel like all his
wins were because first player blundered, and not because he did
anything to create that blunder, then it likely won't be so popular

The other main one is best of 7's (and other odd numbers), which are
possible when first move advantage is close and not when they arn't.
However this also is only possible if you have a strong organization
running the show and respectful players like shogi, and not a weak
organization running the show with players acting like 3 year olds
like chess where they would complains about the differences even if
they had no real basis on advantage (hey, everyone knows my opponent
players better when he goes 2nd!  why does he get to go second 4
times!)
