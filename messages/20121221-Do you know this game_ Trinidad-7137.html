Hello,

Do you know this game?
Trinidad!
Who plagiarized it?

Let me quote something interesting 

"Overcoming the limitations of Hex
For some time I have been thinking about a variant of Hex, in which tactics would be more important and more drama and excitement would be introduced to the game. In this new game neither the goal nor the hexagon board is changed. Also preserved is the fact that the number of pieces is constantly growing, so that the game is forced to end and will never be a draw. What I díd want to change is that pieces should be allowed to move during the game. 
      The new game has been called Trinidad. In this game, each player can add stones to the board, and subsequently move his stones. More specifically, in each turn a player may (1) add a stone to an empty field, which is adjacent to a stone of his own and (2) move a row of his stones as far as the length of the row. Trinidad turns out to be a lot more exciting than Hex. The course of the game can be dramatically altered by certain moves. Both strategic planning and smart tactical thinking are needed. For a full discusion of Trinidad and for a Windows program for learning the game, see the Trinidad page"
