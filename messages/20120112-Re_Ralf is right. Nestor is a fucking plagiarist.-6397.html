I don't know. Maybe not for the money. Only an idiot would
commercialize boardgames, abstract games especially, for the money,
since it's such an abysmal way to chase gold coins (low margins, tiny
upside, small market). It's like going into mathematics for the sex.

Yes, the best way to make a small fortune with abstract games, is to
start with a big one. ;-)

Although, thinking about the way Nestor's productions work, maybe his
margins are better than average. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure
his buyer base is small, or at least too small for anyone (idiots
excepted) whose main goal is money.

I couldn't tell, the site looks professional enough and the games
selection shows a certain love for abstracts. At the same time it's
rather toyish and Kris Burm-like: make sure to use material that
buyers wouldn't have lying around. It's all right with me, but Omega
keeps me wondering ... surely Bill Taylor would have noticed it is his
game?
