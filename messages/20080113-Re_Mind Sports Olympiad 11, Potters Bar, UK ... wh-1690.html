It's been three months since the Mind Sports Olympiad for 2007.
Nowhere on their website are any results from any of the scheduled
tournaments.

I would greatly appreciate info from anyone who attended. Were there
in fact any tournaments held at all? Was everyone abducted by aliens?
Is this one of those reality warps that Philip K. Dick wrote about?
Did whatsisface abscond with the money?

Hi David

1) I understand that there should be some more info re results on the MSO
website shortly.
</pre></blockquote><pre wrap class="moz-quote-pre">

Well here it is one month later, now FOUR months since the event, and
no results from MSO 11 are shown. There are a few changes to the
website, but it's still pathetic.

7) MSO are already planning a Central London Event for August 2008
8) Venue and future were discussed at the meeting with participants keen to
see a return to a more central venue.  The continuing issues (in the view of
many) are enough funding and organisation to get a good venue and market it
the event successfully.   The event currently relies on a good deal of
voluntary labour and good will.

I wish you luck and I hope you will post any new developments here.
