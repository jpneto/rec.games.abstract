<div class="moz-text-flowed">Interesting idea.
<br>
<br>You mind if I think about adding it to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:pbmserv@gamerz.net">pbmserv@gamerz.net</a> (and let
<br>it be the referree)?
<br>
<br>Also, ties could be "even-odds" resolved.
<br>
<br>I submit a location+bid.&nbsp; If we both pick the same place, our bids
<br>are added together.&nbsp; If the sum is even, player 2 (the even player)
<br>gets the hex.&nbsp; If odd, player 1 gets it.

<br>Actually, I doubt I'm the first to come up with this idea wrt Hex, and it
<br>could be (and sometimes has been) applied to many abstract games.
<br>
<br>The idea is to have simultaneous movement, rather than the swap rule. Each
<br>player secretly indicated their intended hex, and then the intentions are
<br>revealed. If each player chooses the same hex, then the process is repeated
<br>except that the originally intended hex of off-limits until the next time
<br>pieces are successfully placed (sort of like in Diplomacy).
<br>
<br>One thing to note, is that while the concept is somewhat applicable to
<br>almost any game, in most of them (I suspect) it would lead to frequent
<br>simultaneous wins for each side. (Imagine checkmate being delivered to each
<br>king in chess.) In Hex that can't happen, though it could lead to draws if
<br>all remaining hexes have placed off-limits so that no moves are possible.
<br>
<br>I'm not a very good Hex player, so I don't think I should be the one to test
<br>this. But I'd be happy to referee, receiving the secret moves and reporting
<br>them when I've received them from both players. I suggest an even-hexed
<br>board, so as to reduce the chance of first-turn deadlocks. If anyone is
<br>interested in playing, please reply on- or off-line.
