<br>Hive is an interesting success story, I think. Wasn't it self-
<br>published originally? How often does it happen that a self-published

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Silverton is another example. The designer self-published the game 
under the Two Wolf name. It is now licensed to Mayfair, which has made 
some nice improvements to the rules and the components. I do not know if 
this licensing came about before or after he passed away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall seeing the designer demoing the game at Strategicon in L.A. 
when he first published it. It is, in my opinion, the <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>best<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b>, most 
realistic railroad game on the market. The varying prices of commodities 
and the possibility of claims playing out are excellent features that 
make it much more realistic than Empire Builder or anything else I can 
think of.
