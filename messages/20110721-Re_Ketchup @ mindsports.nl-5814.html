That's an interesting strategic principal.  Might be true.  I assume
you're not talking about playing time, though, such as super large
chess variants that are unplayable because of slowness and time.
You're talking about something more mechanically intrinsic, right?  By
the way Nick, I'm not saying that this principle describes Ketchup
(ugh, can't we rename it Salsa or Picante or something with more zip?)
because my instinct is that you're wrong about larger boards.

I'm often wrong, and this case may be no different. Picante Bah! Good
names aren't my niche.

I think Mark means that on small boards good players are likely to
find optimal or near-optimal play quickly, at which point it gets
boring without going to larger board. Recycling can be a way out, but
of course it's not a sure way out. Here's an example of a terrible
game with massive recycling on a small board, which let's call ReHex.

Players play a normal game of hex on a small board, until one player
comes within one stone of victory. Then all the stones are cleared
from the board and the players continue. This is repeated 100 times,
and then on the 100th time the game is allowed to finish as a normal
game of Hex.

This becomes a sort of counting game with a lot of coldness where
you're trying to lobby to become the first mover on the 100th game.
Alot of games with big recycling concepts in them seem to suffer from
similar issue, if my own attempts at recycling games are any
indication.  Mark: does Rive?

Anyway, recycling works when it excites nice geometrical ideas in the
players' brains, rather than counting, IMO

Anyway, I don't think that recycling is the only way "out" of the
small board problem. Ketchup was designed with "negative
feedback" (the leading player makes weaker moves than the trailing
player) in an attempt to create deep play on a small board. I've
played maybe ~150 times now, and it's held up to my assaults so far on
a hexhex5 board.  Might say more about me than the game, but there you
have it.
