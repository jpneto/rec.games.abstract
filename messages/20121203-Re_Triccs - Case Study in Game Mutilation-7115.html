Yes Triccs seemed rather lacking direction to me. Christian described it as a process of "hunting" but what he was hunting I cannot tell, perhaps the rare and most coveted Jabberwocky? I have no idea. It is also unlike him to not explain what one of his games is about. Why would he mention he was hunting something without mentioning what that something was? Frustrating...
