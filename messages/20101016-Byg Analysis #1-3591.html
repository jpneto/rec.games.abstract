Abstract game designers publish many designs but not much analysis.

This is odd, if not sinful. Isn't our goal to design games harboring
catacombs of secrets, waiting to be discovered? Unless we enter the
catacombs and report our findings, we neglect to partake of the very
pleasures we set out to create. It seems a waste.

And so I've resolved to write about my effort to understand Byg, my
new game (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-byg">http://nickbentley.posterous.com/new-game-byg</a>).

I've been evaluating the two versions, and today my friend Scadeau and
I played some test games. Insights were had.

First, we played on a Hexhex5 board, and it wasn't too small. Good:
small-board play is less likely to intimidate new players.

Second, Scadeau, a (WBC champion) Eurogamer who's played many of my
games, declared that Byg is my best. Since I dream of designing
abstracts with appeal beyond our weensy group of abstract players, his
sentiment is encouraging. He liked it enough that he's going to design
a Eurogame around it (now that I've said it in public, you're locked-
in my friend! How do you like that gambit?)

Our most important insight: we prefer the version where a player can
create only one new group on his turn, rather than 2. Here's why:

A key moment in each contest is the turn when one player switches from
group-creation to group-growth for the first time. The fun wratchets
up at this point, so it should come early. The less powerful group-
creation is relative to group-growth, the sooner it will come. Group-
creation is weaker when you can only create one group rather than two,
so the design choice is clear. One caveat: the key moment shouldn't
come so early as to create an advantage to one player based on turn
order. We have yet to know how early that is. We may have to revise
our conclusions later to adjust for this.

It occurs to me that there is another group-creation rule intermediate
between the one- and two-group-creation rule: you can create one 2-
stone group. Since I don't yet know where the sweet spot lies, it'll
be important to test this version.

Another way to make group-growth happen earlier is to make it more
powerful. One way to do this might be to remove the rule which says
that a stone connecting 2 or three groups is considered to have grown
them all. But that might be too powerful. I'll test it and report
later.

Strategy note: the center is often a poor place to have a group, at
least on the hexhex5 board. The reason:

If your groups are close to each other too early, you may be forced
either to a) connect too soon; or b) not grow one or more of your
groups when you choose group-growth, to avoid connection. The problem
with having a central group is that it can make all your groups too
connected, too soon.

This last observation points to a general truth: Byg is not completely
hot. Rather it's both hot and cold, depending on where in the game's
arc you are and on the the geometry of your groups. The mixture lends
variety and subtlety, another reason to rejoice. The presence of some
cold moments also makes first-mover advantage less likely to be a
problem.

So far so good. Further reports coming soon.  Stay thirsty, my
friends.
