The following game (tentatively called "Cascade") is played by two
players.

Components needed:

 - An NxN squared board, such as a Checker board.  Colours don't
   matter, so you can use Reversi boards or Go boards (though the
   latter would probably be too big).

 - Three sets of coloured stones, for example white, black and red.

The players sit side-by-side (not opposite each other) and the board
is placed in front of them with one corner to the edge of the table
(i.e., with the diagonals aligned with the table edges).  This corner
is "down".  The board starts empty.

The players take turns placing a stone of <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>any<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span> colour on any empty
square on the board.  After a stone is placed, other stones are added
based on the following rules:

 - If an empty square is directly below two squares holding stones of
   the same colour, a stone of that colour is placed in the empty
   square.

 - If an empty square is directly below two squares holding stones of
   different colours, a stone of the third colour is placed in the
   empty square.

This is repeated until no empty square is directly below two filled
squares.  Then the turn passes to the other player.

The game ends when all squares are filled.  Player 1 wins if there are
more white stones than black stones on the board and vice-versa.
There can be ties.

As a variant, you also fill empty squares above two filled squares.
This will make the game play faster.  If you do this, you can place
the players opposite each other.
