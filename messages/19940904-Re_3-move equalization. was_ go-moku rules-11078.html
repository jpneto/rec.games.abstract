[description of three-move equalization] deleted]

It is a good rule (but see below), and it is probably a pity that it
didn't come to anybody's mind in the end of 19th century, when the
Japanese found that Black wins in unrestricted gomoku and started to
look for changes in the rules.  But now it's just too late, for gomoku
as well as for other games.  Heck, even after the first changes were
tried and turned out inadequete it was <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>already<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> to late to come up with
something clean and new -- instead, more and more rules were added.
Evolution...  Now there are several go-moku variations in use but the
strongest players play Renju and it's not going to change -- the
incentive of using the same rules as the strongest guys is too high.
Renju reproduced itself in Swedish and ex-Soviet gomoku communities,
which were originally tabulas rasas (sp? ha!).

And IMHO you are a bit too harsh to Renju rules.  I agree that the
three-move equalization  rule is simple, natural, effective etc. but it
doesn't make it "better" than the "frightful mess of horrid Japanese
excrescences" (had to look that one in a dictionary).  There are no
"good" rules.

One problem with the three-move equalization (that you see but IMHO
underestimate) is that it allows the Placer such an enormous choice of
three-move sequences that he can prepare a sequence that leads to a
very complicated position that the Placer had analyzed beforehand and
the Chooser sees for the first time in his life.  To prevent this, in
Renju the second move is made by the Chooser, and the third move (made
by the Placer) is not entirely free.  To eliminate this danger for other
games, it will probably be necessary to make game-specific patches for
the general rule and such patches can turn into horrid excrescences very
fast.  And of course that's exactly the way horrid excrescences appear:
as clean and natural patches to clean and natural patches to etc.
So maybe it wouldn't make a difference if the three-move equalization
for gomoku had been invented 100 years ago.

Cheers,
Leonid
