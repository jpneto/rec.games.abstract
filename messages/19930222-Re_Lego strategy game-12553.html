I disagree.  How can a game be fairly complex, yet have simple rules?
The two don't mix.

They do mix.  Examples are chess and go.

not only do they mix, but it is a desired goal to maximize

          ---------------------------
               rule simplicity

for much of what we mean when we talk about Abstract Games.
a counter-example of what belongs in this group - and nothing
against them, they are also fine games - would be those Role-Playing
games with mountains of rules, or those simulation games played
on hexgrids with (again) mountains of rules.  while those kinds
of games are fine, i dont think they belong in this group.  what
we look for (i think) are games like chess or go, but not those
because they have their own groups.  infact there should be a
group for othello/reversi and the chinese chess game that i cant
remember how to spell (Xiang Chi???) along with shogi.

i think the kind of games that do belong here are Sprouts, SUSAN,
Abalone - things like that.

and i also think that this newsgroup can be a clearinghouse for
new games, such as SUSAN and the Lego game.  i have some games of
my own that i would like to see tried out here, and also have
reservations about "giving" them away.  it is hard to guess what
kind of protection we can provide in a public newsgroup.  perhaps
what i am thinking about is something similar to the Free Software
Foundation's habit of putting those copyright notices in everything
they put out, with the caveat that you can make only copies that
also include that copyright.  the software is free, but you must
include the copyright notice in its entireity.  perhaps we can set
up a similar process here.

it may be that the best we can do is protect free games and those that
wish to market a game outside of this newsgroup, for the purposes of
making money, should go follow appropriate procedure (perhaps) outlined
in a FAQ.  what i can see coming is a kind of "registration" with this
group to provide proof of first publishing.

however, it is my understanding that a game needs all 3 of those
protection things:  copyright, trademark and patent

the trademark is so that you cant come out with a different game and
call it "MONOPOLY".  the copyright protects your expression of the
rules and the diagrams and the drawings included.  the patent protects
the idea and is the most expensive, by far.  it is this expense that
i'm looking to avoid with this process.  i would like to hear other
people's views on this in the group.
